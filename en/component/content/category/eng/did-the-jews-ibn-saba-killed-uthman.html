    <p>From the Siege of Uthman, then till his killing .... then from killing of Uthman to war of Siffin against Ali ... and then from Siffin till brining army against Imam Hassan, one and only aim of Muawiyyah was to gain worldly power and Caliphate.</p>
<h2>Muawiyyah was hungry of Caliphate, he deemed himself having more right upon Caliphate than 'Ali, and he fought for this world and Caliphate</h2>
<p><strong class="bbc"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4108">Sahih al-Bukhari 4108</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Ikrima bin Khalid: Ibn '<strong class="bbc">umar</strong> said, "I went to Hafsa while water was dribbling from her twined braids. I said, 'The condition of the people is as you see, and no authority has been given to me.' Hafsa said, (to me), 'Go to them, and as they (i.e. the people) are waiting for you, and I am afraid your absence from them will produce division amongst them.' " So Hafsa did not leave Ibn '<strong class="bbc">umar</strong> till we went to them. When the people differed. <strong class="bbc">muawiya</strong>addressed the people saying, <strong class="bbc">"'If anybody wants to say anything in this matter of the Caliphate, he should show up and not conceal himself, <span class="bbc_underline">for we are more rightful to be a Caliph than he (i.e. Hassan) and his father (i.e. Ali)</span>." </strong>On that, Habib bin Masalama said (to Ibn '<strong class="bbc">umar</strong>), "Why don't you reply to him (i.e. <strong class="bbc">muawiya</strong>)?"'Abdullah bin '<strong class="bbc">umar</strong> said, "I untied my garment that was going round my back and legs while I was sitting and was about to say,<strong> <span class="bbc_underline">'He who fought against you and against your father for the sake of Islam, is more rightful to be a Caliph</span>,</strong>' but I was afraid that my statement might produce differences amongst the people and cause bloodshed, and my statement might be interpreted not as I intended. (So I kept quiet) remembering what Allah has prepared in the Gardens of Paradise (for those who are patient and prefer the Hereafter to this worldly life)." Habib said, "You did what kept you safe and secure." </p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Muawiyyah threatening Great Sahaba</h1>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, Vol.15, page 152:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was related to me by 'Abdallah b. Ahmad b. Shabbawayh-- his father – 'Abdallah--Ishaq b. Yahya-Musa b. Talhah: 'Uthman sent for Talhah, and I accompanied him. When he entered 'Uthman’s presence, there were 'Ali, Sa‘d (b. Abi Waqqas), al-Zubayr, 'Uthman, and Mu'awiyah. Mu'awiyah praised God and extolled Him as He merits, and then he said, "You are the Companions of the Messenger of God, the best (of His followers) on earth, and those charged with the affair s of this Community.<strong> No one other than you can hope for that (to become Caliph after 'Uthman).</strong> You have chosen your companion (as caliph) without compulsion or personal ambition. He has grown old and his life has passed by. If you had waited for decrepitude [to afflict] him, that would be near at hand. However, I hope that he has revered God so that He will allow him to reach that stage of life. Talk has spread, and I fear it for your sakes, for you have not denounced it in any way. You have my aid (in this matter). <strong>Do not inspire the people to long for your government, for by God, if they desire that, you will never see them do any-thing but tum tail and flee." 'Ali replied, "What is that to you, and what do you know about it? You have no mother!"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Muawiyyah openly blamed grand Sahaba 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Talha, Zubair, Sa'ad bin Abi Waqas that they were inciting people against 'Uthman while they see their chances to become Caliph after 'Uthman.</p>
<h1>'Uthman's order to Muawiya to send the Army and Muawiya's insurrection</h1>
<p>History of Tabari, Year 35 Hijri:</p>
<blockquote>Ibn Jarir Tabari writes that it was related to me by ]a'far—‘Amr and ‘Ali—— Husayn—his father—Muhammad b. Sa'ib a1—Kalbi: The Egyptians returned to 'Uthman after having departed from him because a slave of his, riding one of his camels, overtook them carrying a letter to the governor of Egypt [with orders] to kill some of them and crucify others. When they came back to 'Uthman they said, "This is your slave." He said, "My slave went without my knowledge." They said, "[It is] your camel." He responded, "He took it from the house without my orders." They said, "[This is] your seal." "It was forged," he said. . » When the Egyptians arrived, 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Udays al-Tujibi and said: They came from Bilbays and Upper Egypt, long-necked, their eyes squinting like bows, Their flanks covered in chain mail. They demand God’s due from al-Walid, from 'Uthman and from Sa'id. O Lord, send us back with what we seek! When 'Uthman saw what had happened to him and how many of the people had been sent against him, <strong>he wrote Mu'awiyah b. Abi Sufyan in Syria: "In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. To proceed: The Medinese have become unbelievers , they have abandoned obedience and renounced their oath of allegiance. Therefore send to me the Syrian soldiers who are at your disposal, on every camel you have, whether docile or stubborn." When Mu'awiyah got the letter, he delayed action on it, for he did not wish to differ openly with the Companions of the Messenger of God, since he knew that they concurred [on this matter]. When 'Uthman became aware of the delay, he wrote to seek aid from other provinces... (The armies came from other provinces but when the people made camp at al-Rabadhah—the vanguard having located in a district of Medina named Sirar—they learned of ‘Uthman’s murder and thus they returned form there).</strong></blockquote>
<p>Thus, Muawiyah denied to send army to help Uthman. Later, Muawiya's demand for justice (for the murder of 'Uthman) was only a Drama, which he did in order to get support against 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib in the war.</p>
<h2>Witness of Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr that Muawiyyah didn't come to help Uthman</h2>
<p>History of Tabari, Year 35:</p>
<blockquote>It was related to me by Ya'qub b. Ibrahim - Isma'il b. Ibrahim- Ibn 'Awn-al-Hasan - Waththab. According to (al-Hasan): (Waththab) was one of those manumitted by the Commander of the Faithful Umar, and I saw on his throat the scars of two stab wounds, like a pair of leather thongs, which he had suffered on the Day of the House. According to (Waththab): 'Uthman sent me to summon al-Ashtar and he came . The Crisis of the Early Caliphate Ibn 'Awn thinks that Waththab went on as follows: I laid down a cushion for the Commander of the Faithful and another for (al-Ashtar). Then (Uthman) said, "Ashtar, what do the people want from me? " "You cannot avoid doing one of three things," he said. "What are they?" asked (Uthman). (Al-Ashtar) said, "They ask you to choose between (the following). You may turn their affairs over to them and say, 'This is your affair, choose whomever you will for it.' Second, you may have yourself punished. If you reject these two choices, then this band of men (qawm) will kill you." (Uthman) replied, "As for my turning their affairs over to them, I am not one to remove a robe that Almighty God has placed upon. ..." Al-Ashtar rose and hurried away, while we remained there for some days. Then a little man came like a wolf, peered in through the door, and then left. Muhammad b. Abi Bakr came with thirteen men and went up to 'Uthman.<strong> He seized his beard and shook it until I heard his teeth chattering. (Muhammad b. Abi Bakr) said, "Mu'awiyah was no help to you, nor was Ibn 'Amir nor your letters.</strong>"(Uthman) said, "Let go of my beard, son of my brother! Let go of my beard!" Then I saw (Ibn Abi Bakr) signaling with his eye to one of the rebels (qawm). He came over to him with a broad iron-headed arrow and stabbed him in the head with it. I [that is, Ibn 'Awn] asked, "Then what happened?" (Waththab) replied, "They gathered round him and killed him."</blockquote>
<h2>Ibn Abbas too knew the greedy nature of Muawiyyah</h2>
<blockquote>Ibn-e-Jareer Tabari narrates from Ibn-e-Abbas: Ibne 'Abbas said to 'Ali that Muawiya is a worldly person with materialistic desires and if you let him be the governor of Syria, he will forget the murder of 'Uthman and will favour you. (History of Tabari, english edition, vol:1, P;23)</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>There is not a SINGLE tradition (which is free of storyteller Saif Ibn Umar) which claims that Jews played any role in the killing of Uthman. However, Muslims still believe in this false propaganda and neglect all other tons of traditions which prove that Uthman was killed by companions and other Muslims. </p>

    <h2>Summary:</h2>
<p><strong>One of the main reasons that Muslims today harbor deep animosity towards Jews </strong>stems from the fictional and fabricated tale of Abdullah Ibn Saba.</p>
<p>Islamists fabricated and spread a false narrative in which they accused a Jew, Abdullah Ibn Saba, of plotting against the 3rd Caliph, Uthman. According to this story, Abdullah Ibn Saba allegedly misled thousands of Sahaba (companions of Muhammad) and Tabaeen (the second generation of Muslims), ultimately orchestrating Uthman’s assassination with their support.</p>
<p>However, this narrative is not based on credible evidence.</p>
<p>There are two <strong>completely contradictory narratives</strong> about Abdullah Ibn Saba present in Islamic literature:</p>
<h3>1. The first narrative (based on more authentic and widely reported traditions):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abdullah Ibn Saba was not a Jew</strong>, but a follower of Ali Ibn Talib, the 4th Muslim Caliph.</li>
<li><strong>He did not appear during Uthman’s time</strong> but emerged many years later, during Ali’s rule.</li>
<li><strong>He claimed Ali to be divine</strong>, which led Ali to condemn him and his few followers to be burnt for their apostasy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. The second narrative (fabricated and less credible):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abdullah Ibn Saba was a Jew</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>He appeared during Uthman’s caliphate</strong> and began conspiring against the Muslim state.</li>
<li><strong>He misled thousands of Sahaba and Tabaeen</strong> in record time, traveling to different Muslim cities, successfully inciting rebellion. None of the Companions or Tabeen opposed him in those cities. </li>
<li>Eventually, Abdullah Ibn Saba and his followers arrived in Medina, where they accused Uthman of corruption, particularly for appointing his relatives from the Banu Umayya clan to key positions of power. These accusations culminated in the assassination of Caliph Uthman in Medina.</li>
<li>Later, the Jewish figure Abdullah Ibn Saba was also allegedly involved in the <strong>Battle of Jamal</strong>. Initially, neither the Muslim army of Ali (the 4th Caliph) nor that of Aisha (the wife of Muhammad) intended to fight each other. However, Abdullah Ibn Saba and his followers conspired by secretly firing arrows from within both camps, creating confusion and misunderstanding. As a result, the two Muslim forces engaged in battle, leading to the tragic deaths of thousands of companions and Tabaeen, with the blame placed on the conspiracies of the Jewish figure Ibn Saba. Later, the same thing happened in the <strong>Battle of Siffin</strong>. Once again, Muawiyyah's army initially did not want to engage in battle against Ali's army. However, the Saba'ites (followers of Ibn Saba) on both sides conspired by firing arrows at both armies, provoking them into starting the war.</li>
</ul>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>second narrative</strong> about Abdullah Ibn Saba is attributed to <strong>only one source</strong>:<strong> <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 2);">Saif Ibn Umar</span>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Saif Ibn Umar</strong> wrote this story about 170 years after Muhammad’s death. In his book, he fabricated the fantastical account that Abdullah Ibn Saba was responsible for misleading thousands of Sahaba and Tabaeen, ultimately leading to Uthman's assassination due to a Jewish conspiracy.</li>
<li>Saif Ibn Umar is widely regarded as <strong>unreliable</strong> and labeled a <strong>liar and storyteller</strong> by Muslim scholars themselves.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, esteemed Muslim scholars and historians such as Tabari, Dhahabi, Ibn Asakir, and Ibn Kathir included the fabricated accounts of Sayf Ibn Umar in their works. That is why these false narratives of Saif Ibn Umar became widely accepted within Islamic history. Later, even Western historians, relying on these sources, repeated Sayf Ibn Umar's fabrications in their own writings, further perpetuating these inaccuracies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why Muslim scholars promoted the fictitious and fabricated stories of Saif Ibn Umar, and why these tales gained popularity among the Muslim masses, is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>It concealed the uncomfortable aspects of early Islamic history, such as the corruption of the so-called Rightly-Guided 3rd Caliph, Uthman, and his governors, and how the companions (the highly esteemed first Muslim generation) were involved in Uthman’s assassination.</li>
<li>It also obscured the troubling historical events where Ali and Aisha fought against each other, leading to the deaths of thousands of Muslims on both sides.</li>
<li>By attributing all blame to the Jewish figure Abdullah Ibn Saba and his alleged conspiracies, these difficult aspects of Islamic history were downplayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that for Muslims, the first four caliphs are regarded as <strong>divinely</strong> <strong>guided </strong>and are seen as nearly free from corruption or sin. Similarly, companions of Muhammad are also believed to be nearly sinless and they are <strong>MERCIFUL</strong> towards each other (Ref: Surah Al-Fath 48:29) . However, early Islamic history presents an opposite picture, highlighting conflicts and corruption and self-interests that led to bloodshed among Muslims. These events, which resulted in the deaths of thousands at the hands of one another, are difficult for many Muslims to reconcile with the <strong>idealized</strong> view of these figures.</p>
<p>In simple terms:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Chronological Events of the year 35 Hijri from "The History of Tabari":</h2>
<p>If one truly wants to understand the reasons behind the assassination of the 3rd Caliph, Uthman, in the heart of the Islamic Caliphate amidst thousands of Sahaba and Tabaeen, it is essential to examine the <strong>detailed and chronological events of the year 35 Hijri</strong>, as they reveal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did the companions of Muhammad turn against Uthman?</li>
<li>What were the major grievances of the people from other provinces, largely stemming from the misconduct of the Banu Umayyah governors?</li>
<li>The role and character of the people of Madina, and how they contributed to Uthman's murder.</li>
<li>The failed responses and critical mistakes made by Uthman, including broken promises and attempts to harm the Egyptian rebels.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, we present <strong>all relevant traditions</strong> regarding the events of 35 Hijri from the "History of Tabari," in a chronological order. Notably, we exclude narrations from <strong>Saif Ibn Umar</strong>, as his reports are widely regarded as fabrications, contradicting other reliable narrations.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId100934"></a>Criticism by Ali upon Uthman and his Governors</h2>
<h3>First Tradition:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>According to al-Waqidi-—'Abdallah b. Muhammad--his father: the year 34 (654-55] certain of the<strong> </strong>Companions (Sahaba) of the Messenger of God wrote to others [as follows]: "Come, for if you desire the jihad, then the jihad is here with us." The people maligned 'Uthman and censured him in the harshest language ever used against anyone, while the Companions of the Messenger of God were giving their opinions and listening, and among them no one forbade or prevented this save a few individuals: Zayd b. Thabit, Abit Usavd al-Sa'idi, Ka'b b. Malik, and Hassan b. Thabit. The people assembled and spoke to 'Ali b. Abi Talib, and he entered 'Uthman's presence and said, "The people stand behind me, and they have spoken to me about you. By God, I do not know what to say to you. I know nothing of which you are ignorant, nor can I point out to you any affair with which you are not well acquainted. Indeed you know what we know. We have not perceived something before you have, so that we must inform you of it. Nor have we gained sole knowledge of anything so that we must bring it to your attention. In no affair have we been assigned greater distinction than you. You have seen and heard the Messenger of God, you were one of his Companions and became a son-in-law to him. (Abu Bakr) b. Abi Quhafah was not better suited than you to act rightly, nor did (‘Umar) b. al-Khattab enjoy greater merit in any way, and indeed you had a closer blood relationship to the Messenger of God [than either of them]. You obtained a marriage tie to the Messenger of God such as they never did, nor did they have any precedence over you. Remember God! You are not being given your sight after you were blind, by God, nor are you being instructed after you were in ignorance. Verily the path is manifest and clear, and the signposts of true religion are standing upright. "Know, 'Uthman, that the best of God’s servants in His eyes is a just imam, one who has been guided aright and who himself gives right guidance, for he upholds accepted prescriptions and destroys rejected innovations. By God, everything is clear. Sound prescriptions stand I clearly marked, as do blameworthy innovations. The worst of men in God's sight is a tyrannical imam, one who has gone astray himself and by whom others are led astray, for he destroys an accepted prescription and revives a rejected innovation. Verily, I heard the Messenger of God say, .’The Day of Resurrection will be brought by the tyrannical imam, he will have no helper and no advocate, so that he will be cast into Hell, turning about in Hell as the mill turns, and then he will plunge into the fiery flood of Hell.' I tell you to beware of God and His sudden assault and His vengeance, for His punishment is harsh and painful indeed. I tell you to beware lest you be the murdered imam of this Community. Indeed it is said that an imam will be killed in this Community, and that bloody strife will be loosed upon it until the Day of Resurrection, and its affairs will become hopelessly entangled. (God) will leave them as sects, and they will not see the truth due to the great height of falsehood. They will toss therein like waves and wander in confusion."<br>Then ‘Uthman replied, "By God, I knew that (people) would be saying what you have said. But by God, if you were in my place I would not have berated you nor left you in the lurch nor shamed you nor behaved foully. If I have favored kinsmen, filled a need, sheltered an impoverished wretch, and appointed as governors men like those whom 'Umar used to appoint, then what have I done-wrong? I adjure you by God, O 'Ali, do you know that al- Mughirah b. Shu‘bah is not there?" "Yes," he answered. (Uthman) said, "Do you know that 'Umar made him a governor?"’ "Yes," he answered. Then ('Uthman said, "So why do you blame me for having appointed Ibn 'Amir, simply because of his close kinship [with me]?"<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 2);"><strong> <dfn><em>[Note:This is the biggest Lame Excuse by Muslims that 'Umar also made them Governors. But they totally conceal how 'Ali rejected this lame excuse by 'Uthman]</em></dfn></strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 2);"><strong>'</strong></span>Ali said, "I will tell you that everyone appointed by 'Umar b. al- Khattab was kept under close scrutiny by him.253 If (Umar) heard a single word concerning him he would flog him, then punish him with the utmost severity. But you do not do (that). You have been weak and easygoing with your relatives." "They are your relatives as well," answered Uthman. 'Ali said, "By my life, they are closely related to me indeed, but merit is found in others." Uthman said, "Do you know that Umar kept Mu'awiyah in office throughout his entire caliphate, and I have only done the same." 'Ali answered, "I adjure you by God, do you know that Mu'awiyah was more afraid of Umar than was Umar's own slave Yarfa’?" "Yes," said (Uthman). 'Ali went on, "In fact Mu'awiyah makes decisions on issues without (consulting) you, and you know it. Thus, he says to the people. ’This is Uthman's command.' You hear of this, but do not censure him." Then 'Ali left him, and Uthman went out on his heels. Then (Uthman) took his seat upon the pulpit and said, "To proceed: For everything there is some bane and in every situation there is some defect. The bane of this Community (ummah) and the defect in this (divinely bestowed) beneficence are the maligners and slanderers who let you see what is pleasing to you and conceal what is hateful to you. They talk and talk to you. Men who resemble ostriches follow the first one to make a noise. Their favorite watering place is the one far away, they fail to quench their thirst and they get only the sediment. No leader arises, affairs have worn them out, and they possess no means of gain." "By God, you have surely blamed me for things like those which you accepted from Ibn al-Khattab. But he trampled you underfoot, smote you with his hand, and subdued you by his tongue, and so you submitted to him whether you liked it or not. I have been lenient with you. I let you tread on my shoulders while I restrained my hand and tongue, and therefore you have been insolent toward me. By God, I am stronger [than he] in kinsmen, I have allies closer at hand, I possess more supporters. It is more fitting for me [than for him] to say 'Come!’ and have [men] come to me. I have appointed over you your peers. I have cheerfully lavished benefits upon you. But you have attributed to me a nature that I do not possess and statements that I have not uttered. Restrain your tongues and your slandering and maligning of your rulers, for I have kept from you a man who would satisfy you with less than these words of mine were he the one [now] speaking to you. Nay, but which of your rights are you deprived of? By God, I have achieved no less than did my predecessors or those about whose [standing in the Community] you have not disagreed. There is a surplus of wealth, so why should I not do as I wish with the surplus? Why otherwise did I become imam?"</p>

<p>Please keep in mind the following regarding this tradition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islamists frequently use the weak argument that Uthman’s governors were also in power during Umar's reign. However, they ignore how Ali Ibn Abi Talib countered this defense. Ali pointed out that under Umar, those same governors from the Banu Umayyah were kept in check by his strict governance, preventing corruption. In contrast, during Uthman's time, these governors became corrupt, and rather than addressing their misconduct, Uthman scolded those who complained about them.<hr></li>
</ul>
<p>After this first tradition, Ibn Jarir al-Tabari recorded several traditions from Saif Ibn Umar, who fabricated the story of Abdullah Ibn Saba. According to this false narrative: Ibn Saba, supposedly a Jew, promoted the idea that Ali was the rightful successor to Muhammad. Saif claimed Ibn Saba incited the people of Kufa and Basra against Uthman, wrote false letters, and even influenced prominent companions like Ammar Yasir and Abu Dhar. Unfortunately, these fabricated stories by Saif Ibn Umar form the basis of Islamist narratives. By using these false reports, Islamists have succeeded in creating one of the most significant propaganda stories in history: the idea that Uthman was not killed by Muslims, but by the Jewish Abdullah Ibn Saba and his followers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId722275"></a>Muawiyah Threatened the Companions of the Prophet</h2>
<p>The second narration, which is free from the accounts of Sayf ibn Umar, states:</p>
<blockquote>It was related to me by 'Abdallah b. Ahmad b. Shabbawayh-- his father – 'Abdallah--Ishaq b. Yahya-Musa b. Talhah: 'Uthman sent for Talhah, and I accompanied him. When he entered 'Uthman’s presence, there were 'Ali, Sa‘d (b. Abi Waqqas), al-Zubayr, 'Uthman, and Mu'awiyah. Mu'awiyah praised God and extolled Him as He merits, and then he said, "You are the Companions of the Messenger of God, the best (of His followers) on earth, and those charged with the affair s of this Community. No one other than you can hope for that (to become Caliph after 'Uthman). You have chosen your companion (as caliph) without compulsion or personal ambition. He has grown old and his life has passed by. If you had waited for decrepitude [to afflict] him, that would be near at hand. However, I hope that he has revered God so that He will allow him to reach that stage of life. Talk has spread, and I fear it for your sakes, for you have not denounced it in any way. You have my aid (in this matter). Do not inspire the people to long for your government, for by God, if they desire that, you will never see them do any-thing but tum tail and flee." 'Ali replied, "What is that to you, and what do you know about it? You have no mother!" (Mu'awiyah) said, "Leave my mother her place [in the Community]. She is not the worst of your mothers. She accepted Islam and swore fidelity to the Prophet. Now answer me in regard to what I am saying to you." Then 'Uthman said, "The son of my brother has spoken the truth. I will tell you in regard to myself and my conduct in office that my two predecessors (i.e. Abu Bakr and 'Umar) wronged both themselves and those who followed in their path.<dfn><em>[Note: 'Uthman starts blaming the previous two caliphs rather than accepting His own mistake. If He considered them to be on the wrong path, why didn't he say so during their lives? And why did He swore to follow their Sunnah when He was appointed as the caliph?]</em></dfn> Indeed the Messenger of God used to bestow (public funds) upon his relatives <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 2);"><strong><dfn><em>[Note: 'Uthman is indicating towards "KHUMS" and F'ay Money here, which Muhammad gave to his relatives]</em></dfn></strong></span>, while my near kinsmen were impoverished and possessed few of life’s necessities. Thus, I laid my hands on some of that wealth because of my concern for them. It was my opinion that (this wealth) was mine. Now if you regard that as an error, return (the money), my authority will be subject to yours." They replied, "You are right and have done well." They continued, "You gave (public funds) to ‘Abda11ah b. Khalid b. Asid and to Marwan," alleging that he had given Marwan 15,000 (dirhams) and Ibn Asid 50,000,<strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 2);"><dfn><em>[Note: If those relatives of Uthman were so Poor, why then 'Uthman didn't help them from his OWN MONEY? Instead of using own Money, 'Uthman gave them money from Bait-ul-Maal of Muslims. And this amount was huge and makes about 1 Million Dollars today]</em></dfn></span></strong> and they took (these sums) back from those two. They were satisfied with this and departed content.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Reference: History of Tabari, Vol.15, page 152</blockquote>
<p>Following facts are becoming clear from this Tradition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muawiyyah openly blamed grand Sahaba 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Talha, Zubair, Sa'ad bin Abi Waqas that they were inciting people against 'Uthman while they see their chances to become Caliph after 'Uthman.</li>
<li>'Uthman promised at time of taking Caliphate that he would follow the Sunnah of Sheikhain (i.e. Abu Bakr and 'Umar). But here he turned against his promise and blaming Sheikhain for making mistakes.</li>
<li>It was Allah who made that exception that Only Prophet (saw) and his relatives are given the share from Khums and F'ay Money.</li>
<li>But here 'Uthman is making this Khums and F'ay money Halal for his relatives.<hr> </li>
</ul>
<p>The next tradition again comes again from Saif Ibn-e-Umar in which Saif praises Muawiya for offering Uthman army and help &amp; Support. (Whereas, later another tradition is coming, which is much more authentic as it is free of Saif Ibn Umar, and which tells that Muawiya refused to help Uthman in time of need).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId958194"></a>The Contradictory Claim by Saif that Sabaies of Kufa and Basra wanted to see Talha and Zubair as Caliph</h2>
<p>Earlier Saif claimed that the Sabaies of Kufa and Basra used to consider 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib as Successor and WASI of Rasool (saw). But in next tradition this same Saif is accepting the truth that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The agitators from Basra wanted to see <strong>Talha</strong> as next Caliph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the agitators from Kufa wanted to see <strong>Zubair</strong> as next Caliph.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the question is, if Sabaies were the followers of 'Ali and considered him a GOD, why did then they want Talha or Zubair to be caliphs? The answer is simple, there were no Sabaies there, and it were companions of Muhammad who wanted Talha or Zubair to be caliphs instead of 'Uthman. </p>
<p>(In next traditions, Ibn Jarir Tabari recorded many times that only the Agitators from Egypt wanted to see 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib as next Caliph, while people of Basra and Kufa wanted Talha and Zubair as next Caliphs).</p>
<p>And that was the reason that 'Aisha didn't stay in Madina, but went to Basra in order to fight with 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib while people of Basra sided with Talha (and 'Aisha also wanted to see Talha as a caliph, which she absolutely hated Ali).</p>
<blockquote>Ibn-e-Jareer Tabari narrates from Ahmed bin Zubair, who narrates from his father, who narrates from Wahan bin Jarer, who narrates from Zahri :<br>After 4 months of death of 'Uthman, Talha and Zubair reached Macca. Abdallah ibn Amir had gathered a lot of people. All these people gathered in the presence of Ayesha and some suggested that they should go to Madina and fight against Ali while some said that they did not possess enough strength to fight Madinese. Eventually they all decided that they should go to Kufa or Basra while they were supporters of Talha and Zubair.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Reference: History of Tabari english edition vol:14 P; 43</blockquote>
<p>And there are numerous narrations stating that the people of Basra wanted Abu Musa Ashari to be their Caliph rather than Ali Ibn Abi Talib (See History of Tabari, events of year 33 and 34)</p>
<p>Other than these traditions from Saif Ibn Umar, there exists no other tradition (whose chain is free of Saif Ibn Umar) and which states that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The people of Kufa and Basra ever claimed the Direct Wilayah and Successorship of Ali Ibn Abi Talib.</li>
<li>That the people accused Uthman that he took over Ali's right of Immamate i.e. all those accusations made by Nasibies that the Shias were the one who killed Uthman since they considered Ali to be Muhammad's (saw) successor.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId936849"></a>Saif's claim that Whole Madina City fully supported 'Uthman</h2>
<p>In this next tradition, Saif tried to prove that 'Ali, Talha, Zubair (and all other Sahaba)… all of them fully supported 'Uthman during this period.</p>
<p>Then Saif is also making claim that M'uawiyyah sent Army to support 'Uthman (although another Tradition is coming next, which is free of Saif, and which tells that at that time M'uawiyyah turned his face from 'Uthman and didn't sent any help to him)</p>
<p>In this same tradition Saif also tells another lie that except for 2-3 people of Madina people (i.e. Ammar Yasir and Muhammad Ibn Abi Hudhayfa) all other companions of Muhammad and other people of Madina fully supported 'Uthman. However, all the traditions which are free of Saif ibn Umar, they tell exactly the opposite and they unanimously witness that Talha, Zubair, 'Aisha and whole Madina turned against 'Uthman and used to criticize him severely.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId906456"></a>Saif's claim that Ali Ibn Abi Talib sent Hassan (his son) to protect 'Uthman</h2>
<p>In this next tradition Saif claims that 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib sent Hassan (his son) to protect 'Uthman. However, it is difficult to believe in this claim of Said Ibn Umar as there are many other traditions which go against this tradition. For example, the book Akhbar-ul-Tawal is authentic historical book. On page 173 it is written:</p>
<blockquote>'Ali Ibn Abi Talib wrote a letter to M'uawiyah and wrote: I have got your letter in which you have blamed me that I left 'Uthman alone to be killed and that I incited people to kill him. I have not done any such thing. When people became angry upon caliph (i.e. 'Uthman) then some of them stopped supporting him while others killed him, while I limited myself only to my house and kept 'Uthman and his problems away from me.</blockquote>
<p>And if Hassan was really present there in order to protect 'Uthman, and he along with Marwan bin al-Hakam fighting with sword against the opponents, and he (Hassan) became filled with blood in doing so (as Saif claimed), then why this same Marwan bin al-Hakam later blamed 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib that he let 'Uthman to be killed?</p>
<p>Imam Muhammad bin Yahya ibn Bakr recorded:</p>
<blockquote>Marwan bin al-Hakam blamed 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib for the killing of 'Uthman and said to 'Ali: O 'Ali, even if you have not openly killed 'Uthman, but for sure you have killed him secretly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Reference: Book al-Tamheed by Muhammad bin Yahya, page 181</blockquote>
<p>How did then Marwan bin al-Hakam forget that 'Ali bin Abi Talibn sent his own son Hassan in order to protect 'Uthman, and according to Saif both Hassan and Marwan bin al-Hakam were fighting at door of 'Uthman's house and Hassan became full of blood while protecting 'Uthman?</p>
<p>Now for sake of argument, let us consider it to be the truth that 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib sent Hassan to protect 'Uthman. Still one thing is very much sure that the conclusion drawn from it is totally wrong, as it is very clear that 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib used to criticize severely upon the Innovations (Bidahs) of 'Uthman and wrong doings, and he got nose full of 'Uthman's attitude of making false promises again and again and then breaking them every time. And 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib thought that Marwan bin al-Hakam had converted 'Uthman into such an animal to whom he drove where ever he wanted.</p>
<p>That is why, even if 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib sent Hassan to protect 'Uthman, then it was not for the reason that he considered 'Uthman to be right or free of mistakes and innovations, but 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib didn't want any bloodbath in city of Madina and considered it against the interests of Muslim community.</p>
<p>There are tens of other Traditions which are unanimous that 'Ali was so much angry upon 'Uthman that he even stopped talking with him and he swore to not to involve between 'Uthman and his Opponents.</p>
<p>Similarly, you will read in next part of this article (the burrial of 'Uthman) that the dead body of 'Uthman was kept without coffin for 3 days in Madina and no Sahabah came to bury him. Neither 'Ali, nor Hassan participated in his bath and coffin and burial even after 3 days.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next few traditions have once again been quoted from Saif Ibn Umar by Ib Jarir Tabari, and they are telling the same fairy tales which are contradictory to all other traditions which are free of Saif Ibn 'Umar (like lies that all Sahaba were supporting 'Uthman etc.). In these traditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saif claimed that SABAIES wrote BRIEFS to Sahaba, inciting them against Uthman. </li>
<li>Saif claimed that 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib cursed the People of Egypt, Kufa and Basra who gathered there to demand their rights.(All tens of traditions which are free of Saif, they tell the contradictory that 'Ali always took side of agitators and always deemed them right and he always criticized 'Uthman that Marwan always misguided him and compelled him to break his promises.)</li>
<li>Saif's claim that Talha and Zubair also sent lanah upon the agitators and strongly supported 'Uthman (While traditions which are free of Saif, they tell us how Talha and Zubair played big role in assassination of 'Uthman and even didn't let water reach him for many days).</li>
</ul>
<p>The next tradition:</p>
<blockquote>Ibn Jarir recorded next traditions from al-Waqidi. Ibn Jarir Tabari writes:As for al-Waqidi, he has recounted many things conceming the reasons why the Egyptians went to Uthm an and made camp at Dhu Khushub. Among these are things that I have already men-tioned, a<strong>nd there are others that I have refused to mention because I find them offensive</strong>. Among his various accounts, (al-Waqidi) mentions that it was related to him by 'Abdallah b. Jafar——Abu 'Awn, the client of al-Miswar: ‘Amr b. al-'As had been Uthman’s governor (‘ami1) in Egypt. Then he stripped him of authority over the tax revenues (kharaj) and put him in charge of the public prayers. (Uthman) assigned authority over the tax revenues to 'Abdallah b. S'ad, and then combined both offices under 'Abdallah. When 'Amr b. al-As arrived in Medina, he launched vitriolic attacks upon Uthman. One day Uthman sent for him and met with him alone. He said, "Ibn al-Nabighah, how quickly the neckhole of your gown has become louse-ridden! You faithfully carried out your duties as govemor for a year previous [to this). Do you attack me, bearing one countenance in my presence and another in my absence? By God, were it not for a morsel of food [proffered you by my enemies), you would not do that. 'Amr replied, "Indeed much of what the people say and communicate to their rulers is falsehood. So fear God, O Commander of the Faithful, in regard to your subjects." Uthman said, "By God, I appointed you as governor inspite of your faults and all the talk about you." 'Amr responded, "I was governor on behalf of Umar b. al-Khattab, and at the time of his passing he was well satisfied with me."<br>Uthman said, "If I had controlled you as stringently as Umar did, by God, you would act rightly. But I have been lenient with you and so you have been insolent with me. By God, I possess greater glory than you through my next of kin in the Time of Ignorance and before I acquired my present authority." 'Amr replied, "Stop this! Praise be to God, who honored and guided us by Muhammad. I saw {my father] al-'Asi b. Wa’il and I saw your father 'Affan, and by God al-'As was nobler than your father!" Uthman was caught short and said, "Why should we be referring to the Time of Ignorance?" ‘Amr departed, and Marwan entered and said, "O Commander of the Faithful, you have come to a state of things where 'Amr b. al-'As can talk about your father!" Uthman replied, "Leave off! If a man mentions [other] men's fathers, they will mention his father." Thus, ‘Amr departed from Uthman filled with hatred for him. At one point he came to ‘Ali to incite him against Uthman. Then he approached al-Zubayr and Talhah in succession to incite them. He confronted the Pilgrimage caravan to inform them of Uthman’s wrongful innovations. When 'Uthman was besieged for the first time, (‘Amr) went from Medina until he reached a property that he owned in Palestine called al-Sab', and took up residence , in a castle of his named al-'Ajlan. He would say, "It is wonderful what we hear about Ibn 'Affan." While he was seated in that castle of his, with Salamah b. Rawh al-Judhami and his two sons Muhammad and 'Abdallah, a rider passed by them. 'Amr called out to him. "Where have you come from? " "Prom Medina," he answered. ('Amr) said, "What has that man done? ’»'-that is, Uthman. (The rider) said, "I left him tightly besieged." ‘Amr said, "I am Abu ‘Abdallah. Perhaps the jackass is breaking wind and the flatiron is in the fire."<br>('Amr) had not left his seat before a second rider passed by. ‘ Amr called out to him, "What has that man done? "that is, Uthman."He has been killed," he replied. ('Amr) said, "I am Abu 'Abdallah. When I rub a scab, I scrape it off?") I have been inciting [people] against him, even the shepherd on the mountaintop with his flock." Then Salamah b. Rawh said to him, "O leaders of Quraysh, verily there was a strong gate between you and the Arabs and you have broken it down. Whatever led you to do that?" ('Amr) said, "We wanted to draw the truth out of the pit of falsehood and to have the people be on an equal footing as regards the truth." ‘Uthman’s half—sister on his mother's side, Umm Kulthum bt. Uqbah b. Abi Mu'ayt, used to dwell with 'Amr, then he separated from her when Uthman deposed him.</blockquote>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId35397"></a>Ali Ibn Abi Talib complaining against the Companions of 'Uthman (Marwan b. al-Hakam, Sa'id b. al-'As, Ibn 'Amir, and Mu'awiyah)</h2>
<p>The next tradition is:</p>
<blockquote>According to Muhammad b. Umar (al-Waqidi)—'Abdallah b. Muhammad-his father: ... " When the dissidents established their camp at Dhu Khushub, the news spread that they intended to kill 'Uthman if he did not abdicate. At night their envoy came to 'Ali, Talhah, and 'Ammar b. Yasir successively. Muhammad b. Abi Hudhayfah had joined them in writing a letter to 'Ali, they brought this to 'Ali, but he did not examine its contents. When 'Uthman perceived all this, he came to 'Ali. He entered his house and said, "O cousin, nothing owed to me can be neglected, my kinship [with you] is close, and I have a strong claim upon your support. You see the trouble caused by this band of dissidents when they came to me today. I know that you enjoy prestige among the people and that they will listen to you. I want you to ride out to them and send them away from me. I do not wish them to come before me, for that would be an insolent act toward me on their part. Let others hear of this as well." 'Ali said, "On what grounds shall I send them away?" ('Uthman) replied, "On the grounds that I shall carry out what you have counseled me to do and thought right, and that I will not deviate from your direction." Then 'Ali said, "In fact I have spoken to you time after time, and you and I have discussed such matters at length. All this is the doing of Marwan b. al-Hakam, Sa'id b. al'As, Ibn 'Amir, and Mu'awiyah. You have heeded them and defied me." 'Uthman said, "Then I shall defy them and heed you."

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId427061"></a>'Uthman telling Lies during Khutba due to wicked advice of Marwan:</h2>
<p>The next tradition is:</p>
<blockquote>According to Muhammad b.'Umar (al-Waqidi)—'Abdallah b. Muhammad——his father: When 'Ali retumed to ‘Uthman, he informed him that they had gone and said to him some things which were on his mind. He said to him, "Know that I am saying more about you than I have said previously." Then he went home.'Uthman remained at home that day, until Marwan came to him the next day and said, "Speak and inform the people that the Egyptians have gone back, and that what they had heard about their imam was false. Your sermon (khutbah) will spread throughout the lands before the people can gather against you from their garrison towns [in such numbers] that you are unable to fend them off." 'Uthman refused to go out, but Marwan kept after him until he went forth and took his seat upon the pulpit. ('Uthman) praised and extolled God, and then said: "To proceed: As to this band of Egyptians, a certain matter concerning their imam had come to their attention. But when they were certain that what they had heard about was false they retumed to their own land." Then from one side of the mosque ‘Amr b. al'As called out to him: "Fear God, O 'Uthman, for you have borne great dangers, as we have done along with you. Turn to God, and we shall turn to Him!" 'Uthman shouted back, "So you are over there, Ibn al-Nabighah. By God, your robe has become louse-ridden since I removed you from office." From another direction someone else shouted, "Turn to God and show repentance. Then t the people will restrain themselves from you." 'Uthman stretched out his hands and turned to face the qiblah, saying, "O God, verily I am the first to repent." Then he went back to his house, while 'Amr b. al-'As proceeded to his residence in Palestine. ('Amr) used to say, "By God, if I were to run across a shepherd I would incite him against (Uthman)."</blockquote>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId429552"></a>'Ali's anger upon 'Uthman due to his 2<sup>nd</sup> breakage of Promise, and declaration of His irrelevance with 'Uthman's actions</h2>
<p>The next tradition is:</p>
<blockquote>According to Muhammad b. 'Umar (al-Waqidi)-—'Ali b. ‘Umar—-his father: 'Ali came to ‘Uthman after the Egyptians had gone and said to him: "Make a statement which the people will testify that they have heard from you, and God will be witness as to whether or not you desire to repent in your heart. The provinces are in turmoil against you, and I fear another company of riders may come from Kufah. You will say, ''Ali, ride out to meet them, but I cannot go out and get [them] to listen to any excuse. Still other riders will come from Basrah, and you will say, 'O 'Ali, ride out to meet them.' If I do not do that, you will think I have betrayed our bonds of kinship and belittled your claims [on me]." Thus, Uthman went out and preached the sermon in which he laid before the people his heartfelt desire to repent. He arose, praising and extolling God as He merits, and then said: "To proceed: By God, O people, if any one of you has censured [me], he has not done so for anything that is unknown to me. I have done nothing unknowingly. But my soul has raised vain hopes within me and lied to me, and my rectitude has slipped away from me. I heard the Messenger of God say, 'Let him who slips repent, and let him who errs turn back and not persist in his own ruin. Verily he who persists in tyranny is very far from the true path.' Now I am the first to take warning. I ask God's forgiveness for what I have done and I turn to Him. A man like me yearns to repent. When I step down [from the pulpit], let your notables (ashraf) come to me and inform me of their opinion. By God, if the truth turns me into a slave, then I shall tread the slave’s path, I shall humble myself like a slave, and I shall be like the bondsman. If he is held in servitude, `he shows patience, if he is set free, he is grateful. There is no escape from God save by returning to Him. The best men among you will not fail to draw near me. If my right hand refuses, then my left hand will surely obey me." Then the people had pity on him, and some among them wept. Sa‘id b. Zayd stood up before him and said, "O Commander of the Faithful, no one comes to you who does not support you. Fear God, in your soul fear God, and fulfill what you have said!" When 'Uthman descended [from the pulpit], he found Marwan (b. al-Hakam), Sa'id (b. al-'As), and a few of the Banu Umayyah at his home. They had not been present at the sermon, and when ('Uthman) took his seat, Marwan said, "O Commander of the Faithful, shall I speak or remain silent?" Then Na'ilah bt. al-Farafisah, 'Uthman’s wife from the Kalb tribe, said, "Nay, be silent, for they will kill him and accuse him of sin , he has made a public statement from which he cannot rightfully withdraw." Then Marwan came up to her and said, "What does this have to do with you? By God, your father died without knowing how to perform the ablutions correctly." "Go easy, Marwan," she re-sponded, "in mentioning our fathers. You speak lies about my absent father. Indeed your father cannot defend himself [against similar charges]. By God, were (your father) not ('Uthman's) uncle and would (the caliph) not be distressed, I would tell no lies in informing you about (your father)." Then Marwan turned away from her and said, "O Commander of the Faithful, shall I speak or be silent?" (‘Uthman) answered, "No, speak." Marwan said, "You are as dear to me as my father and my mother! By God, I wish that you had made this statement [before the people] while you were still strong and invincible, and that I had been the first to be satisfied by it and to aid [you] in fulfilling it. However, you have said these things when the girth has reached the two teats and the torrent has overflowed the hill tops and when a humiliated man has submitted to humiliation. By God, to persist in an error for which you must seek God’s forgiveness is better than to repent because you are afraid. If you so will, you may seek repentance without acknowledging error. The people have piled up at the gate against you like a mountain." 'Uthman said, "Go out and speak to them, for I am ashamed to do so." So Marwan went to the gate, where the people were clambering on top of one another. He said, "Why have you gathered here like looters? Your faces are deformed, and every man is holding the ear of his confederate! Whom are you after? You have come to snatch our power from us. Go! By God, if you mean us [any harm], you will encounter something distasteful from us, and you will not praise the result of your opinions. Return to your homes, for by God we are not men to be robbed of our possessions." The people retreated, and one of them went to see 'Ali and informed him of the news. Then 'Ali came in a rage to 'Uthman and said, "Surely you have satisfied Marwan, but he is satisfied with you only if you deviate from your religion and reason, like a camel carrying a litter that is led around at will. By God, Marwan is devoid of sense in regard to his religion and his soul. I swear by God, I think he will bring you in and then not send you out again. After this visit I will not come again to chide you. You have destroyed your own honor and you have been robbed of your authority." When 'Ali departed, ('Uthman’s) wife Na'ilah bt. al—Farafisah entered and said, "Shall I speak or remain silent?" "Speak, " he replied. She said, "I have heard what 'Ali said to you, that he will not retum to you, and that you have obeyed Marwan, who leads you wherever he wishes." ('Uthman] said, "What shall I do?" She responded, "You should fear God alone, Who has no partner, and you should adhere to the practice of your two predecessors [namely, Abu Bakr and 'Umar]. For if you obey Marwan he will kill you. Marwan enjoys no prestige among the people and inspires neither awe nor love. The people have only abandoned you due to Marwan’s place [in your councils]. Send to 'Ali, then, and trust in his honesty and uprightness. He is related to you, and he is not a man whom people disobey." So Uthman sent to 'Ali, but he refused to come, saying, "I told him I would not retum." Having learned of Na’ilah’s comments about him, Marwan came to 'Uthman and took a seat before him. He said, "Shall I speak or remain silent?" "Speak," replied (Uthman). (Marwan) began, "The daughter of al-Farafisah .... " Uthman said, "You are not to say a thing about her! How evil is your countenance! By God, she is a better adviser to me than you are." With this Marwan desisted.</blockquote>

<p>The next tradition is:</p>
<blockquote>According to Muhammad b. Umar (al-Waqid‘i]—-Shurahbil b. Abi 'Awn—-his father: I heard 'Abd al-Rahman b. al—Aswad b. 'Abd Yaghuth mention Marwan b. al-Hakam. He said: May God disfigure Marwan! Uthman went out to the people and gave them satisfaction. He wept as he stood on the pulpit, and the people wept also, until I saw his beard soaked with tears. He was saying, "O God, I tum to Thee in repentance. O God, I repent, I repent! By God, if it is right for me to become a mere slave, I will be content with that. When I enter my house, all of you come before me, and by God I will not seclude myself from you. On the contrary, I will give you satisfaction in full measure and more, and I will send Marwan and his kin away." When (Uthman] entered [his house], he commanded that the gate be thrown open. When he went into his house, Marwan came to him and worked ceaselessly to delude him, until at last he beguiled him from his better judgment and eradicated his original intentions. For three days Uthman stayed inside and would not go out, for he was ashamed to face the people. Then Marwan went out to the people and said, "May your faces be deformed! Whom are you after? Go back to your homes. If the Commander of the Faithful needs any of you, he will send for him. Otherwise, he will remain in his house." 'Abd al-Rahman continues: So I came to 'Ali, and found him [in the mosque] between the Prophet’s grave and the pulpit. With him were 'Ammar b. Yasir and Muhammad b. Abi Bakr, and they were saying, "Marwan has acted badly toward the people." 'Ali came over to me and asked, "Were you present at 'Uthman's sermon?" "Yes," I said. 'Ali went on, "And were you present when Marwan spoke to the people?" "Yes," I answered. 'Ali said, "God forbid, O Muslims, that if I remain in my house, he should accuse me of abandoning him in spite of his kinship [with me] and his rights. And God forbid that if I speak [to him] and things turn out as he desires, Marwan would trick him3 and he would become like a captured beast driven by al-Marwan at will [all this] despite his advanced age and his having been a Companion of the Messenger of God." 'Abd al-Rahman b. al-Aswad continues: ,('Ali) kept on until 'Uthman's envoy arrived and said, "Come with me." 'Ali responded in a loud, angry voice, " Tell him that I will not come before him again." The messenger departed. I tried without success to meet with 'Uthman two nights later. I asked his servant where the Commander of the Faithful had been, and he said, "He was with 'Ali." ‘Abd al-Rahman b. al-Aswad continues: So I took my leave and paid a visit to 'Ali. He said to me, "'Uthman came to me yesterday and began to accuse me of refusing to see him again and of working [against him]. So I said to him, ’After what you said on the pulpit of the Messenger of God, and after [the promises] you gave of your own free will, you entered your house, and Marwan went out before the people, reviling and insulting them at your gate.('Uthman) responded, saying, ’You have severed the bonds of kinship with me. You have abandoned me and emboldened the people against me.' I [that is, 'Ali] replied, 'By God, I am your strongest defender against the people. But whenever `I have brought to you any matter that I think you will find agreeable, (Marwan) brings another. You have heard Marwan speak against me and have invited him to enter your presence.' " Then he left and went home.'Abd al-Rahman b. al-Aswad continues: I constantly saw 'Ali avoiding ('Uthman) and not acting as he formerly had. However, I know that he spoke with Talhah when ('Uthman) was under siege, to the effect that water skins should be taken to him. ('Ali) was extremely upset about that, until at last water skins were brought in to "Uthman.</blockquote>

<p>Affter that Ibn Jarir Tabari recorded 5 small traditions which are telling that some people of Madina like Jibla bin Amr al-Saidi, Amr bin al-'Aas and Jajha Ghafari used to abuse 'Uthman openly in front of whole Madina and none of them stopped them.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId268894"></a>Sahaba of Madina killed 'Uthman. And 'Uthman's decisive plan to kill the people of Egypt, and the insurrection of people of Madina</h2>
<p>The next tradition is:</p>
<blockquote>It was related to me by ]a'far b. 'Abdallah al—Muhammadi— ‘Amr — Muhammad b. Ishaq b. Yasar al-Madani — his paternal uncle 'Abd al-Rahman b.Yasar: When the people saw what 'Uthman was doing, the Companions of the Prophet in Medina wrote to the Companions who were scattered throughout the frontier provinces: "You have gone forth but to struggle in the path of Almighty God, for the sake of Muhammad's religion. In your absence the religion of Muhammad has been corrupted and forsaken. Come then and reestablish Muhammad's religion." Thus, they came from every direction until they killed ('Uthman). When the people turned around to go back after 'Uthman claimed he had repented, he wrote a letter to 'Abdallah b. Sa‘d b. Abi Sarh, his governor in Egypt, concerning those who had come from Egypt, for they were the most hostile to him of all the ` provincial garrisons: "To proceed: Look for so andso and so and so, and behead them if they come to you. Look also for certain other men, and punish them in such and such a way." These persons included a few of the Companions of the Messenger of God as well as a body of the Successors. His envoy on this occasion was Abu al-A'war b. Sufyan al-Sulami. 'Uthman mounted him on one of his camels and ordered him to get to Egypt before the dissidents arrived. Abu al-A'war overtook the Egyptians along the road, and they asked him where he was going. "To Egypt," he replied, and he was accompanied by a Syrian from Khawlan. When they saw him on 'Uthman’s camel, they said, "Are you carrying a letter?" "No," he said. "Why were you sent," they asked. "I don’t know," he responded. "You are not carrying a letter," they said, "and you do not know why you were sent.`Your situation is suspicious." Then they searched him and found a letter in an empty water skin. Upon examining the letter, they discovered that some of them were to be executed and others were to be punished in their persons and property. When they saw this they returned to Medina. The people learned about their return and what had happened to them. They came back from all the provinces, and the Medinese rose up in rebellion.</blockquote>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId22728"></a>'Uthman's order to Muawiya to send the Army and Muawiya's insurrection</h2>
<p>The next tradition is:</p>
<blockquote>In next tradition Ibn Jarir Tabari writes that it was related to me by ]a'far—‘Amr and ‘Ali—— Husayn—his father—Muhammad b. Sa'ib a1—Kalbi: The Egyptians returned to 'Uthman after having departed from him because a slave of his, riding one of his camels, overtook them carrying a letter to the governor of Egypt [with orders] to kill some of them and crucify others. When they came back to 'Uthman they said, "This is your slave." He said, "My slave went without my knowledge." They said, "[It is] your camel." He responded, "He took it from the house without my orders." They said, "[This is] your seal." "It was forged," he said. . » When the Egyptians arrived, 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Udays al-Tujibi and said: They came from Bilbays and Upper Egypt, long-necked, their eyes squinting like bows, Their flanks covered in chain mail. They demand God’s due from al-Walid, from 'Uthman and from Sa'id. O Lord, send us back with what we seek! When 'Uthman saw what had happened to him and how many of the people had been sent against him, he wrote Mu'awiyah b. Abi Sufyan in Syria: "In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. To proceed: The Medinese have become unbelievers , they have abandoned obedience and renounced their oath of allegiance. Therefore send to me the Syrian soldiers who are at your disposal, on every camel you have, whether docile or stubborn." When Mu'awiyah got the letter, he delayed action on it, for he did not wish to differ openly with the Companions of the Messenger of God, since he knew that they concurred [on this matter]. When 'Uthman became aware of the delay, he wrote to seek aid from other provinces... (The armies came from other provinces but when the people made camp at al-Rabadhah—the vanguard having located in a district of Medina named Sirar—they learned of ‘Uthman’s murder and thus they returned form there).</blockquote>
<p>So, Muawiyah denied to send army to help Uthman. Later, Muawiya's demand for justice (for the murder of 'Uthman) was only a Drama, which he did in order to get support against 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib in the war.</p>
<blockquote>Ibn-e-Jareer Tabari narrates from Ibn-e-Abbas: Ibne 'Abbas said to 'Ali that Muawiya is a worldly person with materialistic desires and if you let him be the governor of Syria, he will forget the murder of 'Uthman and will favour you. (History of Tabari, english edition, vol:1, P;23)</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId856855"></a>'Uthman once again trying to decieve people of Egypt, and trying to gather Army against them</h2>
<p>In next tradition Ibn Jarir Tabari writes:</p>
<blockquote>It was related to me by ]a'far—‘Amr and 'Ali—Husayn — his father — Muhammad b. Ishaq b. Yasar al-Madani — Yahya b. 'Abbad b. 'Abdal1ah b. Al-Zubayr — his father: The Egyptians in al-Suqya or Dhu Khushub wrote a letter to 'Uthman. One of them brought it to 'Uthman, who did not reply in any way, but ordered him to be ejected from the house. Then six hundred Egyptians marched on ‘Uthman. They were divided into four brigades, and the commander of each carried a banner. The overall command was in the hands of ‘Amr b. Budayl b. Warqa’ al-Khuza'i, one of the Companions of the Prophet, and 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Udays al-Tujibi (another Companion who participated in bait-e-Ridhwan too). Their letter to ('Uthman) contained [the following statements]: "In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. To proceed: Know that ’God changes not what is in a people, until The Events of the Year 35 they change what is in themselves. So fear God, fear God! You are in a transitory world, and you must seek its fulfillment in a world to come. Do not forget your share in the world to come, and be not tempted by this present life. Know, by God, that we have been angered for God’s sake, and that we find satisfaction in God. Know that we will not remove our swords from our shoulders until you come to us either with frank and unambiguous repentance or with outright falsehood. This is our statement to you, and this is our case against you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>God will excuse us for our actions against you. Peace." The Medinese wrote to 'Uthman, calling on him to repent, and swearing by God that they would not desist until they killed him or he fulfilled his God ordained obligations to them. When (Uthman) feared he would be killed, he consulted his advisers and the members of his family and said, "You see what the dissidents (qawm) have done. What is the way out?" They counseled him to send for 'Ali b. Abi Talib and to ask him to turn the people away by granting their requests in order to stall them until reinforcements could get to him. 'Uthman replied, "The dissidents will not be put off. My promises were empty and I did nothing the first time they came. If I give them my promise again they will demand that I fulfill it." Marwan b. al-Hakam said, "O Commander of the Faithful, dealing discreetly with them until you gain strength is preferable to struggling with them at close range. Give them what they ask and put them off so long as they delay in regard to you. They rebelled against you, so they possess no binding commitment [from you]." 'Uthman sent for 'Ali, and when 'Ali arrived he said to him, "Abu Hasan, you see what the people have done and you know what I have done. I fear they may kill me. Send them away from me, and I swear to God that I shall requite them for everything they detest, and I will grant them justice against me or anyone else, even if my own blood be shed thereby." 'Ali said, "The people desire your justice more than your death. I see a band of men (qawm) who will be content only with full satisfaction. When they first came to you, you gave them your promise in God's name that you would turn back from everything that they denounced, and thus you (were able to) send them away. Then A you failed to carry out any of that. Do not tempt me with any thing this time, for I will give them justice against you." "Yes," said Uthman. "Give them justice, and by God I will carry it out in full." · So 'Ali went out to the people and said, "O people, you have demanded justice and (now) it is granted to you. 'Uthman claims that he will do you justice, whether it be against himself or any one else, and that he will abandon everything that you detest. Accept this from him and affirm it." The people answered, "We accept it. Make a compact with him for us, for by God, we will not be content with words instead of deeds." 'Ali said to them, "You will have it." Then he entered ‘Uthman’s presence and told . him the news. Uthman said, "Arrange a delay between them and me so that I will have time to act, for I cannot do away with the things they detest in one day." ‘Ali responded, "There can be no delay con ceming matters here in Medina. As to matters elsewhere, you may delay as long as it takes your orders to get there." Uthman said, "All right, but give me a delay of three days for affairs in Medina." 'Ali agreed. Then he went to the people and informed them of this. He wrote out a document between (the people) and Uthman that gave him a three-day grace period to do away with every injustice and remove every govemor whom they disliked. Then he bound him in this document as tightly as God had ever bound one of His creatures by compact or covenant. ('Ali) had (the document) witnessed by a body of the leading Emigrants and Helpers. Thus, the people turned back from (Uthman) and withdrew until he should fulfill the promises that he had freely given them. But (Uthman) began preparing for war and gathering arms. He had already formed a strong army from among the slaves acquired as part of the caliph's one-fifth share (i.e. Khums Money)." When the three days had passed and he had done nothing to alter anything which was hateful to the people or to remove any governor, they revolted against him. 'Amr b. Hazm al—Ansari went out to the Egyptians in Dhu Khushub and informed them of the situation. He proceeded with them to Medina, where they sent to 'Uthman and said, "Did we not leave you when you claimed that you had repented of your unlawful innovations (ahdath) and tumed away from things hateful to us? Have you not given us a compact and covenant before God?" He answered, "I have indeed, and I hold to that." Then (‘Amr b. Hazm) said, "So what is this letter that we found in the possession of your messenger, written by you to your governor?" (Uthman) responded, "I did not write it, and I don't know what you are talking about." They said, "It was your messenger on your camel, a letter (written) by your secretary and bearing your seal!(Uthman) replied, "As for the camel, it was stolen. (One man’s) handwriting may resemble (another's). As to the seal, it was forged." They said, "We will not act precipitously even though we suspect you. Remove from us your sinful governors and appoint others over us who are not accused (of taking) our lives and property. Respond to our grievances." Uthman said, "How do I look if I name officials whom you desire and remove those hateful to you? Authority (a1—amr) would then belong to you." They said, "By God, you must either do (what you promised), abdicate, or be killed. See to things yourself or leave (them to us)." But he refused, saying, "I am not one to remove a robe that God has placed upon me." So they besieged him for forty nights, and in the mean time Talhah led the people in worship.</blockquote>
<p>Thus, this tradition proves that:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Uthman wanted to kill the opponents and thus he sent letters to his relatives to send the army.</li>
<li>In order to achieve his aim, he deceived 'Ali and asked him to let the opponents know that this time, he will consider their complaints.</li>
<li>He asked to allow him three days time, the purpose of which was to gather the army. He also used the income of Bait-ul-Maal to buy slaves and create his army.</li>
<li>When the people of Egypt enquired of his letter (a plot to kill them), he cleverly refused all things that the Slve went without his order, don't know who gave his camel to that slave, don't know who wrote that letter in his name and in writing of his writer, and don't know from where came his SEAL upon that letter, ...etc.</li>
<li>And to be honest, the Muslims of Egypt had good intentions because they still said that they did not want to kill him. They just wanted him to consider their demands. But 'Uthman refused and remained busy to plot their murder.</li>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId33790"></a>Malik Asthar and the Murder of 'Uthman at the hands of Muhamad Bin Abi Bakr</h2>
<p>In the next tradition, Ibn Jarir Tabari writes:</p>
<blockquote>It was related to me by Ya'qub b. Ibrahim - Isma'il b. Ibrahim- Ibn 'Awn-al-Hasan - Waththab. According to (al-Hasan): (Waththab) was one of those manumitted by the Commander of the Faithful Umar, and I saw on his throat the scars of two stab wounds, like a pair of leather thongs, which he had suffered on the Day of the House. According to (Waththab): 'Uthman sent me to summon al-Ashtar and he came . The Crisis of the Early Caliphate Ibn 'Awn thinks that Waththab went on as follows: I laid down a cushion for the Commander of the Faithful and another for (al-Ashtar). Then (Uthman) said, "Ashtar, what do the people want from me? " "You cannot avoid doing one of three things," he said. "What are they?" asked (Uthman). (Al-Ashtar) said, "They ask you to choose between (the following). You may turn their affairs over to them and say, 'This is your affair, choose whomever you will for it.' Second, you may have yourself punished. If you reject these two choices, then this band of men (qawm) will kill you." (Uthman) replied, "As for my turning their affairs over to them, I am not one to remove a robe that Almighty God has placed upon. ..." Al-Ashtar rose and hurried away, while we remained there for some days. Then a little man came like a wolf, peered in through the door, and then left. Muhammad b. Abi Bakr came with thirteen men and went up to 'Uthman. He seized his beard and shook it until I heard his teeth chattering. (Muhammad b. Abi Bakr) said, "Mu'awiyah was no help to you, nor was Ibn 'Amir nor your letters."</blockquote>
<blockquote>(Uthman) said, "Let go of my beard, son of my brother! Let go of my beard!" Then I saw (Ibn Abi Bakr) signaling with his eye to one of the rebels (qawm). He came over to him with a broad iron-headed arrow and stabbed him in the head with it. I [that is, Ibn 'Awn] asked, "Then what happened?" (Waththab) replied, "They gathered round him and killed him."</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our comments:</strong> Once again Muawiyyah has been exposed here. But Muslims have been putting the whole blame upon poor Jews (i.e. the forefathers of Shias according to their fabricated lies) who had nothing to do with it. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId845640"></a>Muhammad bin Muslima's attestation and 'Uthman's attempt to decieve the people of Egypt</h2>
<p>In the next tradition, Ibn Jarir Tabari writes:</p>
<blockquote>According to al-Waqidi-Yahya b. 'Abd al-'Aziz- Ja'far b. Mahmud - Muhammad b. Maslamah: I set out with a band of my fellow tribesmen to meet the Egyptians. They were led by four chiefs: 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Udays a al-Balawi, Sudan b. Humran al—Muradi, 'Amr b. al-Hamiq al-Khuza'i — whose name became so dominant that (the force) was called "the army of Ibn al-Hamiq — and Ibn al-Niba'. I entered their presence as the four of them were in a tent, and I saw that the people were following them. I stressed ‘Uthman’s rights and the oath of allegiance that lay upon their necks. I filled them with a dread of civil war (fitnah), and informed them that ('Uthman's) murder was a grave matter, concerning which there was much dissension. "Do not be the first to open the gate of discord. He will turn away from those practices for which you have criticized him, and I will be the guarantor of that." The dissidents said, "And what if he does not desist?" I answered, "Then the matter is up to you." They went away satisfied, and I retumed to 'Uthman and said, "Grant me a private audience." He did so. I said, "Fear God, ‘Uthman, fear God for your life! Verily these people have only come seeking your blood, and you see how your associates have abandoned you. Worse, they are going over to your enemy." He expressed his consent and asked God to requite me. Then I departed from him, but remained [in Medina] so long as God willed. 'Uthman had spoken [to me] about the Egyptians' retum [to Dhu Khushub], he mentioned that they had come for one thing but had obtained something else and then departed. I wanted to come and rebuke him, but I kept silent. Suddenly someone said, "The Egyptians have arrived and are in al-Suwayda’." I said, "Is it true, what you say?" "Yes," he replied.‘Uthman sent to me, for the news had reached him, and the dissidents (qawm) had made camp in Dhu Khushub at that very mo-ment. (Uthman) said, "Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, these dissidents have returned. What should be done about them?" I responded, "By God, I do not know, but I do not think they have come back for any good purpose." (Uthman) said, "Go out to them and send them away." "No, by God, I will not," I said. "Why?" he asked. I said, "Because I assured them that you would desist from certain matters, and you have not desisted from a single letter of them." He said, "God is the one whose aid we seek." I went out, while the dissidents came and established themselves in al-Aswaf and laid siege to 'Uthman. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Udays came to me, accompanied by Sudan b. Humran and his two comrades. They said, "Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, do you not know that you spoke to us and sent us away? And you claimed that our companion (that is, 'Uthman] would cease his reprehensible acts?" "Yes indeed," I said. Then they showed a short letter to me, there was a lead tube, and they were saying, "We found one of the alms-tax camels being ridden by Uthman's slave. We seized his belongings and searched him, and we found this letter on him. It contains the following: 'In the name of Cod, the Merciful, the Compassionate. To proceed: If 'Abd al-Rahman b. Udays comes to you, give him a hundred lashes. Shave his head and beard, and keep him in confinement until my orders reach you. Do the same with ‘Amr b. al-Hamiq, Sudan b. Humran, and Urwah b. al·Niba' al-Laythi.’ " I said, "How do you know that Uthman wrote this?" They responded, "Suppose Marwan has done this without Uthman's knowledge. That would be worse, and he must remove himself from office." They added, "Hurry to him with us. We have spoken to ‘Ali, and he has promised us that he will speak with him at the noon prayer." We came to Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas, but he said, "I will not intervene in your affair." We came to Sa'id b. Zayd b. ‘Amr b. Nufayl, and he said the same thing. Muhammad (b. Maslamah) asked, "Where did ‘Ali promise you (he would act]?" "He promised us that he would go and see (Uthman) at the noon prayer," they answered. ( According to Muhammad (b. Maslamah): I performed the prayer with ‘Ali, then he and I entered (Uthman's) presence and said, "These Egyptians are at the door, so give them leave (to come in]." Now Marwan was sitting with him, and he said, "May I be thy ransom. Permit me to speak to them." Uthman responded, "May God leave you open mouthed! Get away from me. You have nothing to say about this matter." So Marwan went out, and ‘Ali came in to see him. The Egyptians had told him what they had told me, and 'Ali began to inform ('Uthman) what they had discovered in the letter. (Uthman) started to swear by God that he had not written or known about or sought advice conceming (this letter). Muhammad b. Maslamah [that is, the narrator of this incident] said, "By God he is telling the truth. This is Mar-wan’s doing.'? 'Ali said, "Then have them come in and hear your excuse." ‘Uthman went up to ‘Ali and said, "We are kinsmen through the female lineage. ” By God, if you were in this situation I would extricate you from it. Go out and speak to them, for they will listen to you." But 'Ali replied, "I will not do it. Rather, have them enter so that you may present your excuses to them." (Uthman) said, "Have them come in." According to Muhammad b. Maslamah: (So at that point they entered, but they did not give him the greeting appropriate to a caliph. Then I knew that this was evil itself. We exchanged the usual greetings, rand then Ibn Udays stepped forward as spokesman for the dissidents. He mentioned what Ibn Sa‘d had done in Egypt, recalling his unjust treatment of the Muslims and the protected peoples, and noting his appropriation of the Mus-lims' booty for himself alone. And when he was told about that, he said, "These are the written orders of the Commander of the Faithful." Then they mentioned innovations which (Uthman) had instituted in Medina——things opposed by his two predecessors. · (Ibn Udays) said, "We journeyed from Egypt seeking nothing but your blood or an end [to these abuses], but ‘Ali and Muhammad b. Maslamah sent us back, and Muhammad assured us that everything we had complained about would be ended." Then they turned toward Muhammad b. Maslamah and asked, "Did you tell us that?" According to Muhammad, "I said that I had." [Ibn ,Udays continued:) "Then we returned to our country, calling upon Almighty God for help against you, because we had over-whelming proof [for our claims]. Then when we were in al-Buwayb, we apprehended your slave and seized the letter under your seal to 'Abdallah b. Sa'd, in which you order him to flog us, to disfigure us by cutting off our hair, and to imprison us for long terms. Here is your letter." 'Uthman praised and extolled God. Then he said, "By God I did not write it, I did not order it [to be written], I did not take counsel about it, I did not_know about it. According to Muhammad (b. Maslamah): 'Ali and I both said, "He is telling the truth." 'Uthman was relieved at this. The Egyptians asked, "So who wrote it?" ('Uthman) responded, "I don't know." (Ibn 'Udays) continued, ”Can anyone treat you so audaciously that your slave is sent on a camel paid by the Muslims as alms tax, your seal is forged, and your govemor is written to concerning these grave matters, while you know nothing?" "Yes," he replied. They said, "A man like you should not govern. Remove yourself from this office (amr), as God has removed you from it." ('Uthman] replied, "I shall not remove a shirt that Al-mighty God has placed upon me." The shouting and noise grew louder, and I [that is, the narrator, Muhammad b. Maslamah] thought that they would not leave without attacking him. Then 'Ali arose and went out, and when he stood up I did the same. He told the Egyptians to go and they did so. 'Ali and I each retumed to our own homes, but they broke off their siege of ('Uthman) only when they had killed him.</blockquote>
<p>The next tradition is again from Muhammad bin Musaylmah and almost the same as above.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId603569"></a>Marwan blaming Saad bin Abi Waqas for participating in the plot against 'Uthman</h2>
<p>In next tradition Ibn Jarir Tabari writes:</p>
<blockquote>According to Muhammad b.'Umar [al-Waqidi] — Muhammad b. Muslim - Musa b. 'Uqbah —— Abu Habibah: On the day 'Uthman was killed, I saw Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas go in to him. Then he came out, saying "To God we belong and to Him we shall retum," on account of what he saw at (‘Uthman’s) door. Marwan said to him, "Now you are sorry, but you have slain him." I [that is, the narrator Abu Habibah] heard Sa'd say, "I beg God’s forgiveness. I did not imagine that the people would dare to demand his blood. I came before him just now, and he made a statement that neither you nor your comrades heard. He renounced all his reprehensible actions and manifested repentance. He said, ’I will not keep on toward ruin, for he who persists in tyranny is very far from the [true] path. I shall repent and desist from evil.' " Marwan said, "If you mean to defend (Uthman), you must get Ibn Abi Talib, but he has secluded himself and will not be spoken to." Sa'd left and went to ‘Ali, who was [in the mosque] between the [Prophet's] tomb and the pulpit. He said, "Get up, Abu Hasan. May my father and mother be your ransom. By God, I bring you the best news anyone has ever received. Take care of your cousin, deal kindly with him, spare his blood, and the situation will again be as we desire. Your caliph has given [us] satisfaction of his own free will." 'Ali responded, "May God hear him, Abu Ishaq. By God, I have persisted in defending him until I am filled with shame. But Marwan, Mu'awiyah, 'Abdallah b. 'Amir, and Sa'id b. al-'As have dealt with him as you see. When I gave him sincere counsel and directed him to send them away, he became suspicious of me, until what you now see has happened." While (Sa'd and 'Ali) were thus engaged, Muhammad b. Abi Bakr came and whispered to 'Ali. Then 'Ali took my hand and arose, saying, "What good is his repentance now?" And by God, I [that is, the narrator Abu Habibah] no sooner reached my house than I heard the cry that 'Uthman had been killed.</blockquote>
<p>Next two traditions are about how People came from Egypt and gathered around Madina.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId348982"></a>Talha's Role in Killing of 'Uthman</h2>
<p>In next tradition Ibn Jariri Tabari writes:</p>
<blockquote>According to Muhammad (b. Umar al-Waqidi)—Ibrahim b. Sa-lim—his father—Busr b. Sa'id———‘Abdallah b. 'Ayyash b. Abi Rabi‘ah: I entered 'Uthman’s presence and talked with him for an hour. He said, "Come, Ibn 'Ayyash," and he took me by the hand and had me listen to what the people at his door were saying. We heard some say, "What are you waiting for," while others were saying, "Wait, perhaps he will repent." While the two of us were standing there, Talhah b. Ubaydallah passed by, he stopped and said, "Where is Ibn Udays? " He was told, "He is over there." Ibn Udays came over to (Talhah) and whispered some-thing to him, then he went back to his comrades and said, "Do not let anyone go in to see this man or leave his house." Uthman said to me, "These are Talhab b. Ubaydallab’s orders." He continued: "O God, protect me from Talhah b. Ubaydallah, for he has incited all these people against me. By God, I hope nothing will come of it and that his blood will be shed. He has abused me unlawfully. I heard the Messenger of God say, ’The blood of a Muslim is lawful only in three cases: a man who disbelieves after having professed Islam is put to death, a man who commits adultery is stoned, a man who kills except in legitimate retaliation for another is put to death. So why should I be killed?" Then 'Uthman went back [into the house]. According to Ibn 'Ayyash: I wanted to leave, but they blocked my path until Muhammad b. Abi Bakr passed by and said, "Let him go." They did so.</blockquote>
<p>In next tradition again Ibn Jarir Tabari is writing about Talha that:</p>
<blockquote>According to Muhammad (b. 'Umar al-Waqidi]-Ya'qub b. 'Abdallah al-Ash‘ari—-]a'far b. Abi al-Mughirah—-Sa'id b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abzay-his father: I witnessed the day they went in against 'Uthman. They entered the house through an opening in the residence of 'Amr b. Hazm. There was some skirmishing and then they got in. By God, I have not forgotten that Sudan b. Humran came out and I heard him say, "Where is Talhah b. 'Ubaydallah? We have killed Ibn 'Affan!"</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId43700"></a>Followers of 'Uthman started the feud</h2>
<p>In next tradition Ibn Jarir Tabari records:</p>
<blockquote>According to Muhammad b. ‘Umar (al-Waqidi)-Shurahbil b. Abi ‘Awn-his father-—Abu Hafsah al-Yamani: I used to belong to a Bedouin. Marwan liked me and purchased me along with my wife and son, and then freed us all. I used to accompany him. When ‘Uthman was put under siege, the Banu Umayyah prepared to defend him, and Marwan entered the ]caliph’s] residence [and stayed] with him. I too was there. By God, I initiated the fighting among the people by throwing [a stone] from the roof of the house at a man of [the tribe of] Aslam named Niyar and killed him. Then fighting broke out and I descended. The people battled at A the door, and Marwan fought until he fell down. I carried him off and brought him into the house of an old woman and locked him in. ...</blockquote>
<p>Next tradition is once again from 'Umar (al-Waqidi) and is same as above</p>
<p>Next tradition is about 'Abd al-Rehman ibn 'Udays how he attacked at house of 'Uthman.</p>
<p>In next tradition, Ibn Jarir Tabari records:</p>
<blockquote>It was related to me by Ja'far b. ‘Abdal1ah al-Muhammadi— ‘Amr b. Hammad and ‘Ali b. Husayn—Husayn b. 'Isa——his father: When the three days following the Feast of Sacrifice had passed (therebels) surrounded 'Uthman’s house, but he insisted on retaining his office, and sent to assemble his retainers and close associates. One of the Prophet’s Companions, a venerable old man named Niyar b. 'Iyad (He is a companion who didn't come from Egypt but he was from Madina), arose and called out, "'Uthman!" (‘Uthman) looked down at him from the roof of his house. (Niyar) reminded him of God and implored him in God’s name to dissociate himself from (his evil associates). And while he was speaking, one of 'Uthman’s associates shot and killed him with an arrow. ('Uthman’s opponents) claimed that the man who shot him was Kathir b. al-Salt al-Kindi, and at this they said to 'Uthman, "Turn the murderer of Niyar b. 'Iyad over to us that we may kill him in retaliation." He replied, "I will not kill a man who has defended me while you intend to murder me.</blockquote>
<p>Please note neither there was any worth of blood of this companion of Muhammad in eyes of Uthman, nor in eyes of Muslim. But for them, if there is Qasas of any Blood, then it is only of the blood of Uthman.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the intention of Egyptians was not to kill 'Uthman. It was rather to correct him. They gave him a number of chances. And 'Uthman kept on making false promises &amp; conspiring against the &amp; writing letters to plan the massacre of Egyptians.</p>
<p>The next four traditions of Tabari describe, how they entered 'Uthman's house and killed Him.</p>
<hr>
<p>And the five next traditions are narrated from Saif Ibn Umar Kadhab by Tabari, which spread these lies: </p>
<ul>
<li>Hassan (son of Ali Ibn Abi Talib) stayed in 'Uthman's house to protect him.</li>
<li>'Ali came to provide water to 'Uthman but the opponents didn't allow to do so (Naturally Saif Kadhaab didn't write the complete truth that it was Talha who stopped water upon 'Uthman)</li>
<li>Hazrat Ume Habiba came to provide water.</li>
<li>Please be noted if the water was banned upon 'Uthman, then the only person behind this ban was no other than Talha bin 'Ubaid Ullah. So Muslims should either mention the full traditions mentioning the person's name banning the water on 'Uthman, or stop weeping upon Uthman.</li>
<li>Ayesha was very angry upon the agitators and planned to go to Macca for Hajj. (However, other tradtitions, that are not narrated from Saif Kadhab, clearly describe how Ayesha wanted herself to get Uthman killed.)</li>
<li>Abu Huraira gathered people in favour of 'Uthman. (None of any narrator mentioned Abu Huraira other than Saif Kadhab)</li>
<li>Zubair, Talha, 'Ali and S'ad bin abi Waqas cursed on the killers of 'Uthman. (None of any narrator mentioned this cursing other than Saif Kadhab)</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Next 4 traditions again tell how people entered 'Uthman's house and how they killed him.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId867707"></a>The arrival of 'Uthman's troops and the murder of 'Uthman</h2>
<p>In next tradition, Ibn Jarir Tabari recorded:</p>
<blockquote>According to Muhammad b. ‘Umar (al-Waqidi)-—al-Hakam b. al·Qasim-Abu 'Awn, the client of al-Miswar b. Makhramah: the Egyptians steadfastly abstained from shedding (‘Uthman's) blood and from fighting until [‘Uthman’s] reinforcements from Basrah and Kufah in Iraq and from Syria approached. Their coming encouraged the rebels (a1—qawm) to attack. They learned that detachments had departed from Iraq and from Egypt and the latter sent by Ibn Sa‘d. Previously Ibn Sa'd had not been in Egypt, having fled to Syria. They said, "We must deal quickly with (Uthman), before the reinforcements arrive (after that 'Uthman's supporters killed the Sahabi Niyaar Aslami and thus war started).</blockquote>
<p>So, according to this tradition:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Egyptians did not come to Madina with the intention of killing 'Uthman. They came to get their rights.</li>
<li>They had no link with and Jewish Abdullah ibn Saba and they did not come to kill 'Uthman </li>
<li>But 'Uthman kept on making false promises and he called troops from other provinces to come and kill them. In fact, Uthman would have killed them long before, but People of Madina didn't support him.</li>
<li>And when the Egyptians came to know about the plot by 'Uthman, they had no choice left other than to kill him.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Muslims claim that Companions &amp; Tabaeen of Madina were loyal to Uthman. </p>
<p>But it is enough to see how Uthman was left to rot by these Companions &amp; Tabaeen in order to refute the Muslim claim.</p>
<p>We are presenting all the following Traditions from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-Al-Tabari-Vol-15-Caliphate/dp/0791401545/ref=sr_1_1?crid=11HQ81H3VJEIP&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ghutIwoysetvSdFetWSRssgayJs7sInFH1V8dXOSg54-aKYFv27mh15-rOo32v7bk1PzImpPFFP8H9XpnUMqpDaB5o3VYmtCF6ikPMoKcqf-4PCTW_zLVevK7M8-kB6p1ubUpqfzT28RURPC2XhZKxjLPcvWROMwMwBWvnzsfynqRILz-442V7ySs-GODWbe.Zl0bA00R0NtjaX8lr1QwI1-0Gz9PGkiKVNSHp3e4IUk&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=History+of+Tabari+Volume+15&amp;qid=1734283957&amp;sprefix=history+of+tabari+volume+15%2Caps%2C206&amp;sr=8-1">History of Tabari, Volume 15, Incidents of Year 35 Hijri</a>: Translated by Stephen Humphreys (University of Winsconsin, Madison), published by State University of New York Press. </li>
</ul>
<p>These same traditions have also been mentioned by Ibn Kathir in his Al-badaya wa Al-Nahaya. </p>
<h3>First Tradition:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>(Page 246)<br><br>It was related to me by ]a'far b. 'Abdallah al-Muharnmadi—'Amr b. Hammad and 'Ali b. Husayn-Husayn b. ‘lsa—his father-—Abu<br>Maymunah—Abu Bashir al-'Abidi:<br><strong>'Uthman’s corpse} was thrown aside and left unburied for three days. Then Hakim bin Hizam al-Qurashi, who was a member of the clan of Asad b. ‘Abd al-'Uzza, and Jubayr b. Mut'im b. 'Adi b. Nawfal b. ‘Abd Manaf spoke to 'Ali about his burial, seeking his permission for ['Uthman’s) family to see to that. 'Ali granted them his permis-sion but when news of this spread people lay in wait for ['Uthman’s body] by the road, armed with stones. A few members of his family set out with |his body], intending to take him to an enclosure in Medina named Hashsh Kawkab, where the Jews used<br>to bury their dead. Now when ['Uthman's body] was brought out before the people, they stoned his bier and were bent on throwing him to the ground. When 'Ali hear that, he sent and demanded that they leave him alone. They did so, and ['Uthman’s body] was hurried along and interred in Hashsh Kawkab. When Mu‘awiyah b. Abi Sufyan gained supremacy over the Muslims (al-nas], he ordered that enclosure to be razed and transferred [‘Uthman’s body to al-Baqi'. Then he commanded the people to bury their dead around his grave, until ultimately (those graves] adjoined the cemetery of the Muslims.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p> Ali, Talha, Zubair, Saad bin Abi Waqqas, Imam Hassan, Imam Hussain,........ and a lot of other companions and thousands of other Tabaeen were present in Madiana and it's surroundings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People stoned the body of Uthman, broke his ribs, didn't let him washed (for burrial), didn't offered his funeral prayer (except for 5-6 of his relatives/slaves),..... could Nasibies tell us what those thousands of Sahaba and Taba'een of Madina did in order to protect Uthman?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Second Tradition:</h3>
<p>Page 247<br>It was related to me by Ja'far—'Amr and ‘Ali—Husayn—his father—al-Mujalid b. Sa'id —Yasaar b. Abi Karib—his father Abu Karib, who had been an official in charge of ‘Uthman's treasury:</p>
<p><strong>'Uthman was buried at twilight. Only Marwan b. al-Hakam, three of his free men, an his fifth daughter were present at his funeral. His daughter wailed in mourning and raised Her voice in lament for him. The people took stones and hooted "Long-bearded old idiot [i.e. Nathal]! She was nearly stoned. Then they said, "(Go to] the compotmd, the compound." And thus he was interred in a compound outside [Medina].</strong></p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was 'Aisha bit Abi Bakr (the Mother of Believers) who started saying "Nathal" (old fool) to 'Uthman bin 'Affan. And these People, who are stoning/dragging Uthman's dead body, they are only following 'Aisha bint Abi Bakr. Therefore, 'Uthman was killed in fire which was ignited by 'Aisha bint Abi Bakr. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Third Tradition:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Page 248<br>According to Muhammad (al-Waqidi}—‘Abdallah b. Yazid al-Hudhali—'Abdallah b. Sa‘idah:</p>
<p><strong>For two nights after he was killed, 'Uthman remained [where he had fallen] and they were unable to bury him. Then four men bore [his body] away-——Hakim b. Hizam, Jubayr b. Mut‘im, Niyar b. Mukram, and Abu Jahm b. Hudhayfah. When he was laid down so that the funeral prayer could be per-<br>formed for him, a band of the Helpers (Ansaar of Madina i.e. Sahaba and Tabaeen) came and  forbade them to perform the prayer. These included<br>Aslam b. Aws b. Bajrah al-Saa'idi and Abu Hayyah al-Mazini among several others. They forbade (‘Uthman's supporters) to bury him at al-Baqi‘....<br>So they buried him in Hashsh Kawkab. When the Banu Umayyah reigned, they had that garden included in al-Baqi', and it is today the cemetery of the Banu Umayyah.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Just see it were HELPERS (i.e. Residents of Madina), who consisted of Sahaba as well as Taba'een who forbade them to offer Funeral Prayer at that place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then these were the same Ansaar companions and Taba'een who forbade that 'Uthman is burried in Muslim Graveyard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And due to them 'Uthman was not even burried in Muslim Graveyard but in Jewish Graveyard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Fourth Tradition</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Page 248<br>According to Muhammad (al-Waqidi)—‘Abdallah b. Musa al-Makhzumi:</p>
<p><strong>When 'Uthman was killed, (his assassins) tried to cut off his head, but Na'ilah and Umm al-Banin fell upon him and stopped them. The two women screamed and beat [their] faces and rent their clothing. In the face of this, Ibn 'Udays said, "Leave him." And thus 'Uthman, his corpse still unwashed, was taken out and brougt to al-Baqi'. [The mourners] wanted to perform the funeral prayer for him in the place set aside for funerals, but the Helpers (Ansaar i.e. Sahaba and Tabaeen) refused (to allow that). 'Umayr bin Dhabi' appeared while 'Uthman was stretched out upon a door. 'Umayr jumped 0n him and broke one of his ribs, saying, “You left Dhabi’ in prison until he died there."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h3>Fifth Tradition</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Page 249<br>It was related to me by al-Harith—Ibn Sa°d—Abu Bakr b. ‘Abdallah b. Abi Uways—his grandfather’s paternal uncle, al-Rabi‘ b. Malik b. Abi 'Amir—(Al-Rabi's) father:</p>
<p><strong>I was one 0f 'Uthmarfs pallbearers when he was killed. We carried him upon a door, and his head was bumping up and down on the door because<br>we were walking so fast. We wer possessed with fear until we interred him in his grave in Hashsh Kawkab.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h3>Sixth Tradition:</h3>
<p> We are citing from the following esteemed Sunni works:<br>1. Majma al-Zawaed, by Haythami, Volume 9, page 95<br>2. Al-Muj'am al-Kabir by Tabarani, Volume 1, page 79<br>3. Al-Istiab, by Ibn Abdulbar, Volume 3, page 1048<br><br>We read in Majma al-Zawaid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وعن ملك يعني ابن انس قال قتل عثمان فأقام مطروحا على كناسة بني فلان ثلاثا<br><br>Malik bin Anas said: When Uthman was killed, <strong>his body was thrown in garbage for three days</strong>.<br><br>Imam Abi Bakar Al-Haythami said:‘The narrators are reliable’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover we read in Al-Istiab:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>عن مالك قال لما قتل عثمان رضي الله عنه ألقى على المزبلة ثلاثة أيام<br><br>Malik said: ‘When Uthman [ra] was killed, <strong>they threw him in the garbage for three days’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h3>How many Sahaba &amp; Tabaeen offered Funeral Prayer for 'Uthman?</h3>
<p>There were thousands of Sahaba &amp; Tabaeen present in Madina. </p>
<p>But at end,<strong> there were only 5 people from Bani Ummiyyah who offered funeral prayer</strong> (proofs are present in traditions above). </p>

    <p>For the past 14 centuries, Muslims have attributed the killing of Uthman to the so-called Jewish Sabaies (and their alleged successors, Shias, according to Muslim narratives). This claim is rooted in the fabricated story of Abdullah Ibn Saba, which was concocted by Saif Ibn Umar. We issue a <strong>CHALLENGE</strong> to Muslims: provide a single authentic tradition with a reliable chain of transmission, free from the influence of Saif Ibn Umar, that supports the claim that Jewish Sabaies were responsible for Uthman’s assassination. In contrast, numerous traditions from diverse and credible chains within Islamic sources point to Aisha’s significant role in the agitation that eventually led to Uthman’s killing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Aisha’s role during the life of Uthman</h2>
<p>Many Muslim historians reported that once Aisha visited Uthman and demanded her share of inheritance from the Prophet, even though many years had passed since the Prophet's death. Uthman responded by reminding her that she was among those who had testified and encouraged Abu Bakr to refrain from paying the inheritance share of Fatimah. Uthman questioned why Aisha should receive a share when Fatimah did not. This response angered Aisha greatly, prompting her to leave and shout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kill this old fool (Na'thal), for he is an unbeliever."</p>

<p>Ibn Atheer in Nahaya page 80 Volume 5 and Ibn Mansur in Lisan al Arab Volume 11 Chapter "Lughuth Nathal" page 670 both record that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Nathal is one who has a long beard and Ayesha said kill this Nathal, by Nathal she was referring to ‘Uthman".</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Muslim historian, al-Baladhuri, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the situation became extremely grave, Uthman ordered Marwan Ibn al-Hakam and Abdurahman Ibn Attab Ibn Usayd to try to persuade Aisha to stop campaigning against him. They went to her while she was preparing to leave for pilgrimage, and they told her: “We pray that you stay in Medina, and that Allah may save this man (Uthman ) through you.” Aisha said: “I have prepared my means of transportation and vowed to perform the pilgrimage. By God, I shall not honor your request… I wish he (Uthman ) was in one of my sacks so that I could carry him. I would then throw him into the sea.”</p>
<p>Reference: Ansab al-Ashraf, Volume 6 pages 192-193</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aisha wanted that Uthman should be killed as soon as possible and her cousin Talha become the next caliph. Muslim historian Tabari writes when Uthman was besieged, Ibn Abbas came to Aisha before her journey to Mecca. Aisha appealed Ibn Abbas to incite people against Uthman. Imam Tabari recorded this conversation in his book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Ibn Abbas was setting out for Mecca, he found Aisha in al-Sulsul (seven miles south of Medina). Aisha said: "O' Ibn Abbas, I appeal to you by God, to abandon this man (Uthman) and sow doubt about him among the people, for you have been given a sharp tongue. (By the current siege over Uthman) people have shown their understanding, and light is raised to guide them. I have seen Talha has taken the possession of the keys to the public treasuries and storehouses. If he becomes Caliph (after Uthman), he will follow the path of his parental cousin Abu-Bakr." Ibn Abbas said: "O' Mother (of believers), if something happens to that man (i.e., Uthman), people would seek asylum only with our companion (namely, Ali)." Aisha replied: "Be quiet! I have no desire to defy or quarrel with you."</p>
<p>Reference: History of al-Tabari, English version, v15, pp 238-239</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When ‘Uthman was killed Ayesha who was making her way to Hajj announced that her camp be pitched, she then declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aysha was inciting people against Uthman, when she was informed about his murder while she was in Makka, she spoke in the Shrine (Makka) and said: ‘I believe that Uthman shall bring ill luck on his people (Ummayads) just as Abu Sufyan brought ill luck on his people (disbelievers) on the Day of Badr’.</p>
<p>Reference: Ansab al Ashraf, Volume 6 page 212</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Companions of Muhammad highlighted Ayesha’s shift in policy after the death of Uthman</h2>
<p>The change in circumstances in Ayesha’s portrayal of ‘Uthman from a kaafir to victim occurred when ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib had attained power. Ali had openly questioned Ayesha’s motives in the correspondence with her.</p>
<p>She may well have denied this later, but the fact is companions of Muhammad were fully aware that Ayesha WAS responsible for ‘Uthman’s killing and they pointed this out to her.</p>
<p>In Tareekh Kamil Volume 3 page 100 Ibn Atheer records that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ubayd bin Abi Salma who was a maternal relative of Ayesha met her as she was making her way to Madina. Ubayd said "‘Uthman has been killed and the people were without an Imam for eight days" to which Ayesha asked "What did they do next?". Ubayd said "The people approached '‘Ali and gave him bayya". Ayesha then said 'Take me back! Take me back to Makka". She then turned her face towards Makka and said, 'Verily ‘Uthman was murdered innocently, and By Allah, I shall avenge his blood'. Ubayd then said 'You are now calling ‘Uthman innocent, even though it was you who said 'Kill Nathal, this Jew".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People didn`t forget the behaviour of Aisha during the life of Uthman, and after his killing they are reminding Aisha of that.</p>
<p>‘Ali wrote a letter to Ayesha as recorded in Seerath al Halabiyya Volume 3 page 356:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have acted in opposition to Allah (swt) and his Rasul (s) by leaving your home, you have made demands for those things that you have no right. You claim to wish to reform the Ummah, tell me, what role do women have in reforming the Ummah and participating in battles? You claim that you wish to avenge Uthman ‘s murder despite the fact that he is a man from Banu Ummayya and you are a woman from Banu Taym. If we look in to the matter it was only yesterday that you had said ‘Kill Nathal May Allah (swt) kill him because he has become a kaafir”.</p>
<p>Reference: Seerat al Halabiyah (Urdu), Volume 2 part 2 page 437, translation by Deobandi scholar Maulana Muhammad Aslam Qasmi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, there are atleast 3 testimonies in history from different Sahaba (at 3 different occasions) that Aisha used the word "Nathal" (old fool) for Uthman. </p>
<p>Note: It was so famous that Aisha used to say Nathal to Uthman, that people of Madina also openly started abusing Uthman by using this word. Ibn Kathir Damishqi writes in his book "Al-Badaya wa Al-Nahaya":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Waqadi reported from Usama bin Zaid – from Yaha bin Abdur Rahman bin Hatib – from his father that Uthmand had the staff of Prophet Muhammad (saw). Jahjah Ghafari said to Uthman: "O Nathal! Stand up and get away from this Minbar of Rasool (saw)".</p>
<p>Reference: al-Badaya wa al-Nahaya, volume 7, page 346.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the next page, Ibn Kathir recorded one more tradition about Nathal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Waqidi from Muhammad bin Saleh – from Ubaid bin Rafeh – from Uthman bin Shareed: <em>Once Uthman passed by Jabla bin Sa'adi…… He said: "By Allah! I will kill you O Nathal."</em></p>
<p>Reference: al-Badaya wa al-Nahaya, volume 7, page 347</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Both of these 2 incidents of Jahjah Ghafari and Jabla bin Amr al-Sa'adi (where they abused Uthman by saying him Nathal) occurred in Madina when people of Egypt already left Madian i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>People of Madina were alone there.</li>
<li>And both of them belonged themselves to Madina.</li>
<li>And both of them abused Uthman openly in front of other people of Madina, but neither they stopped them nor took side of Uthman.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ibn Jarir Tabari recorded one more incident about Nathal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Jaffar from Amr and Ali – from Hussain – from his father – from al-Mujalid – Yassiar bin abi Karaib – from his father, who was treasurer of Uthman:</p>
<p>Uthman was burried during night, and Marwan bin Hakam was with him along with three slaves and his daughter. His daughter started lamenting in loud voice.</p>
<p>People took stones in their hands and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>… Nathal…. Nathal ….. and they almost stoned them.</p>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, English Edition, volume 15, page 247</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one from people of Madina participated in the funeral of Uthman (except 7-8 people from Bani Ummaiyyah) i.e. neither Ali norHassan nor Hussain nor other Sahaba like Talha and Zubair, Sa'ad bin Abi Waqas, Abu Huraira etc. participated in his funeral</li>
<li>But we have Muslims who are still shouting on the bases of Saif ibn Umar Kadhab that whole Madina was full supporter of Uthman and it were only few Jewish Sabaies who opposed Uthman and finally killed him.</li>
</ul>
<p>In al-Iqd al-Fareed, Volume 2 page 91:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="right">خرجت عائشة باكيةَ تقول: قُتل عثمان مظلوماً! فقال لها عمار: أنتِ بالأمس تُحرضين عليه، واليومَ تَبْكِين عليه!</div>
<p>Aysha went out weeping and saying: Uthman has been killed as one that is oppressed.’ Ammar bin Yasir replied: ‘Yesterday you were inciting people against him and today you weep for him!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Tabaqat al Kubra, Volume 3 page 82, it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Musrooq said to Aisha, Uthman died because of you, you wrote to people and incited them against him”.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Iqd al Fareed, Volume 2 page 210, it is written that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="right">فقال مَرْوان: فقلت لها: هذا عَملك، كتبتِ إلى الناس تأمرينهم بالخروج عليه</div>
<p><strong>“Marwan approached Aisha and said Uthman died because of you, you wrote to people and incited them against him”.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also in Iqd al Fareed, Volume 2 page 93, it is recorded that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="right">دخل المُغيرة بن شُعبة على عائشة فقالت: يا أبا عبد الله، لو رأيتني يومَ الجمل وقد نفذتْ النِّصالُ هَوْدجي حتى وصل بعضُها إلى جِلْدي. قال لها المغيرة: وددتُ والله أن بَعضها كان قتلك. قالت: يرحمك الله، ولم تقول هذا؟ قال: لعلَها تكون كَفّارة في سَعْيك على عُثمان.</div>
<p><strong>“Mugheera bin Shuba approached Aisha and she said to him, ‘In Jamal some of the arrows that were fired, nearly pierced my skin.’ Mugheera replied ‘If only an arrow had killed you, that would have acted as penance for the fact that you had incited the people to kill Uthman “.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Jarir Tabari also recorded the following tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Jarir Tabari – Ziyaad bin Ayub – Muassab bin Sulaiman al-Tamimi – Muhammad – Asim bin Kulayb – his father:<br>During the time of Uthman bin Affan, I had a dream. I saw a man who was ruling the people while he was ill in bed, and a woman was by his head. The people were after him and hastened toward him and had she forbidden them, they would have stopped. But she did not, so they seized and killed him. I used to recount this dream of mine to everyone, whether settled or nomad, and they were surprised and did not know what it meant.<br>Then when Uthman was killed the news reached us as we were returning from a raid, and my companions said: ‘You dream Kulayb!’. When we got to Basrah, and we had not been there long when someone said: ‘Talha and al-Zubayr are coming and the Mother of the Faithful is with them’. This alarmed the people and they were surprised, but they were claiming to the people that they had only come out of anger over Uthman and in penance over the way they had not supported him. The Mother of the Faithful spoke up: “We became angry at Uthman on your behalf because of three things he did: giving command to youths, expropriating common property and beating (people) with whips and sticks“.</p>
<p>Reference:<strong> </strong>History of Tabari, English Edition, volume 16, pages 99-100</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Ibn Sa'ad recorded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>قال أخبرنا أبو معاوية الضرير قال أخبرنا الأعمش عن خيثمة عن مسروق عن عائشة قالت حين قتل عثمان تركتموه كالثوب النقي من الدنس ثم قربتموه تذبحوه كما يذبح الكبش هلا كان هذا قبل هذا فقال لها مسروق هذا عملك أنت كتبت إلى الناس تأمرهم بالخروج إليه قال فقالت عائشة لا والذي آمن به المؤمنون وكفر به الكافرون ما كتبت إليهم بسوداء في بيضاء حتى جلست مجلسي هذا قال الأعمش فكانوا يرون أنه كتب على لسانها</p>
<p>It is narrated from Aisha when Uthman was killed, she said: "…You people slaughtered Uthman like a sheep. Upon that, Masrooq said to Aisha: "But it was you. You are the one who incited people against Uthman by writing letters to them and asking them to revolt against him."Aisha swore that she didn't write those letters. People thought that those letters were written upon the orders of Aisha.</p>
<p>Reference: Tabaqat Ibn Sa'ad, Urdu Edition, Nafees Academy, volume 2, page 177</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And many Muslim historians also recorded this incident of Ammar Yasir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Aisha knew about the killing of Uthman, she wept and said: "May Allah show His mercy upon him." Upon that Ammar Yasir said: "You are the same person who used to incite the people against Uthman, and now you are weeping."<br>(فقال لھا عمار یاسر: انت بالامس تحرضین علیہ ثم انت الیوم تبکینہ)</p>

<h3>Another Proof of Double Policy: Aisha Declaring Egyptians to be Mazloom in order to Oppose Uthman</h3>
<p>First false news came to Aisha that Uthman was not killed, but he killed all the Egyptians. The reaction of Aisha on this news is very interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Umar bin Shabbah – Abul Hassan al-Madaini – Suhaym, the mawla of Wabrah Al-Tamimi- Ubayd bin Amr al-Qurashi: Aisha had left Madina while Uthman was being besieged. A man [just in from Madina] called Akhdar came up to her in Makka, so she asked: “What are the people doing?” “Uthman has killed the Egyptians” he replied. “We belong to Allah and to Him we return” exclaimed Aisha. “Does he kill people who come seeking justice and denouncing injustice? By Allah! We don’t approve of such a thing”. Presently another man came. “What are the people doing?” she asked. “Uthman has been killed by the Egyptians” he replied. Akhdar amazed. She He alleged that the killed was the killer.</p>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari [English translation] Volume 16 page 39</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Aisha Declaring Egyptians to be Evil People in order to Oppose Ali Ibn Abi Talib</h3>
<p>Before we present the next tradition, we request to keep the following facts in your mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Aisha just declared Egyptians to be a poor Mazloom people in the above tradition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also when Aisha met Ibn Abbas, she showed her wish to install her cousin Talha bin Ubaidullah as next Caliph (and she seems to be quite confident that Uthman is going to be killed sooner or later).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ibn Abbas told her that in case Uthman is killed, then people will only give their allegiance to Ali. Aisha became furious after hearing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then Ibn Umm Kalab (Abd bin Abi Salma) came to Aisha and confirmed her that people chose Ali as their Caliph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After hearing the Caliphate of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Aisha became angry and at once turned back to Mecca and gave the following Sermon there where she declared same Egyptians People to be Evil Agitators.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Ibn Jarir Tabari reported:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At place of Sarif, Aisha met Ibn Umm Kalab. He told her, "Do you know that Uthman has been killed and Medina remained without Caliph for 8 days."<br>Aisha asked what people did then? He replied: "The people of Medina chose Ali ibn Abi Talib as Caliph and gave allegiance to him." Hearing this, Aisha returned back to Mecca (instead of going to Madina) and didn't talk with anyone during the travel … When Aisha came to place of "Hateem", many people gathered there. Aisha addressed them: "O people! The evil agitators from other city and People of Madina together blamed the Shaheed Uthman that he was spreading Fitna, and he made such young boys their leader … Therefore these Evil Agitators turned against Uthman and wanted to snatch Caliphate from him, but they showed that they came fore betterment. When they found no excuse in Uthman then they started the revolt and people came to know about contradiction in their actions. Aisha further says: "By Allah, if whole earth would be filled with dead bodies of these Agitators, then still it is not equal to one finger of Uthman. Therefore I ask you people to help me against these Evil Agitators in order to punish them.</p>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, Urdu Edition, volume 3, page 457 till 458</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Readers would have recognized this dangerous "Double Policy" of Aisha that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>She at once blamed the same people of Egypt to be Evil Agitators, who were earlier Poor People who came to sought Justice.</p>

<li>
<p>And how long did it take for this change? The answer is this change took place during the return journey from place of "Sarf" to "Mecca" (Sarf is 6-12 miles away from Mecca).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And what made Aisha to take this change? Yes, only the news that instead of Talha bin Ubaydullah, people gave oath of allegiance to Ali bin Abi Talib.</p>

<h2>Aisha's defence by Sapah Sahaba Scholar</h2>
<p>Sapah Sahab is an organisation of Sunni Muslims in Pakistan with aim to defend Companions. They have published a book where they have defended Aisha. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160908173911/http://www.kr-hcy.com/tohfa/index2.shtml">This book can also be read online</a> on Sapah Sahaba's own Website.</p>
<p>In question 17, he was asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question 17</strong>: “How were the relations between Aisha And Uthman at the time of his death? Did Aisha incited people by saying "Kill this old Nathal"? And if she incited people and then she went towards Mecca and after hearing the Caliphate of Ali , how she accepted that Uthman was innocent? Tell us if she has personal enmity towards Mawla Ali and if battle of Jamal was fought while Aisha wanted to support Ali or it was the result of enmity towards Mawla Ali ?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In answer to this question, Mawlana Mehr Miyanwalli gives a long description that Uthman was both son and son-in-law for her and they had excellent relations. Then he quotes first tradition in defence of Aisha:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Tradition in Defence of Aisha:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ashtar Nakhi'i asked Aisha what was her opinion on the killing of uthman. She replied: Ma'adh Allah معاذ اللہ, how can I give order for the killing of person, who was Imam (leader) of the Imams (leaders).”</p>
<p>Reference: Tabqat Ibn Sa'as, p 356</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our Comments:</strong></p>
<p>In our opinion, this tradition is instead of defending Aisha, again making this reality clear that Aisha changed her policy after the death of Uthman and started showing Uthman to be an innocent person. That's why people came to her in <strong>SURPRISE</strong>, and asked her about this change of policy (like Ashtar Nakhi'i asked).</p>
<p>And Aisha also knew this fact that poeple had not forgotten her previous behaviour and activities, which she did in order to kill Uthman. That's why she immediately tried to defend her by saying:</p>
<p><em><strong>"How can I order the killing of leader of leaders?</strong></em></p>
<p>Suppose a person comes to you and ask about your opinion about Shah Faisal of Saudia (who was killed). In reply you will only say:</p>
<p><strong>Ah, he was a good guy. May Allah bless him….. etc</strong></p>
<p>But you will not at once start defending yourself by saying:</p>
<p><em>“<strong>How can I order the killing of Shah Faisal……….. “.</strong></em></p>
<p>You would utter those words ONLY then when you know that people are suspecting you to be main killer of Shah Fahad. So, in order to defend yourself, you will start your speech with these words.</p>
<p>That is why this tradition is only showing that People didn’t forget the earlier Role of Aisha and Aisha knew that very well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2</strong><sup><strong>nd</strong></sup><strong> Tradition in Defence of Aisha:</strong></span></p>
<p>Then Mehr Muhammad Miyanwalli presents the 2nd tradition in defence of Aisha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hahrat Aisha once remembered Uthman in these words: By Allah, I never wished that someone insults Uthman. And if I ever wished so, then may Allah make others to insult me in same way. And by Allah, I never wished that Uthman be killed. And had I wished so, then may Allah I be killed too..... Imam Bukhari noted this speech in his Kitab Khalq-ul-Afal Al-Ibad, page 76 (This reference is given in Sirat of Syeda Aisha, p 121, by Syed Sulaiman Nadawi, who was the student of Shibli Numani)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our Comments:</strong></p>
<p>This tradition is once again providing the proof that Aisha was involved in anti-Uthman activities, and later (when she changed her policy after the death of Uthman) wanted to get herself escaped from these accusations. That is why she is saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>" …….. If I had insulted Uthman, then may Allah insult me...... and if wished the killing of Uthman, then may Allah killed me…….".</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a speech can only come out of such a person who has something black in his/her heart, otherwise what Aisha needed to talk about herself in the story of killing of Uthman?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3</strong><sup><strong>rd</strong></sup><strong> Tradition in Defence of Aisha:</strong></span></p>
<p>Sapah Sahaba Scholar narrates this 3<sup>rd</sup> tradition from Umm Kalab when he asked Aisha why she wanted to take revenge of Killing of Uthman, while it was she herself who used to criticize Uthman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aisha replied: "The agitators compelled Uthman to repent, and even after this they killed him. I criticized him while I believed in Agitators who told wrong things about Uthman. But my last saying is better than my first saying."</p>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, volume 4, page 459</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reply 1: Tehreef in this tradition by Sapah Sahaba Scholar</strong></span></p>
<p>Aisha didn't said: "… Agitators told me wrong things about Uthman" but her actual words were: "If I used to incite people for killing Uthman, then all others also used to say the same." </p>
<p>We are presenting the complete Tradition from History of Tabari, so that people can themselves see the deception from Sapah Sahaba Alim, and also see the truth about Aisha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Aishah arrived at Sarif on her way back from visiting Mecca, Ubayd bin Umm Kilab met her. He was Ubayd bin Abi Salamah but named after his mother. ""What is the matter?" "Aishah asked him." They killed Uthman and then did nothing for eight nights." "What did they do then?" she asked. "The people of Medina handled the affair by consensus and matters proceeded very well for them. They agreed upon Ali bin Abi Talib. " "By Allah!" she replied, "Would that the sky were overturned if the command is decided in favour of your leader (i.e. Ali bin Abi Talib).! Take me back! Take me back!</p>
<p>So she departed for Mecca, saying: "By Allah! Uthman has been killed unjustly, and I will seek revenge for his blood!" Ibn Umm Kilab said to her: "How is that? By Allah! You were the first to incline the blade against Uthman and were saying "Kill Nathal", for he has become a disbeliever!" "They asked him to repent," she replied, "and then they killed him. I said things, and they said things, but my latter statement was better than my former one." Ibn Umm Kilab then recited:</p>
<p>"From you come new opinions, from you comes change,</p>
<p>from you are the winds, and from you the rain!</p>
<p>You ordered the killing of the imam,</p>
<p>and told us that he was an unbeliever.</p>
<p>Suppose we did obey you and kill him,</p>
<p>nevertheless hi killer, to our mind, was the one who issued the order.</p>
<p>The roof did not fall down from over us,</p>
<p>our sun and moon were not eclipsed.</p>
<p>The people have given allegiance to on with power,</p>
<p>who will remove the sting and establish pride.</p>
<p>He will put on the clothes for war.</p>
<p>He who fulfills is not like he who has broken contract.</p>
<p>She then set off for Mecca. She dismounted by the entrance of the mosque and made for the Hijr, where she curtained herself off. The people gathered around her, and she said to them, "Uthman has been killed unjustly and by Allah, I will seek vengeance for his blood."</p>
<p><strong>Reference</strong>: History of Tabari, English Edition, volume 16, page 52 and page 53</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By Allah, this latter Statement of Aisha was more dangerous than the first one. Due to her first Statement (i.e. Kill that Nathal) only Uthman bin Affan was killed, but due to her latter Statements, thousands of Muslims were killed in battle of Jamal.</p>
<p>And the only reason behind this Later Statements were her hatred towards Mawla Ali (as) and Ahlulbait (as).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> Tradition in Defence of Aisha:</strong></span></p>
<p>And the last tradition that this scholar presented in defence of Aisha is as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:112">Sunan Ibn Majah 112 (online Link)</a>:</p>
<p>Aisha narrated: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "O Uthman, if Allah places you in charge of this matter (leadership) one day, and the hypocrites try to make you remove the garment that Allah has clothed you with (i.e., the Caliphate), do not remove it." He repeated this three times. Nu'man said, "I asked Aisha, 'What prevented you from informing the people about this?'<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 15);"><strong> She replied, 'I forgot it, by Allah.</strong></span>'"</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>: <strong>Sahih</strong> (Darussalam)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hafiz Ibn Kahir also recorded this traditon in his al-Badaya wa al-Nahaya throught different Chains of narrations (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160908173911/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/qatelaan_uthman/p356_357.jpg">Urdu Edition, Volume 7, page 356</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Our Comments:</strong></p>
<p>Some people were perceptive enough to recognize Aisha’s behavior during the events surrounding Uthman’s life and death. This is why a narrator questioned Aisha about why she did not convey this Hadith on the day Uthman was killed. Her response, claiming that she had forgotten it, appears to be an unconvincing excuse.</p>
<p>Dear readers, how could such an important Hadith, with its direct relevance to Uthman’s situation, be forgotten on such a critical occasion? Moreover, the siege of Uthman lasted for approximately 40 days, during which this so-called "forgetfulness" persisted. Why did Aisha fail to recall this Hadith throughout that time? And interestingly, why did she suddenly remember it later when it was time to rally people against Ali?</p>
<p>Additionally, it is worth noting that the term "Shirt of Caliphate" was first used by Uthman himself. However, he referred to it without attributing it to the Prophet, presenting it as his own phrase rather than a prophetic instruction. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Malik Ibn Ashtar asked Uthman to withdraw from Caliphate in order to end that agitation, upon that Uthman answered: "I like more that my neck is beheaded as compared<strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 15);"> to remove that Shirt, which Allah made me to wear</span></strong>."</p>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, volume 3, page 381</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Once again, we challenge Muslims to provide even a single authentic tradition, free from the influence of Saif Ibn Umar, that claims it was the Jewish Sabaies who were responsible for Uthman’s assassination. If they cannot present such evidence, they must explain why they reject the numerous reports highlighting Aisha’s role—reports that are transmitted through far stronger and more reliable chains of narration than those attributed to Saif Ibn Umar, known for his fabrications.</p>

    <h1>Marwan bin Hakam killed Talha !!!  But WHY?</h1>
<p>Marwan was cousin of Uthman and his most trusted companion, who stayed with throughout the whole siege. </p>
<p>And yes, Marwan bin Hakam killed Talha while he knew very well that Talha conspired against Uthman and finally killed him. And it was not only Marwan, but whole Bani Ummiyyah considered Talha as Killer of Uthman.</p>
<p>Esteemed Muslim Scholar Ibn Kathir reported in "Al-Badaya wa Al-Nahaya", Volume 7 page 248 Dhikr Jamal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl" align="right">ويقال: إن الذي رماه بهذا السهم مروان بن الحكم وقال لأبان بن عثمان: قد كفيتك رجلا من قتلة عثمان.</p>
<p>“Talha was killed in the battle of Jamal by the arrow of Marwan, who then told Aban-bin-Utham that I have taken the revenge for the blood of your father ‘Uthman”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is written in Riyahul Nudhra, v 4, p 34:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" Marwan after killing Talha declared that there was no longer any need to avenge the slaying of ‘Uthman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The classical books of history record from Yahya Ibn Sa'id:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marwan Ibn al-Hakam, who was in the ranks of Talha, saw Talha who was retreating (when his army was being defeated in the battlefield). Marwan and all Bani Ummayya considered him as the killer of Uthman. Marwan shot an arrow at him and severely wounded him. He then said to Aban, the son of Uthman, that: "I have spared you from one of your father's murderers." Talha was taken to a ruined house in Basra where he died.</p>

<p>".... Ali told to the young boy (of his army), "Hold this (Quran) up before them and say, "Every word in this shall judge between you and us, and I beg of you for Allah's sake to stop shedding our blood and yours.".<br>But, with the copy of the Quran in his hand, the boy was attacked. His hands were cut off, so he took it in his teeth until he was killed. Ali then said, "Battle is now justified, so fight them!".<br>Seventy men were killed that day, each holding in turn the nose rein of Aishah's camel. After the camel was hamstrung and the force was routed, an arrow hit Talha and killed him. It is said that it was Marwan bin Hakam who fired this arrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2>Testimony of Sapah Sahab Alim that Marwan killed Talha, while he considered him killer of Uthman</h2>
<p>Zafar Ahamad Uthmani wrote a book "Barat-e-Uthman" (in Urdu). This book has been publised on net by Sapah Sahab Website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141014190524/http://www.kr-hcy.com/">www.kr-hcy.com</a> .</p>
<p>Let us see the witness of this Sapah Sahaba A'alim that Marwan bin Hakam killed Talha, while he considered him to be the killer of Uthman. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hafidh Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani wrote in "Fath al-Bari": "Another big objection on Marwan is this that during the battle of Jamal, he shot an arrow on Talha and he died. And he also rose the sword for Caliphate after Muawiyya Ibn Yazid".<br>Ismael has answered about killing of Talha that this killing took place due to the mistake of "Taweel" تاویل, like other Sahaba were killed at the hands of each other in this battle.. But Imam Malik has accepted his Ahadith in Fiqh and all other compilers of Sahah Satta (except Muslim) gathered his Ahadith in their books."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Response: This excuse of "Taweel تاويل" is not possible here, as Marwan was the closest companion of Uthman, and he was with him during the whole siege. Thus, if any one knew about the killers of Uthman, then it was Marwan bin Hakam. </p>
<p>Even Marwan is himself giving the testimony of this fact from his own tongue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When Uthman was killed, and Talha, Zubair and A'aisha went to Basra in order to avenge the blood of 'Uthman, at that time Marwan also accompanied them. When all the people were running away in battlefield (after 'Aisha's forces were defeated), Marwan saw Talha and said: "By Allah, he is responsible for killing of Uthman, and indeed he treated Uthman badly. And I need no other testimony after watching all this from my own eyes. He took an arrow and shot it to Talha, which killed him."</p>
<p>Reference: Tabaqat Ibn Sa'ad, Urdu Edition, Nafees Academy, vol. 5, page 55.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Witness of Talha's Son, that his father was involved in Killing of Uthman</h2>
<p>Talha played such a great role in the killing of Uthman, that even his own son accepted it.</p>
<p>Ibn Qutaiba writes in his book "Al-Imama Wa Siyyasah", page 60:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Someone asked Muhammad bin Talha that who killed Uthman. He replied that "one third of his death was attributable to Ayesha and one third was due to my father Talha".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Jarir Tabari reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One person came to Muhammad bin Talha (the son of Talha). This Muhammad bin Talha was a very pious man. That person asked him: "Who killed Uthman?" Muhammad bin Talha answered: "Three people are responsible for the killing of Uthman. One third responsibility goes to this woman, who is riding this camel (i.e. 'Aisha). And one third goes to the rider of that red camel i.e. my father Talha. And remaining one third goes upon Ali Ibn Abi Talib.<br>Upon this that person recited the following poetry:<br>"I asked son of Talha who is responsible for killing of that person in Madina, who even didn't get the funeral.<br>He replied: One third is this woman on camel, one third is upon rider of that red camel (i.e. Talha) and one third upon Ali Ibn Abi Talib.<br>It is like this that we are simple people and don't know much. And I answered him:<br>You told the truth about the first 2 people, but you made a mistake about the 3rd person."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, vol. 3, page 478 (published by Daarul Isha'at Pakistan)</p>
<p>Also in Iqd al Fareed Volume 2 page 218 and al Imama wal Siyasa page 45 we are told that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sad ibn Abi Waqqas was asked 'who killed ‘Uthman? Sad replied, 'the sword was lifted by Ayesha and it was sharpened by Talha".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We read in Iqd al Fareed page 220 that Hadhrat Naila (Uthman's wife) wrote a letter to Mu’awiya bin Hind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From Nayla-bint-e-Farasa to Mu'awiya bin Abi Sufyan. I was present at the time when ‘Uthman was murdered and I shall narrate the event to you. People of Madina surrounded ‘Uthman’s house and they started guarding the door with their weapons. For fifty nights they did not let anything enter the house. It was Muhammad bin Abu Bakr, Ammar Yasir, Talha and Zubayr that gave the order to the people to kill ‘Uthman”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, we read in Fusul al Muhimma page 79 Dhikr Jamal and Mutalib al Saul page 117 Dhikr Jamal that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Ali asked Zubayr about the reasons that made him fight against him, to which Zubayr stated, “I want to fight to avenge the murder of ‘Uthman”. Imam ‘Ali replied, “If you have justice in your heart, you would realize that it was you and your friends that murdered ‘Uthman”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Jarir Tabari recorded from Ahmad bin Zuhair - He from his father Khuthaima - Wahab bin Jarir - from his father - from Younis bin Yazid - from Zuhri:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The news, that is, of the seventy who were killed with al-Abdi at al-Basrah, reached Ali, so he advanced with 12000 men and came to al-Basrah ......When the forces confronted each other, Ali went out on his horse and called out to al-Zubayr and the two of them confronted each other.....Ali said to al-Zubair: "Are you asking me for compensation for the blood of 'Uthman, when it was you who killed him? I ask Allah in His power right now to give a hateful punishment to he among us who was the severest in opposing 'Uthman." Ali said to Talhah: " You have brought the Messenger of Allah's wife to make her fight while you hide your wife at home.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, English Edition, page 125 and Page 126</p>
<p>This same tradition is with almost similar words has also been recorded by Ibn Jarir Tabari - Abu Bakr - Qatadah:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Reference: History of Tabari, English Edition, volume 16, page 115  and Page 116</p>
<p>In Al Istiab Volume 3 page 213 “Dhikr Talha” and “Layneen fi Tafseel Shaykhain page 280 “Dhikr Muthaen Ali”, one of Imam ‘Ali (as)’s speeches is recorded in which he declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Talha, Zubayr and Ayesha ask the right for something which they themselves abandoned. And ask to revenge the blood, which they themselves shed. They were responsible for the killing of ‘Uthman, to which I was not a party, but now they deny it. I am not a party to ‘Uthman’s killing, and the only culprit party to pay for the killing of ‘Uthman is this rebel group. They made their oath of allegiance to me and then broke it”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And following is the opinion of 'Aisha and people on the role of Talha and Zubair about the killing of 'Uthman:</p>
<p lang="de-DE">"Ibn Jarir Tabari - Ziyaad bin Ayub - Muassab bin Sulaiman al-Tamimi - Muhammad - Asim bin Kulayb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Kulayb said when they came back from Jahaad, then it became famous that after some days Talha and Zubayr were arriving and Umm Momineen 'Aisha is also with them. People were astonished to hear it as they thought that they themselves were angry with 'Uthman and they made people to rovolt against him. And now they were taking the name of avenge of Uthman in order to make them free of this charge).<br>'Aisha said: "We became angry at 'Uthman on your behalf because of three things he did: giving command to youths, expropriating common property and beating (people) with whips and sticks" .</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Some more incidents from History of Tabari</h2>
<p>Ibn Jarir Tabari from Muhammad bin Umar (al-Waqidi) - Abrahim bin Sulaym - from his father - Basr bin Sa'eed - Abdullah Ibn Abbas (/Ayyash) bin Rabia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I entered Uthman's presence (During the agitation against Uthman) and talked with him for an hour. He said: "Come Ibn Abbas/Ayyash," and he took me by the hand and had me listen to what the people were saying at his door. We heard some say, "what are you waiting for," while others were saying, "wait, perhaps he will repent." While the two of us were standing there (behind the door and listening), Talha Ibn Ubaydillah passed by and said: "Where is Ibn Udays?" He was told, "He is over there." Ibn Udays came to (Talha) and whispered something with him, and then went back to his associates and said: "Do not let anyone go in (to the house of Uthman) to see this man or leave his house."<br>Uthman said to me: "These are the orders of Talha." He continued, "O God! Protect me from Talha for he has provoked all these peopleagainst me. By God, I hope nothing will come of it, and that his own blood will be shed. Talha has abused me unlawfully. I heard the Messenger of God said: 'The blood of a Muslim is lawful in three cases: apostasy, adultery, and the one who kills except in legitimate retaliation for another.' So why should I be killed?"<br>Ibn Abbas continued: I wanted to leave (the house), but they blocked my path until Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr who was passing by requested them to let me go, and they did so.</p>

<h1>Ali Ibn Abi Talib stopped Talha from killing Uthman</h1>
<p>Uthman was besieged in Medina while Ali Ibn Abi Talib was in Khaibar. When Ali came to Medina and found people gathering at the residence of Talha, he went to met Uthman.</p>
<p>Ibn Athir wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uthman said to Ali: "You owe me my Islamic right and the right of brotherhood and relationship. If I have non of these rights and if I were in pre-Islamic era, it would be still shame for a descendants of Abd Munaf (of whom both Ali and Uthman are descendants) to let a man of Tyme (Talha) rob us of our authority." Ali said to Uthman: "You shall be informed of what I do." Then Ali went to Talha's house. There were a lot of people there. Ali spoke to Talha saying: "Talha, what is this condition in which you have fallen?" Talha replied: "O' Abul Hasan! it is to late!"</p>

<p>Tabari also reports the following conversation between Imam Ali and Talha during the siege over Uthman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ali said to Talha: "I ask you by Allah to send people away from (attacking) Uthman." Talha replied: "No, by God, not until the Umayad voluntarily submit to what is right." (Uthman was the head of Umayad).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference: History of al-Tabari, English version, v15, p235</p>
<p>Simlarly Ibn Asakir has written in Tarikh of Damishq, Bab of Uthman, page 407:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Qais says that one man came to meet Talha while Uthman was besieged. He requested Talha to interfere in this matter and make sure about the safety of Utman. Talha replied: "No, by God, not until the Umayad voluntarily submit to what is right." (Uthman was the head of Umayad).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, see the following tradition, where Mawla Ali (as) particularly pointed out Talha as Killer of Uthman:</p>
<p>"According to Muhammd - Hisham bin Sa'd - Abu Hilal - Ibn Abbas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five days after the murder of 'Uthman, I arrived in Medina from Mecca. I went to go and visit Ali but was told that al-Mughirah bin Shubah was with him. So I sat at the entrance for an hour. When Mughirah came out, he greeted me and said, "How long ago did you get here?". "This past hour, " I replied. I then went into Ali and greeted him. He asked me, "Did you meet al-Zubayr and Talhah?" " I met them in al-Nawasif." "Who was with them?" he asked. "Abu Said bin Harith bin Hisham with a Qurashi force," I replied. Ali then said: "I am sure they will never refrain from coming out and saying, "We sek repayment for Uthman's blood. By Allah! We know that they are the ones who killed uthman."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, English Edition, volume 16, page 23</p>
<p>Talhah also knew all of his crimes. Imam Jarir Tabari has recorded:</p>
<p>According to Ahmad bin Mansur - Yahya bin Main - Hisham bin Yousuf the qadi of Sana - Abdullah b Musab bin Thabit bin Abdullah bin al-Zubayr - Musa bin Uqbah - Alqamah bin Waqqas al-Laythi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Talhah and al-Zubayr and Aisha set out, I noticed that Talhah preferred to sit alone and would flick his beard against his chest. So I said to him: "Abu Muhammad! I see that yoou prefer to sit alone and keep flicking your beard against your chest. If there is something you dislike [going on], sit [and talk about it]!" "Alqamah bin Waqqas, "He replied to me, "we were all united against others. But now we have become two mountains of iron, each seeking to [finish] the other. There was indeed some thing I did against Uthman and my penance for it can be nothing less than having my blood spilled in the course of seeking vengeance for his blood."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, English Edition, volume 16, page 79</p>
<p>Saeed bin al-Aas also told Marwan why he wanted to fight Ali when killers of Uthman are already with him.</p>
<p>Ibn Jarir Tabari recorded from Umar bin Shabbah - Abu al-Hasan - Abu Amr - Utbah bin al-Mughirah bin al-Akhnas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Dhat Irq Said bin al-Aas met Marwan bin al-hakam and his men and asked: "Where are you heading for? Those from whom you seek revenge are on the rumps of camels. Kill them and then go back to your houses! "</p>

<h2>Talha even deprived Uthman of water</h2>
<p>Muslims describe very often that even water was stopped on Uthman, but they never tell who stopped that water.</p>
<p>Tabari from Muhamad bin Umar (al-Waqidi) - Ibn Abi A'oun - he from his father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abdurrahman Ibn al-Aswad said: "I constantly saw Ali avoiding (Uthman) and not acting as he formerly had. However, I know that he spoke with Talha when Uthman was under siege, to the effect that water skins should be taken to him. Ali was extremely upset (from Talha) about that until finally water skins were allowed to reach Uthman."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference: History of al-Tabari, English version, v15, pp 180-181</p>
<p>The respected Muslim Historian Al-Baladhori writes in his book al-Ansaab al-Ashraaf:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"None of any Companion opposed Uthman as much as it was done by Talha. He took the things into his hands along with Zubair. Talha also stopped water to reach Uthman. Ali bin Abi Talib was in his property, which was one mile away from Madina. When he came to know this, he sent a message to Talha to let Uthman have water from the well of "Bair-e-Roma" and don't let him dirsty. But Talha refused to accept that,"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference: Al-Ansaab al-Ashraaf, volume 5, page 90</p>
<p>Imam Tabari recorded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When people besieged Uthman and water is stopped for him, upon that Uthman wrote to Ali and asked him for help and for water.<br>Ali talked with Talha, but he refused. Upon that Ali became so much enraged that Talhah got no other choice other than to accept it. At end, water was put on animals and sent to Uthman's house."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference: History of Tabari, Arabic Version, volume5, page 113</p>
<p>Al-Baladhori also recorded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When people besieged Utman and stopped water to reach him, he (Uthman) was compelled to come out of his house. He asked people if Ali is present there. People replied, "No". Upon that Uthman asked if Sa'ad bin Abi Waqqas is present there, but people again replied in negative.<br>Then Utman kept quite for some time and then said: "Could any one among you go to Ali and tell him to bring water to us?"<br>When Ali got this message, he sent 3 pots of water to Uthman. And along with water he also sent Bani Hashim and slaves of Bani Ummaiyyah in order to protect that water. But till the time water reached Uthman, many of those slaves were injured by people."</p>

<p>Reference: Al-Ansaab al-Asharaaf, volume 5, page 74</p>
<h2 lang="en-US">Talha wrote Letters to Basra against Uthman</h2>
<p lang="en-US">Ibn Jarir Tabari narrated from Ahmad – from his father – from Wahab bin Jarir bin Hazim – from Younis bin Yazeed – from Zuhri:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>".... (Uthman bin Haneef made peace with Aisha, Talha and Zubair on the condition that he will lead the prayers until reply comes from Madina).<br>But they waited only two days and then attacked Uthman and fought with him at al-Zabuqah near the supply center. They gained the upper hand and captured Uthman. They were about to kill him but then they feared the warth of Ansar. So they attacked his hair and body instead.<br>Talhah and al-Zubair then rose to make speeches and said:<br>People of al-Basrah! Repentance should fit the crime. We wanted the Commander of Faithful only to get Uthman to satisfy [our complaints]. We didn't want him to be killed, but the fools prevailed over the wise men and killed him." "But Abu Muhammad!" the people replied Talhah."The letters you sent us said otherwise." [Talhah was unable to answer them, and upon that al-Zubayr said]"Did you [also] receive any letter from me about what he was doing?`"Asked al-Zubayr, going on to mention Uthman's murder and what led to it and to emphasize Ali's blame in it.<br>At this a man from Abd al-Qays stood up facing him and said: "Be silent, man! And listen so that we may speak." Abdallah bin al-Zubayr retorted, "What position are you in to speak?" "Company of Muhajirun!" said the Abdi. "You were the first to respond to the message of God, and you gained favour through that, and then everyone else entered Islam following your example. Then when the Messenger of God died you gave allegiance to one of your number, but by Allah, you didn't consult us in any way about it. We gave our approval nevertheless and went along with you, and Almighty and Glorious Allah blessed the Muslims through His caliphate. Then he died, having appointed a man Caliph in his place over you. Again you didn't discuss it with us, but we gave our approval and accepted. When this caliph died, he placed the decision in the hands of six men, and you chose Uthman and gave him allegiance without consulting us. Then you found some faults with this man, so you killed him without consulting us. Then you gave allegiance to Ali, without consulting us. So what exactly are you angry with him about that we should fight him? Has he appropriated booty or carried out som injustice? Has he done something you object to such that we should join you against him? If not, then what is going on?"<br>Talhah and al-Zubayr's men then tried to kill this Abdi, but his tribesmen stood in their way. But the next morning they leaped on him and his men and killed seventy men."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference:History of Tabari, English Edition, vol. 16, page 68 and Page 69</p>
<p>Historian Ibn Qutaybah writes in his book "Al-Immamah wa al-Siyassah", page 64 that when Aisha, Talha and Zubair came to Basra, a person came to them and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Talhah, do you recognise this letter? Talhah replied, "Yes". Upon this that person said, "Don't you have any shame that some days ago you wrote letters to us asking us to revolt against Uthman, and now you are asking us to help you in taking his revenge."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muslims don't have even a SINGLE tradition which is pure of Saif ibn Umar, which tells us that such and such Jewish Sabaies existed who conspired against Uthman and misguided Sahaba, and finally killed Uthman. But still Muslims are doing this propaganda for the last 1200 hundred years that it were Jewish Sabaies who killed Uthman.</p>
<p>Compared to this, Muslims are unable to see all these Traditions about Talha and Zubair (which are much stronger than fairy tale of Saif Ibn Umar).</p>

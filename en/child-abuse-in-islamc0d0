<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId183278"></a>Summary:</h2>
<p>According to Islam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon purchase, a male adult slave becomes Mahram to all the wives and daughters of his owner, granting him the privilege to enter and stay in the same house with them without any concern.</li>
<li>However, in the case of an adopted son, even if he was lovingly cared for and raised by his foster mother from childhood, he does not acquire the status of Mahram after reaching adulthood. As a consequence, it is not permissible for the adopted son and his mother to be alone under one roof, and it would be considered a CRIME to do so.</li>
<li>Thus, the adopted son should be kicked out of the house as soon as he becomes an adult.</li>
</ul>
<p>And Islam is even crueller upon the poor adopted orphan daughter. while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islam allows the foster father to look at her with LUST. </li>
<li>If she is beautiful, then the foster father is fully allowed by Sharia to forcefully take her into his Nikah, and then he can drive all types of sexual pleasures with her even if she is a baby (Please read our article: <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/child-rape-in-islam/islam-even-a-breastfed-baby-girl-can-be-married-and-used-for-sex">Islam: Even a breastfed baby Girl can be married and used for sexual pleasure). </a>Neither Islamic courts, nor the foster mother of that orphan girl, nor society can stop the foster father to use her for his lust. She is put totally at the mercy of her foster father by Islamic Sharia. </li>
<li>And not only for her beauty, but a foster father can also forcefully make her into his marriage in order to get his hands on her property and money. This happened during the time of Muhammad when a foster father married his adopted daughter for her property. </li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, in Islam, the consequences of adoption can be quite severe, not only depriving orphan adopted children of their foster parents but also uprooting them from their entire adopted family. For instance:</p>
<p>An orphan adopted boy not only loses his foster mother but also his foster sisters, and he is forced to leave the house, leaving him without any family support. This situation leaves the orphan boy entirely alone, without a family to call his own.</p>
<p>Similarly, an orphan adopted daughter faces a similar fate, losing not just the care and love of her foster father, but also her foster brothers.</p>
<p>One cannot help but recognize the inherent cruelty and injustice in these Sharia Rulings, which seem to go against the natural bonds of humanity. The implications of such rulings raise concerns about their compatibility with human nature and compassion.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId70507"></a>The status of one who fosters and raises a child is HIGHER than the one who gives birth to that child</h2>
<p>The role of a foster parent is esteemed higher than that of a biological parent, as it is not about who gave birth to a child but rather about who fosters, loves, and cares for them. A child instinctively seeks comfort and affection from the person who nurtures and supports them.</p>
<p>The significance of fostering can even be observed in the animal kingdom. For instance, if you place the eggs of a hen under a duck, the chicks hatched from those eggs will still consider the duck as their mother, as they witness her caring for them. This bond is formed despite the lack of a biological connection.</p>
<p>Indeed, the status of a foster parent surpasses that of a biological parent. When a foster mother or father lovingly raises a child, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>natural parent-child bond</strong></span> develops between them</span>.</p>
<p>Throughout history, every society has recognized and accepted the powerful bond between an adopted child and their foster parents. This bond is also supported by numerous experiments and acknowledged by psychiatrists worldwide.</p>
<p>However, in the context of Islam, this natural bond is denied, and this is a unique aspect of the ideology. The reason behind this denial was the desire of Muhammad for the wife of his adopted son. He became infatuated with his daughter-in-law upon seeing her in a semi-naked state and used revelations to justify denying any bond between adopted children and their foster parents. Consequently, he made it permissible for him to marry his daughter-in-law.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId443131"></a>Fatwas that an adopted son becomes Na-Mahram upon puberty and should be separated from his mother who raised him</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811120731/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/389746/must-observe-hijab-in-front-of-an-adopted-boy">Fatwa from Sunni website Islamweb.net:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Question from a mother:</strong></em> Is it a sin if I don't observe hijab in front of my adopted son? I don't want to as it makes him feel like a stranger, and hurts him. Is there any way I can avoid hijab in front of him?</p>
<p><em><strong>Answer: </strong></em>This boy is considered as a non-Mahram to you. Therefore, if he has reached the age of puberty or nearly so, then you must observe Hijaab in front of him (even if it hurts him), and you are not permitted to be in seclusion with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129988/a-family-adopted-him-because-his-family-were-bad-people-and-they-gave-him-their-name-what-are-the-consequences-of-that">Fatwa from Saudi Salafi Fatwa website: Isalm Q&amp;A:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> I am fifteen years old. An Afghan family adopted me when I was six months old ... What are the rulings in my situation?</p>
<p><strong><em>Answer:</em></strong> ...  The woman who adopted you is a non-mahram to you, and it is not permissible for you to see her, let alone touch her or kiss her when you are not a mahram to her or to her daughters. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to understand the severity of this Islamic ruling, take a look at this fatwa (<a href="https://www.banuri.edu.pk/readquestion/mun-bole-betay-se-parde-ka-hukum/01-01-2010">link</a>), where a Muslim mother found herself in tears, refusing to be separated from her adopted son when he reached the age of 12-13 years. However, the relatives insisted on forcibly separating them, and the Muslim Mufti supported their decision, citing it as Allah's command in Islam. According to the reasoning, Allah fears that allowing both Na-Mahrams (the mother and her 12-14 years old adopted son) to stay together under one roof may lead to the Fitna of fornication.</p>
<p>It is crucial to reflect on the tragedy and hardship that this Islamic ruling brought upon the poor mother and her child. The situation exemplifies the difficulties and heartache that can arise due to this particular aspect of Islamic law.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId619088"></a>Islam snatched away the whole family from an orphan adopted child</h2>
<p>In Islam, an orphan adopted child loses their entire family twice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, when their biological parents pass away and they are given up for adoption.</li>
<li>Secondly, as they become adults, they are forced to leave the house, and their foster mother and sisters become non-Mahram to them. They find themselves alone once again, without any family.</li>
</ul>
<p>This fate is challenging for an adopted orphan boy, as upon reaching adulthood, he not only loses his parents but also his entire family, including his sisters.</p>
<p>The situation is even more distressing for an adopted orphan girl. Upon becoming an adult, she loses the love and care of her foster father and brothers, and she must observe Hijab from them as they become non-Mahram to her.</p>
<p>A concerning aspect of this Islamic ruling is that it allows a foster father and foster brothers to look at her with lust from her childhood, as they are permitted to marry her under Islamic Sharia.</p>
<p>Overall, this aspect of Islamic law results in a deeply troubling and difficult situation for orphan adopted children, leaving them without a family support system during critical stages of their lives.</p>
<p>Moreover, Islamic Shariah not only prohibits the adoption of orphans, but it also allows to beat orphans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imam Bukhari recorded in his book <a href="https://sunnah.com/adab:142">Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, Hadith 142</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Shumaysa al-'Atakiyya said, "The disciplining of orphans was mentioned in the presence of 'A'isha and she said, '<strong>I would beat an orphan until he submits</strong>.'"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Grade: <strong>Sahih </strong>(Albani)</blockquote>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId464406"></a>According to Islamic Sharia, an adopted son or daughter will not receive any share in the inheritance of their foster parents</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The next law about an adopted son/daughter in Islamic Sharia is:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">An adopted son/daughter will get no share in the inheritance. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The estate will be divided into far-related relatives, but it will not be given to the adopted son/daughter. </li>
</ul>
<p>Can you imagine that a far-related relative can get the share (or whole inheritance), but an adopted son/daughter, who was loved and cared for as a real son/daughter, then he/she will get nothing from the inheritance? </p>
<p>Even the pre-Islamic Arab culture (which is blamed to be the time of ignorance), showed much more compassion towards the weakest members of the society (i.e. orphans) and gave them the right to have names of their adopted fathers and also to inherit them. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4000">Sahih Bukhari, 4000</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: ... In the Prelslamic period of ignorance the custom was that, if one adopted a son, <strong>the people would call him by the name of the adopted-father</strong> <strong>whom he would inherit as well,</strong> till Allah revealed: "Call them (adopted sons) By (the names of) their fathers." (33.5)</p>

</div>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId920530"></a>Contradiction in Sharia: An adult male slave becomes Mahram to all the wives &amp; daughters of the owner as soon as he is bought from the market</h2>
<p>An intriguing contradiction arises in Islamic Sharia:</p>
<p>Unlike an adopted son, an adult male slave becomes Mahram to all the wives and daughters of the owner as soon as he is purchased from the slave market. Instantly, he gains the privilege to stay alone with the owner's wife or daughter under one roof without any need for her to observe Hijab or hide her adornments (Zinah) from him.</p>
<p>This striking contrast in treatment between an adopted son and a male slave raises questions about the consistency and fairness of the rules within Islamic Sharia.</p>
<p>Surah Nur, Verse <a href="https://quranx.com/24.31">24:31</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And say to the believing women (that) they should lower [of] their gaze and they should guard their chastity, and not (to) display their adornment except what is apparent of it. And let them draw their head covers over their bosoms, and not (to) display their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers or fathers (of) their husbands or their sons or sons (of) their husbands or their brothers or sons (of) their brothers or sons (of) their sisters, or their women or <em><strong>what possess their right hands (i.e. slaves)</strong></em> or the attendants having no physical desire among [the] men or [the] children who (are) not aware of private aspects (of) the women. And not let them stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to Allah altogether O believers! So that you may succeed. (Corpus Quran)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surah Nur, Verse <a href="https://quranx.com/24.58">24:58</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O you who believe! Let ask your permission those whom possess your right hands (i.e. slaves) and those who (have) not reached puberty among you (at) three times, before (the) prayer (of) dawn, and when you put aside your garments at noon and after (the) prayer (of) night. (Corpus Quran)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also read the following <em>hadith</em>, where Muhammad was telling his daughter Fatima that she didn't need to do Hijab from the male slave.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4106">Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 4106</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) brought Fatimah a slave which he donated to her. Fatimah wore a garment which, when she covered her head, did not reach her feet, and when she covered her feet by it, that garment did not reach her head. When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw her struggle, he said: <strong><em>There is no harm to you: Here is only your father and slave</em></strong>.<br><strong>Grade</strong>: <strong><em>Sahih</em></strong> (Albani)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, Islam forbids an adopted son from being alone with his mother, whom he has been raised by and loved as his own since childhood. According to Sharia rules, if they are alone in the house, it is considered a crime, and they must be punished for it. The Prophet of Islam said: “No man is alone with a woman except the third one present is the Shaytaan.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2165); classed as Saheeh by al-Albaani.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, Islam permits an adult male slave to be Mahram to all the wives and daughters of his owner immediately after he is bought from the slave market. He can stay alone with the owner's wife or daughter in the same house, without the need for her to observe Hijab or hide her adornments (Zinah) from him.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Are you able to see this huge contradiction in Islam? </p>
<h2>Contradiction in Sharia: Comparing the Wife to the Mother Orally immediately makes her Haram</h2>
<p><span>On one side, if a foster mother calls an orphan child her son his whole life, then Islam says there is no value of such Oral Calling, and the adopted son should leave the house after becoming an adult. </span></p>
<p><span>But on the other hand, if a husband orally says to his wife that she resembles his mother (or if her back resembles his mother's back), then the wife becomes immediately HARAM for him due to this oral sentence. </span></p>
<p><span>During the era of ignorance in Arab society, there was a peculiar custom known as <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/84-zihar-another-unjust-islamic-way-to-divorce-a-woman">Zihar (ظھار)</a>. If a man, in a fit of anger or unintentionally, compared his wife to his mother or her back to his mother's back, it was considered grounds for separation, akin to a divorce. When Islam emerged, it continued to endorse this foolish tradition of Zihar and it is still valid till today in Islamic Sharia. Yes, e</span><span>ven today, if any Muslim compares his wife to his mother, then it is like a DIVORCE and they become non-Mahram, they cannot stay under one roof, and they must be separated. If they want to reunite, then they have to free slaves or to fast for two months. Please read all details here:</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span>On the other hand, an adopted child calls a woman his mother his whole life, but it does not matter for Islam. </span></p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId920239"></a>The adopted daughter is in danger of being forcefully married by her foster Muslim father if he lusts for her</h2>
<p>According to human nature, every minor child girl needs the selfless love and care of a father.</p>
<p>But what Muhammad did, is as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad first destroyed the sacred bond between the adopted child and the parents and allowed marriage between them. </li>
<li>By doing so, Islam made an adopted daughter <strong>a sex object</strong> in the eyes of the foster father (and also foster brothers) right from the very first day. </li>
<li>If the adopted daughter is beautiful or wealthy, then the foster father can forcefully take her into his Nikah, and neither any Islamic court nor the foster mother can stop him from doing so. </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of these Sharia Rulings, Muhammad's companions began to exploit them, using them as a means to forcefully marry their adopted daughters for reasons like beauty and wealth.</p>
<p>When Muhammad became aware of this misuse, he found himself unable to prevent the men from engaging in such practices. This was due to the fact that he himself had established these two Sharia Rulings primarily to serve his personal interests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muhammad married 'Aisha when she was still a minor, and her father Abu Bakr did not need to seek her consent before marrying her off to Muhammad.</li>
<li>Muhammad declared the bond with adopted children as void, and he went on to marry Zainab, who happened to be his daughter-in-law and the wife of his adopted son.</li>
</ol>
<p>This created a situation where Muhammad could not openly prohibit the misuse of minor adopted daughters by his companions. At best, he merely issued a 'recommendation' in the name of revelation, stating that if men fear not dealing justly with their orphan daughters, they could marry up to four other women. This, however, did not adequately address the underlying issue.</p>
<p>Let us look at the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.3">4:3</a>:<br>And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls (i.e. their adopted daughters), then marry those that please you of other women, two or three or four.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why was Muhammad forced to claim the revelation of this verse?</p>
<p>The following tradition of ‘Aisha makes it clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5064">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5064</a>:<br>('Urwa narrated from ‘Aisha that she said about this verse 4:3) "O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her <strong>wealth and beauty</strong> and intends to marry her with a Mahr (i.e. money for dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr (i.e.  <strong>the foster fathers can still marry them forcefully for their wealth and beauty, but they only have to give full Mahr (i.e. Dowry) to them too</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you know that according to Islamic Sharia:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Even a breastfed small baby girl can be married, and her husband can undress her, and take every kind of sexual pleasure with her naked body (like kissing her naked body and rubbing his penis in her thighs to ejaculate</strong></em>. </li>
<li><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">As far as penetration in the vagina is concerned, the husband has to decide when the minor girl is strong enough to bear the penetration. It may be at 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 years. And if the husband makes a mistake and harms the minor girl by penetrating her vagina, still he has committed no sin or crime</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the Quran that directly says that even a minor girl (under the age of 9) can be married and penetrated.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>(<a href="http://www.quranwebsite.com/text55/065___at_talaq.html">Quran 65:4</a>) And if you are in doubt about those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, (you should know that) their waiting period is three months,<b> and the same applies to those (minor girls) who have not menstruated as yet</b>.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Modoudi's Tafseer of verse 65:4 (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=65&amp;verse=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">link</a>):</div>
<blockquote>
<div>They may not have menstruated as yet <b>either because of young age</b>, or delayed menstrual discharge as it happens in the case of some women, the waiting-period of such a woman is the same as of the woman, who has stopped menstruation, that is three months from the time divorce was pronounced.<br><b>Here, one should bear in mind the fact that according to the explanations given in the Qur'an the question of the waiting period arises in respect of the women with whom marriage may have been consummated, for there is no waiting-period in case divorce is pronounced before the consummation of marriage. (Al-Ahzab: 49). Therefore, making mention of the waiting-period for the girls who have not yet menstruated, clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl in marriage at this age but it is also permssible for the husband to consummate marriage with her. Now, obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Qur'an has held as permissible.</b></div>

<div>Imam Bukhari gave the following heading to the chapter about the marriage of Aisha:</div>
<blockquote>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId171883"></a>Islamic Logic: A woman can develop a mother-son bond with even a grown-up male by breastfeeding him</h2>
<p>Islam's logic is a<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> woman can establish a mother-son bond with a grown-up male by breastfeeding him only five times, implying that a significant emotional connection can form through this act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">However, on the other hand, Islam denies the possibility of any mother-son bond developing between a foster mother and her adopted son, even if she has been caring for him since his childhood. Despite the years of love and nurturing, this relationship is not recognized in the same way as the breastfeeding scenario.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1453a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1453a</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Sahla bint Suhail came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, I see on the face of Abu Hudhaifa (signs of disgust) on entering of Salim (who is an ally) into (our house), whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: <em><strong>Suckle him</strong></em>. She said: How can I suckle him as he is a grown-up man? Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said: I already know that he is a young man 'Amr has made this addition in his narration that he participated in the Battle of Badr and in the narration of Ibn 'Umar (the words are): Allah's Messenger <em><strong>laughed</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The human rationale makes it evident that Muhammad's ruling is flawed and unreasonable, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a woman breastfed a grown-up male man with a moustache and beard, then a mother-son bond will not develop, but only the bond of LUST and SEX can develop. </li>
<li>While it is possible for a relationship of respect to exist between a woman and a grown-up man, breastfeeding would be the most inappropriate method to achieve this purpose. Instead, natural relationships, like a sister/mother bond, can form between individuals through care and nurturing without the need for such actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, in many Muslim families living in a joint family system in countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, there is a relationship of respect between a man and the wife of his elder brother, showcasing that this kind of bond can develop without resorting to breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Even in the case of a small child being breastfed only five times, the likelihood of a strong mother-child bond developing is minimal. If a child forgets this action due to their young age, it is evident that the proposed bond would never materialize.</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Some Islam apologists claim that the act of breastfeeding Sahla performed for the grown-up man was through a cup, not directly from the breast. However, this assertion seems ridiculous, as Muhammad's <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>laughter</strong></span> in response to the incident and Sahla's <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>hesitation</strong></span> in suckling him indicate that the situation was indeed about direct breastfeeding.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId359003"></a>An excuse from an Islam apologist: Male slave becomes Mahram while the situation NEEDS it</h2>
<p>An Islam apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If women in the house are asked to do Hijab from the male slave, and if he is not considered a Mahram to the wife and daughters of his owner, then it will become impossible to take his services at home. Therefore, a male slave is declared as Mahram in Islam so that he could freely work inside the house. But no such need exists for an adopted son, as he is not required to perform household duties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>The word "<strong><em>Need</em></strong>" is only a deception here. Actually, it was the Contradictions in Sharia which compelled it to declare a male slave Mahram to all women in the house as soon as he was purchased. </p>
<p>Why can Muslims not understand the simple fact that this whole issue of the Hijab is Unnatural? This Hijab had been introduced (prior to Islam) in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Byzantine, Greek, and Persian empires in order to show the higher status of free women as compared to slave women (<a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/child-abuse-in-islam/islam-prohibited-hijab-for-slave-women-and-kept-their-breasts-naked?format=feed&amp;type=rss">link</a>). And Muhammad copied this practice from these old civilizations. </p>
<p>If the question was only about the "<strong><em>Need</em></strong>", then does Allah think a woman loses the <strong><em>Need</em></strong> of her desire to have a child upon his becoming an adult, after raising and loving him for the whole of his life? Or does Allah think that the child does not <strong><em>n</em><em>eed</em></strong> the love and care of his foster mother after becoming an adult? Actually, the poor child is not only losing his mother but his whole family including his foster father and foster sisters/brothers.</p>
<p> If Allah truly believes that a son develops a lust for his foster mother upon becoming an adult, causing the mother-child bond to vanish, while a male slave can become a guard for all women in the house without any lust, it raises serious doubts about Allah's wisdom and understanding of human nature.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Innocent Children: Why are they Called ‘Illegitimate  Bastards’ by Islam?</title>

<h2> <a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId778565"></a>Summary:</h2>
<p>Muhammad ordered that an illegitimate child will not belong to his father, but he will belong to the person on whose bed he is born, while the father has only a stone and he will have no connection with the child (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6817">Sahih Bukhari, 6817</a>)</p>
<p>Can Muslims tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the fault of this innocent child to whom Islam first declares "Wald-ul-Haram" (Bastard), and then</li>
<li>This innocent child will not be able to get the name of his father, while Sharia considers him a bastard.</li>
<li>This child cannot get the love of his father as Islam bans his father from even visiting him.</li>
<li>Due to their status as a bastard, the child receives no support or assistance from their father in terms of upbringing and education.</li>
<li>The illegitimate child will not get even any financial support from his father.</li>
<li>The child is excluded from any inheritance rights from their father.</li>
<li>If the child is a girl, she is considered a non-Mahram for her father and halfbrothers, depriving her of fatherly and brotherly love. Worse, she can be married to her halfbrothers and biological father according to Islam. </li>
<li>Islam not only separated this innocent child from his father but then Islam may also take away his mother from him by stoning (killing) her in the name of adultery (<a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity#pregnancy-of-a-virgin-slave-girl-becomes-an-evidence-of-her-fornication-even-if-she-was-raped">pregnancy becomes a proof of mother's fornication even if she was raped</a>). Thus, Islam also took away from this child the love and support of his mother too. Now the child is totally alone to face all the hardships of this world.</li>
<li>An illegitimate girl cannot marry without the permission of the Ruler, as her father cannot be her guardian.</li>
</ul>
<p>Human logic questions the rationale behind these Islamic practices: </p>
<ol>
<li>Consensual sexual activity between a man and a woman should not result in physical punishment.</li>
<li>If punishment is deemed necessary, it should be directed towards the responsible individuals rather than punishing an innocent child with the label of "Walad-ul-Haram" (Bastard).</li>
<li>Islam's punishment directly targets the child, causing undue harm to an innocent life.</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p>These rulings came from this Hadith of Muhammad:</p>
<p><a href="https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/82700">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>أنَّ رسولَ اللَّهِ صلَّى اللَّهُ عليهِ وسلَّمَ قَضى أنَّ كلَّ مُستَلحقٍ يُستَلحَقُ بعدَ أبيهِ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ ، ادَّعاهُ ورثتُهُ من بعدِهِ ، فقَضى : إن كانَ من أَمةٍ يملِكُها يومَ أصابَها فقد لَحقَ بمنِ استلحقَهُ ، وليسَ لَهُ فيما قسمَ قبلَهُ منَ الميراثِ شيءٌ ، وما أدرَكَ مِن ميراثٍ لم يُقسَمْ ، فلَهُ نصيبُهُ ، ولا يَلحقُ إذا كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ أنكرَهُ ، وإن كانَ من أَمةٍ لا يملِكُها ، أو من حرَّةٍ عاهرَ بِها ، فإنَّهُ لا يَلحقُ ولا يرثُ ، وإن كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ هوَ الَّذي ادَّعاهُ ، وَهوَ ولدُ زنًا لأَهْلِ أمِّهِ ، من كانوا ، حرَّةً ، أو أمةً</p>
<p>"The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ruled that every child belongs to the one who claims him after his father. His heirs can claim him after his death. He ruled that if the child belongs to a slave whom he possessed on the day the child was born, then the child belongs to the one who claimed him, and he has no share in the inheritance that was divided before his claim. However, he will have a share in any remaining inheritance that has not been divided. But if the father to whom he is attributed denies him (i.e. his parentage), the the child will not joined to the heirs. If the child belongs to a slave whom he does not possess, or to a free woman with whom he committed adultery, then the child will not join the heirs and will not inherit him, even if the one to whom he was attributed is the one who claimed paternity, since he was a child of fornication whether his mother was free or a slave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grade: <strong>Sahih</strong> (<a href="https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/82700">Shakir</a>)</p>
<p>In a tradition in Sahih Bukhari, Muhammad said (<a href="http://www.hadithurdu.com/01/1-3-1756/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>الْوَلَدُ لِلْفِرَاشِ وَلِلْعَاهِرِ الْحَجَرُ</p>
<p>The Prophet said: The (illegitimate) child belongs to the owner of the bed, and for the fornicator (biological father) there is only stone (i.e. nothing).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Islamic scholars explained this hadith as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The biological father of an illegitimate child will have no legal or parental rights over the child. The father cannot give his name to the child, participate in their upbringing, or have any inheritance ties with the child. In the case of an illegitimate daughter, she will be considered "Na-Mahram" (non-Mahram) to her father, requiring her to observe Hijab in his presence.</li>
<li>If an unmarried woman gives birth, the child will solely carry the mother's name.</li>
<li>If a woman accepts adultery, then the mother will be stoned.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A detailed form of this hadith is also present in Sahih Bukhari, which explains this issue in detail:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4303">Sahih Bukhari, 4303</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated 'Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) Utba bin Abi Waqqas entrusted (his son) to his brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas saying, "The son of the slave-girl of Zam'a is my (illegal) son, take him into your custody." So during the year of the Conquest (of Mecca), Sad took the boy and said, "This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me." 'Abu bin Zam's got up and said, "He is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father and was born on my father's bed." Then both of them came to Allah's Apostle and Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me."<br>Then 'Abu bin Zam'a got up and said, "This is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father." Allah's Apostle said, "O Abu bin Zam'a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born), and for the adulterer is the stone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The questions that arise in our minds are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The child is undoubtedly innocent, even if they are born out of wedlock.</li>
<li>However, why should a child be punished by being deprived of their father's name?</li>
<li>If the child takes the mother's name, society automatically identifies them as a bastard.</li>
<li>Additionally, the child is denied the love of their father, as meeting or seeing them is not allowed. For a daughter, this situation makes her a non-Mahram to her father and stepbrothers, necessitating her to observe Hijab.</li>
<li>The child receives no upbringing or financial support from the father and inherits nothing from him. Instead, they only inherit from the mother. This raises the question of whether it is fair for the child to be deprived of their father's inheritance.</li>
<li>If the mother is also stoned to death due to adultery, the child loses both biological parents and their love and care. This innocent child is bound to face numerous hardships, even though it was not his fault.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId119860"></a>According to Islam, a child will still be considered a "Bastard" even if the mother was raped</h2>
<p>This raises questions about the Divine Wisdom behind such a ruling. Even if the mother was a victim of rape and unable to provide four eyewitnesses to prove the crime, she would face lashes as punishment, and her child would also be labeled as illegitimate under Sharia law. The child would only be recognized by their mother's name, and she would be compelled to bear all the expenses of the child alone. Meanwhile, the man responsible for the rape is absolved of any responsibility to financially support the child, as per Sharia law.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId528062"></a>The offspring of slave women often fell victim to the ruling that declared them illegitimate bastards</h2>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>A Muslim master used to rape the slave woman in a "<strong>Temporary"</strong> sexual relationship and then sold her to another master, or gave her to his brother or to his slave, and all of them raped her one by one. </p>
<p>Consequently, challenges arose regarding how to handle situations where doubts emerged about the biological parentage of the child in such cases.</p>
<p>Mohammad devised a solution wherein the owner had the privilege to deny the parentage of his own child, thus declaring the own child to be an illegitimate BASTARD (Arabic: Walad-ul-Haram). </p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/82700">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>أنَّ رسولَ اللَّهِ صلَّى اللَّهُ عليهِ وسلَّمَ قَضى أنَّ كلَّ مُستَلحقٍ يُستَلحَقُ بعدَ أبيهِ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ ، ادَّعاهُ ورثتُهُ من بعدِهِ ، فقَضى : إن كانَ من أَمةٍ يملِكُها يومَ أصابَها فقد لَحقَ بمنِ استلحقَهُ ، وليسَ لَهُ فيما قسمَ قبلَهُ منَ الميراثِ شيءٌ ، وما أدرَكَ مِن ميراثٍ لم يُقسَمْ ، فلَهُ نصيبُهُ ، ولا يَلحقُ إذا كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ أنكرَهُ ، وإن كانَ من أَمةٍ لا يملِكُها ، أو من حرَّةٍ عاهرَ بِها ، فإنَّهُ لا يَلحقُ ولا يرثُ ، وإن كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ هوَ الَّذي ادَّعاهُ ، وَهوَ ولدُ زنًا لأَهْلِ أمِّهِ ، من كانوا ، حرَّةً ، أو أمةً</p>

</div>
<p>In situations where the father disowns his own child from a slave woman, the child becomes enslaved to their father. Consequently, the father gains the ability to sell his own son or daughter in the slave market for profit.</p>
<p>Mercy!  It's distressing to contemplate such a situation.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId446342"></a>Perhaps the Slave Mothers suffered the MOST:</h2>
<p>We also really feel sorry for the slave women of the past centuries in the Islamic caliphates. They had to go through 2 additional steps of hardships. According to Sharia rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was the Master's choice to accept children from their slave girls as his own children or to deny them his name as the father. In later cases, those children got the name of their mother only and became illegitimate children.</li>
<li>And the master was allowed to separate the children from the slave woman when the children got 2 teeth and sell his own son/daughter in the slave markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (also known as the younger Imam Malik) wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf">link 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117184347/http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/RISALA.htm">link 2</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر<br>A slave-mother and her baby cannot be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) till the baby get two molar teeth (The two molar teeth alway appear in a pair, at the age of 6 to 8 months)</blockquote>
<p>The anguish experienced by a mother is indescribable when her six-month-old baby is forcibly taken away from her and sold in the slave market.</p>
<p>Free women got at least the right to live with their illegitimate children, but just imagine the poor slave mothers whose children were labelled as Bastards for the whole of their life, and then even separated from her after she had fostered the child her milk for 6 months. </p>

<p>There are tons of such stories, full of cries of these daughters and sons whom Islam blames to be illegitimate. </p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId522254"></a>Problems that are occurring for innocent daughters/sons due to this so-called "Divine Wisdom"</h2>
<p>We wonder what is the <strong>wisdom </strong>of All-Wise Allah behind all this. There are so many problems occurring for the daughters and sons in the name of being Bastards (Wald-ul-Haram). For example, look at this fatwa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Fatwa No : 325114 (<a href="http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=325114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>).<br>Telling an illegitimate daughter truth about her birth<br><br>Question:<br>I am a mother who has a child out of wedlock who vaguely remembers her "biological father" when he was around. My question is: do I have to tell my daughter that she was born out of wedlock? What if she asks what happened to him, and if so, when and how does one go about explaining it?<br><br>Answer:<br>You are not Islamically obliged to tell your daughter that she was born out of wedlock (even if she gets your name and not of her father), and there is no benefit for her in doing so. Rather, it is totally against her interest.<br>If she happened to ask about her father, you are allowed to resort to <strong>tawriyah </strong>(saying something which has more than one meaning and intending a meaning different from what the listener is likely to understand). Verily, tawriyah is a legitimate way to avoid lying. You can tell her, for instance, that her father has passed away with the intention of meaning that a “legitimate” father does not exist.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One wonders how this could protect the daughter while:</p>
<ol>
<li>By carrying the name of her mother (and not her father), she and the whole society already know that she is a BASTARD child.</li>
<li><strong>Tawriyah:</strong> It seems to be another name for Islamic Taqqiyyah.</li>
</ol>
<p>But we are afraid that telling a lie is again not going to solve the problems as she is carrying the name of her mother while the passing away of her legitimate father does not stop one from carrying his name.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId845242"></a>Allah claims that an illegitimate daughter/son is a bigger evil and sinner than his/her parents</h2>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3963">Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 3963:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، ‏‏‏‏‏‏قَالَ:‏‏‏‏ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ:‏‏‏‏ "وَلَدُ الزِّنَا شَرُّ الثَّلَاثَةِ"، ‏‏‏‏‏‏وقَالَ أَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ:‏‏‏‏ لَأَنْ أُمَتِّعَ بِسَوْطٍ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِنْ أَنْ أَعْتِقَ وَلَدَ زِنْيَةٍ.<br>The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: <strong>The child of fornication is worst of the three</strong> (among father, mother &amp; child). Abu Hurayrah said that<strong> he prefers to give dirt as alms in path of Allah then freeing such illegitimate slave (due to his/her being even bigger evil and sinner than his/her fornicating parents)</strong>.<br>Imam Albani graded this Hadith as "Sahih" (<a href="https://dorar.net/h/62ed0c7cd66b093496caf211775e3f47" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercy!</p>
<p>This Hadith raises the question of wisdom behind making this innocent child highly susceptible to becoming evil later in life.</p>
<p>Some Muslim scholars argue that the reason for this possibility lies in the child's lack of education and upbringing by the father. However, this argument is difficult to accept.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there arises a counter-argument that it is Islamic Sharia itself which initially deprives this innocent child of the education and upbringing by the father. Consequently, if the child does become the worst among them, the responsibility ultimately falls upon Islam.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId167989"></a>Sunni Imams: An illegitimate Child cannot lead a congregational prayer</h2>
<p>All 4 Fiqh Imams (i.e. Malik, Abu Hanifa, Shafi'i and Ahmed bin Hanbal) say that it is not allowed for an illegitimate child to lead a congregational prayer (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200108132848/https://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/PrintFatwa.php?lang=E&amp;Id=88469&amp;lang=E&amp;Id=88469">Reference: Biggest English Fatwa Website Islamweb.org</a>). Although Imam Ahmed allows it conditionally if it is established that he is really sound in religion (while this condition does not apply to legitimate children, and they can lead prayers even if they are not sound in religion). </p>
<p>The renowned Hanafi jurist, Imam Ibn Abidin presented the following excuse (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200108131733/https://seekersguidance.org/answers/hanafi-fiqh/can-an-illegitimate-son-lead-salat/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is due to the fact that he [i.e. the illegitimate] does not [normally] have a father to raise him, train him and teach him, hence ignorance (Jahl) overcomes him [and thus, he should not lead the prayer due to his ignorance].” (Radd al-Mukhtar ala ‘l-Durr al-Mukhtar, 1/562)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is perplexing to consider how this lame excuse holds any ground when it is Islam itself that initially deprives this innocent child of the education and upbringing provided by the father. Consequently, Islam itself keeps such a child in ignorance.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId13167"></a>If a mother was non-Muslim at the time of birth, then the illegitimate child will also not inherit from the mother</h2>
<p>Please read the complete <a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/89082/status-of-child-born-out-of-wedlock">Fatwa here (link).</a> According to this Fatwa:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the mother was non-Muslim at the time of birth, then the illegitimate child will also not inherit the Mother.</li>
<li>Even if the mother accepts Islam later, still the illegitimate child will not inherit her.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please don't forget that the divine Allah has already deprived the child of the inheritance from his father. And now Allah is depriving the child of inheritance from his mother too.</p>
<p>If a Muslim father has a child with a Western mother, and that child, despite being considered illegitimate, chooses to embrace Islam, he/she will be deprived of any inheritance from both the father and the mother.</p>
<p>And all this is done while, according to Islam, that child is illegitimate.</p>
<p>What type of "divine Wisdom" and "divine Justice" is this?</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId950183"></a>A father can even marry his illegitimate daughter</h2>
<p>According to Imam Shafi'i and Imam Malik, a father can even marry his illegitimate daughter as she is non-Mahram to him.</p>
<p>Book Al-Fiqh ala al-Madhahib al-Arba'a by al-Jazairi (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161218124532/http://islamport.com/d/2/fqh/1/29/337.html?zoom_highlightsub=%ED%CA%D2%E6%CC+%C8%E4%CA%E5">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>هذا ويجوز للرجل أن يتزوج بنته المخلوقة من مائه زنا فإذا زنا بامرأة وحملت منه سفاحا وجاءت ببنت فإنها لا تحرم عليه لأن ماء الزنا لا حرمة له وكما تحل له تحل لأصوله وفروعه ولكن يكره له نكاحها بخلاف الأم الزانية فإنها كسائر الأمهات في الحرمة على أبنائهن لأن نسبه ثابت منها ويتوارثان</p>
<p>It is permissible for a man to marry his biological daughter if she was (conceived) through fornication, if he committed fornication with a woman and she got pregnant from him and gave birth to a girl then the girl is not unmarriable for him because the sperm released through fornication doesn’t make someone unmarriable, as she is marriable for him, she is also marriable for his ancestors and progeny.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-Mughni, by Imam Ibn Qadama, Volume 7 page 485 (<a href="http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1004_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_485">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ويحرم على الرجل نكاح بنته من الزنى ، وأخته ، وبنت ابنه ، وبنت بنته ، وبنت أخيه ، وأخته من الزنى . وهو قول عامة الفقهاء . وقال مالك ، والشافعي في المشهور من مذهبه : يجوز ذلك كله ; لأنها أجنبية منه ولا تنسب إليه شرعا</p>
<p>It’s not permissible for the man to marry his daughter born through adultery, or her sister, granddaughter, niece and sister and this is the statement of the scholars, but Malik and Shafiyee said that it is permissible because she is alien and does not relate to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These Fatwas emerged due to the inherent corruption within the foundation (i.e., the religion) itself.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId645657"></a>An illegitimate girl cannot marry without the permission of the Ruler</h2>
<p>The father of an illegitimate girl cannot be her guardian. Actually, an illegitimate girl has absolutely no male guardian, as she gets only the name of her mother. Thus, the Ruler will automatically become her guardian, and she cannot marry without the permission of the Ruler.</p>
<p>Please read the details in this <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/151932/who-is-the-guardian-of-an-illegitimate-daughter-when-it-comes-to-her-getting-married">fatwa of Saudi Islam Q&amp;A website</a>. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId352807"></a>Shia Madhab and injustices against Illegitimate Children:</h2>
<p>I have No Words to say against these great injustices in Shia Madhab against Illegitimate Children. Please read it yourself on their biggest Shia Website www.al-islam.org (<a href="https://www.al-islam.org/philosophy-islamic-laws-nasir-makarim-shirazi-jafar-subhani/question-15-why-illegitimate-children">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: </p>
<p><em>Why Illegitimate Children Are Kept Away From Some Posts like Jurist, Leader, Judge etc.?</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p><em>A child does not know his father, grandfather, grandmother and relatives (because Sharia does not allow the father to give child his name and to play any role in upbringing of the child). And (thus) generally many ethical, psychological, social, training, family, financially and sentimental defects come into existence because of it ...</em></p>
<p><em>Inheritance is the base for a person's future and makes the personality of an individual and prepares the ground for them for their good or bad fortune.</em></p>
<p><em>From these points we can derive the following results:</em></p>
<p><em>Illegitimate children inherit bad manners, breaking of laws and sins from their parents. For them the ground for sins and crime is more feasible. As compared to others they are more prepared for sins and if they personally get wrong training or if the environment is not good, then it is enough for them that their polluted soul, like sparks beneath the ash become fire and burn their good fortune.</em></p>
<p><em>As for the question about social posts for illegitimate persons, it is a logical precaution for the protection of social good on the basis of whatever is said above about their psychological state ...</em></p>
<p><em>When an illegitimate child is prepared to perform his duties and able to do work of training, if his deeds are good he will get rewards for it and if he does bad he will be punished.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Although the rebellious nature of illegitimate children (which have more interest and are more inclined to break the laws and commit sins) makes it difficult for them to avoid sin, and it is also difficult for them to perform their duties,</strong> but if they go against their desires and follow the orders of Almighty and right principles they will be given the best of the rewards ...</em></p>
<p><em><strong>In other words those children who are illegitimately born are like those children who are born to the parents having diseases (T.B, and sexual disorders). These children have more chances of contracting these diseases</strong> and if they are not cured as early as possible they are more likely to get these diseases.</em></p>
<p><em>Like the ill parents, illegitimate children are also prepared to break the laws and fall into crime if their training and studies are not provided in the right environment and healthy intentions. It is possible they may fall into a great depth and ally with the criminals. For those reasons, in order to protect the social cause, precautions should be taken that they remain away from some posts.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Can you ever agree with this Wisdom of Shia Madhab? </p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>One excuse put forth by Shia scholars is that these illegitimate children are more susceptible to engaging in crimes and sins due to the lack of education from their fathers. However, the reality is that it is Islamic Sharia itself that initially deprives these innocent children of receiving education from their fathers, under the label of being bastards.</p>
<p>Please see here a lot of Shia Ahadith and Fatwas that an <a href="http://ijtihadnet.com/illegitimate-children-not-allow-lead-congregational-prayer/">illegitimate child is not allowed to even lead a congregational prayer (link)</a></p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId213534"></a>Imran Khan and his alleged daughter Tyrian White:</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://sachaai.com/images/Imran-Khan-love-child1.jpg" alt="Daughter of Imran khan" width="381" height="375" loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/Imran-Khan-love-child1.jpg"></p>
<p>An Islamic society finds itself entangled in contradictions. People blame Imran Khan for not acknowledging his alleged daughter, Tyrian White, by giving her his name and fatherly love. However, the criticism should be directed towards Islam, not Imran Khan, as it is Islam that prohibits him from expressing fatherly love to his daughter. In an Islamic society, direct criticism of Islam is often avoided, leading Imran Khan to bear the burden of actions he didn't commit but are dictated by Islamic teachings.</p>
<p>Credit should be given to Imran Khan for not abandoning Tyrian and instead bringing her into the care of Jemima (his ex-wife) and his other sons. This act highlights that, without the constraints of Islamic teachings, Imran Khan might have taken full responsibility for his daughter.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Imran Khan's behavior also displays contradictions. While he proclaims his complete belief in Allah and His Sharia, he contradicts Sharia by taking care of Tyrian. Such contradictions can be seen as hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Under Sharia, it is considered a crime for Tyrian to reside under the same roof as her stepbrothers, as they are non-Mahrams. According to Sharia law, the punishment for this crime would be to lash Tyrian and her brothers.</p>
<p>These rulings of Islamic Sharia appear to lack any discernible Divine Wisdom.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId506875"></a>A Remarkable Achievement of the West: Eradicating the Suffering of Innocent Children Labeled as Illegitimate Bastards </h2>
<p>The modern non-religious West has not only abolished slavery worldwide but has also done a great favour to poor and innocent illegitimate children. And this favour is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complete eradication of the stigma of being an illegitimate bastard from innocent children.</li>
<li>Ensuring that these innocent children are granted EQUAL human rights.</li>
<li>Providing them with the love, upbringing, name, support, and inheritance they rightfully deserve.</li>
<li>Putting an end to the barbaric punishments associated with fornication, thereby saving the lives of countless innocent children. In some Islamic countries like Pakistan, mothers are tragically forced to kill their newborn children and dispose of their bodies in plastic bags in garbage dumps, all in an attempt to escape the horrific punishment of lashing or stoning (Please read our article:<a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/islam-general/58"> Killing of Newborn Babies by Their Own Mothers Due to the Fear of Draconian Islamic Punishments</a>). Conversely, in Western countries, mothers no longer live in fear of such brutal punishments, and as a result, they don't resort to such tragic actions but rather hand over their newborns to the appropriate authorities.</li>

<p>Please read the following horrible news, where you can see this Islamic Sharia Ruling in action:</p>

Social workers say she had also been repeatedly raped and burnt.<br>Fayhan al-Ghamdi admitted using a cane and cables to inflict the injuries after doubting his five-year-old daughter’s virginity and taking her to a doctor, according to the campaign group Women to Drive.<br>Rather than getting the death penalty or receiving a long prison sentence for the crime, Fayhan al-Ghamdi served only a few months in jail before a judge ruled the prosecution could only seek ‘blood money’.<br><a href="http://www.albawaba.com/news/saudi-preacher-murder-468239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albawaba News</a> reported the judge as saying: "Blood money and the time the defendant had served in prison since Lama's death suffices as punishment."<br>Fayhan al-Ghamdi, who regularly appears on television in Saudi Arabia, is said to have agreed to pay £31,000 to Lama’s mother.<br>The money is considered compensation under Islamic law, although it is only half the amount that would have been paid had Lama been a boy.<br>Despite Saudi Arabia’s famously strict legal system, Women to Drive say fathers cannot be executed for murdering their children in the country.

</blockquote>
<p>This Saudi preacher was only asked to pay the 'blood money' to the mother. Firstly, paying this much amount of blood money is nothing for this rich Saudi preacher. Secondly, this so-called 'blood money' also stays in the family. </p>
<p>Just imagine the trauma of this small girl, that her father first broke several ribs, and the bone of her left arm, burnt several parts of her body, and finally broke her skull too, but the Judge of Saudi Islamic court says that he was only 'Disciplining' the girl. </p>
<p>Do you find any logic in this so-called Divine Justice of Allah? </p>
<p>And there are two more Islamic Rulings, which are even worse than the killing of own children:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an owner kills his slave, then there is neither any physical punishment for it nor any 'blood money' for the family of the slave.</li>
<li>And if a Muslim kills a non-Muslim, still there is no physical punishment for it, but the Muslim killer only has to pay the '<strong>HALF</strong>' of blood money in this case. </li>
</ul>
<h3>All the four Sunni Imams considered these authentic Ahadith and issued Fatwas based on them</h3>
<p>Islam apologists conveniently omit the fact that the ruling derived from these Ahadith has been followed by practically all Muslims for the past 1400 years, and all four Sunni Imams have issued Fatwas in line with them.</p>

<p>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'The Hudud are not carried in the Masjid, and the father is not killed for the son."</p>
<p><strong>Commentary:</strong></p>
<p>... Secondly, if a father kills his child, then he will not be killed. The Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) details state that if a son kills his father or mother, the son will be killed in retaliation (Qisas). However, there is a disagreement among scholars when a father or mother kills their own child. Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Shafi'i, and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal are of the opinion that a father cannot be killed in Qisas in this scenario. On the other hand, Imam Malik believes that if a father kills his son by slaughtering him, then the father can also be killed in Qisas. But if the father killed the son with a sword, the father will not be killed in Qisas.</p>

<p>Therefore, practically all Muslims over the past 1400 years have followed this ruling. </p>
<p>If Islam apologists persist in denying the validity of the actual Sharia Ruling, then we must question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why was the so-called All-WISE and All-Knowing Allah incapable of clearly revealing the Sharia Rulings?</li>
<li>How can humanity follow such a deity (i.e., Allah) who lacks the ability to provide clear and unequivocal Sharia guidance, leading to nearly all Muslims in the last 1400 years being misled on this matter?</li>
</ul>
<p>Islam apologists may attempt to justify their position by pointing out disagreements in Islamic Rulings, believing it exonerates Allah from any criticism or flaws.</p>
<p>However, they are mistaken.</p>
<p>The inability of Allah to communicate clear Sharia Rulings only raises doubts about His wisdom or reveals the possibility of human error. It implies that either Allah lacks the wisdom to provide explicit guidance or Muhammad was making these Sharia Rulings himself and thus he made human mistakes.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">What is the difference between the Muslims and the Jahil (ignorant) Arabs who buried their baby daughters? Is killing a child not killing? </p>
<h2>A Muslim will not be killed for killing any Kafir</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A Muslim cannot be killed for killing a non-Muslim (Kafirs). While the punishment for killing a person from the people of the book was 'half' of the blood money as compared to a Muslim. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/87/42">Sahih Bukhari, 6903</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Ash-Shu`bi: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">I heard Abu Juhaifa saying, "I asked `Ali 'Have you got any Divine literature apart from the Qur'an?' (Once he said...apart from what the people have?) `Ali replied, 'By Him Who made the grain split (germinate) and created the soul, we have nothing except what is in the Qur'an and the ability (gift) of understanding Allah's Book which He may endow a man with and we have what is written in this paper.' I asked, 'What is written in this paper?' He replied, 'Al-`Aql (the regulation of Diya), about the ransom of captives, <strong>and the Judgment that a Muslim should not be killed in Qisas (equality in punishment) for killing a disbeliever (i.e. Kafir)</strong>."</span></p>

<p>Despite such clear injustice, still Muslims brag that Allah justly gave equal rights to non-Muslims. </p>
<p>Some Islam apologists try to deny this Islamic Ruling and claim that Abu Hanifa differed from it. Nevertheless, Abu Hanifa was himself refuted by his fellow Muslim scholars. </p>

<blockquote>
<p> …والجمهور أيضا على أنه لا يقتل مسلم بكافر ; لقوله صلى الله عليه وسلم : لا يقتل مسلم بكافر أخرجه البخاري عن علي بن أبي طالب ، ولا يصح لهم ما رووه من حديث ربيعة أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قتل يوم خيبر مسلما بكافر ; لأنه منقطع ، ومن حديث ابن البيلماني وهو ضعيف عن [ ص: 232 ] ابن عمر عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم مرفوعا . قال الدارقطني : ” لم يسنده غير إبراهيم بن أبي يحيى وهو متروك الحديث ” .</p>
<p>And according to the majority of scholars a Muslim cannot be killed for killing a Kafir. The Prophet said: "A Muslim cannot be killed for a Kafir." This is a tradition from Sahih Bukhari, which is narrated from Ali Ibn Abi Talib. And few people (like Abu Hanifa), who differed from this position, they made a mistake. These few people cite the tradition of Rabiah where the Prophet killed one Muslim for killing one non-Muslim on the day of battle of Khaibar. But this tradition is broken. An another tradition is from Ibn al-Biylmani who narrated from Ibn Umar and the prophet, but it is again a weak hadith. Imam Dar Qutni says there exists no chain of narration of this hadith, except for Ibrahim bin Abi Yahya, who is himself rejected in hadith. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, we reiterate to these Islam apologists that merely proving a "disagreement" in Islamic rulings does not absolve their Allah from faults and criticism. The question still remains: Why was the so-called All-Wise Allah unable to clearly reveal the Sharia Rulings? Why did the majority of Muslims, in this case as well, go astray and follow the Ahadith suggesting that a Muslim cannot be killed for killing a non-Muslim? The lack of clarity and consistency in such critical matters raises valid concerns about the so-called divine guidance.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response: </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong><span> Islamic Allah is not only responsible for cousin marriages but also responsible for cousin marriages </span>extending <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">Multiple Generations</span>, resulting in indeed various genetic diseases affecting innocent children. </strong></li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Additionally, the "sex-segregated" system imposed by Islamic teachings makes it nearly impossible for young boys and girls to interact and get to know each other, leading to a continued pattern of cousin marriages across multiple generations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Actually, there is no all-knowing Allah present in the heavens. And Muhammad was making the Revelations on his own. Since Muhammad was only a human (and not all-knowing), he also didn't know about the harms of cousin marriages.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In the absence of this knowledge, Muhammad found no problem in accepting the ancient Arab custom of marriage with cousins and extending it to multiple generations. </p>
<p>Based on two reports by BBC (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/4442010.stm">Report1</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/16/newsnight.shtml">Report 2</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>It is estimated that at least 55% of British Pakistanis marry their cousins, and this practice persists into the second generation.</li>
<li>According to statistics, British Pakistanis are 13 times more likely to have children with genetic disorders than the general population of Britain.</li>
<li>In Birmingham city, 10% of children born to first cousins either die in infancy or develop severe disabilities due to recessive genetic disorders.</li>
<li>Although the Pakistani community comprises only 3% of all births in Britain, they account for 33% of all British children with such disabilities. This means that if 55% of British Pakistanis have cousin marriages, then the 1.5% population of Britons who engage in first cousin marriages accounts for 33% of all British children with genetic disorders.

<li>The Universities of Bradford and Leeds together did a study in Pakistan. According to this study, 77% of all disabled Pakistani children were born due to cousin marriages. </li>

Consequently, every third family has had a disabled child with genetic disorders for the past 40 years. While the people of this city are aware of the reasons behind these issues, the practice of marrying cousins continues due to the influence of the religion of Islam.</li>

<p> </p>
<h2>Religious Indoctrination Triumphs Over Awareness:</h2>
<p>A recent scientific Study (which was done even on a bigger scale) reported (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5079102/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">link</a>) that this trend of cousin marriages has further increased in the British Pakistani community in recent years. It happened despite spreading awareness about the dangers of cousin marriages.</p>
<p>This simply means that awareness was defeated at the hands of religious indoctrination. </p>
<p>So, what are the alternatives?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we allow this situation to persist, subjecting innocent children to the severe consequences of genetic disorders and enduring a lifetime of suffering?</li>
<li>Or do we take action to mitigate this extreme human suffering by implementing laws alongside awareness campaigns?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's evident that children born with genetic disorders endure significant pain throughout their lives. If politicians truly prioritize human welfare, they must empathize with the immense suffering of these innocent children. They should not fear accusations of Islamophobia or political backlash. Instead, they should prioritize humanity above all else and make the morally sound decision. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Marriage with Cousins is also incest</h2>
<p>The rate of shared common genes among close relatives is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents/Children: 50% shared genes</li>
<li>Siblings: 50% shared genes</li>
<li>Uncle/Niece: 25% shared genes</li>
<li>Siblings (who share only one biological parent): 25% shared genes</li>
<li>First Cousins: 12.5% shared genes</li>
<li>Second Cousins: 3.125% shared genes</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Double Cousin Marriages</strong></span></span>:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span></p>
<p>Islam also allows double-cousin marriages, which genetically equate to having intercourse with one's aunt (i.e., 25% shared genes). While all Muslims would likely condemn a marriage between an aunt and her nephew (or between siblings who share one parent), unfortunately, many are unaware that their religion also sanctions such unions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why have cousin marriages become more problematic for Muslims in the present era compared to the past?</h2>
<p>In the past centuries, cousin marriages did not pose such a serious challenge for Muslims due to various factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aggressive Conquests:</strong> In the past, Muslims engaged in aggressive wars, capturing women from other nations, and fathering many children through such encounters.</li>
<li><strong>Slave Trade:</strong> Muslims would purchase slave women from markets and maintain large harems with multiple slave wives.</li>
<li><strong>Polygamy:</strong> The practice of polygamy was common, leading to multiple marriages, and many of these unions were not with cousins.</li>
</ol>
<p>These factors contributed to a situation where Muslim societies were not as severely impacted by the health risks associated with cousin marriages.</p>
<p>However, circumstances have changed in the present era:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>End of Slavery:</strong> Slavery has already been abolished, and the practice of purchasing slave women has ceased.</li>
<li><strong>Decline of Aggressive Wars:</strong> Muslims no longer engage in offensive wars, resulting in the inability to capture non-Muslim women.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Polygamy:</strong> The practice of polygamy has diminished, and Muslims now have limited opportunities to choose life partners, often leading to them selecting their cousin sisters as the first and only choice.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, cousin marriages have become a significant concern for Muslims in the present era.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Islamic teachings on hijab and modesty have contributed to the creation of a relatively isolated family system, where young boys and girls have limited interactions with each other outside of their immediate families, with the exception of interactions between cousins. This limited social interaction often leads to feelings developing between cousin boys and girls. The close-knit family system, shaped by Islamic teachings, has contributed to the prevalence of cousin marriages in Islamic societies. For many Muslim women, marrying a familiar figure, such as a cousin, can be seen as a more comfortable and secure option than marrying a complete stranger.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Strange Islam: Breastfeeding milk makes a person unlawful to marry, but cousin incest marriages does not</h2>
<p>Islam dictates that if a woman breastfeeds a male child (or an adult man) five times, then her daughter becomes a "sister," and it becomes forbidden to marry her.</p>
<p>However, modern science contradicts this notion, showing that breastfeeding a child (or an adult) five times (or even hundreds of times) does not result in genetic changes or cause genetic disorders in their progeny if they marry the daughter of that woman.</p>
<p>This practice originated from the traditions of Arab society during a time of ignorance, and Muhammad adhered to it without intervention from an All-Knowing Allah to correct the mistake.</p>
<p>It is worth reflecting on the similarity of this concept with certain aspects found in Hinduism, where cows are regarded as mothers due to drinking their milk, as described in their religious texts</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>First Excuse by Islamists: Dismissing Science as Unreliable</h2>
<p>Islamic Preachers, unfortunately, deceive both Muslims and non-Muslims by claiming that science cannot be trusted because it changes over time. In doing so, they deliberately confuse "<strong>scientific hypotheses</strong>" with "<strong>scientific facts/laws</strong>".</p>
<p>While it is true that scientific hypotheses may evolve or prove incorrect based on experimental evidence, some findings have solidified into "Scientific Facts/Laws" that are not subject to change. For instance, the fact that the Earth is a sphere, not flat, is firmly established and will not alter. Similarly, the link between cousin marriages and disabled children with genetic disorders has been scientifically proven, and this fact remains steadfast.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the value of "Scientific Facts" still pales in comparison to the overpowering influence of "Blind Belief" fostered by religious indoctrination.</p>
<h2>Second Excuse by Islamists: Propagating Fabricated Ahadith</h2>
<p>Certain Muslim apologists engage in spreading Ahadith that discourages marrying close relatives. However, it is crucial to note that these Ahadith are fabricated and cannot be found in any authentic Hadith books of Muslims. To illustrate this deception, let us reference a quote from a Muslim website itself (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150623045620/http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2011/10/07/did-the-prophet-peace-be-upon-him-discourage-marrying-cousins/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question: Did the Prophet (peace be upon him) discourage marrying relatives (ie. cousins) even though it is lawful?<br></strong><br><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>The short answer is that there are certain narrations that discourage marrying cousins, <em>yet experts of hadith verification have determined them to be extremely weak or fabricated</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrations in Question</strong></p>
<p>– “Do not marry within the family [i.e., cousins], as that leads to children that are thin and weak.”</p>
<p>– “Do not marry within the family [i.e., cousins], since the child would be born thin and weak.”</p>
<p>– “Marry outside the family, lest the offspring be thin and weak.” [Ibn Hajar, Talkhis al-Habir]</p>
<p>Regarding these and similar narrations, the 7th century hadith specialist Ibn Salah said, “I found no reliable basis for them.” Many eminent hadith masters mentioned his statement and concurred, such as Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, Ibn Mulaqqin, and others. [Ibn Hajar, Talkhis al-Habir; Ibn Mulaqqin, Khulasat al-Badr]</p>
<p>Taj al-Subki said regarding these narrations, “I found no chain of transmission (isnad) for them.” [Subki, Ahadith al-Ihya Alati La Asla Laha]</p>
<p>Hence it can be concluded that these narrations — as statements of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) — <em><strong>are fabricated.</strong></em></p>
<p>After mentioning Ibn Salah’s verdict, Hafiz Iraqi does state that it was rather <em><strong>Sayyidina Umar who made such a statement, specifically in response to a certain family/tribe whose offspring were thin and weak. He said, “You all have become thin and weak, so marry outside the family.</strong></em>” [Iraqi, Takhrij Ahadith al-Ihya’]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, there is no Hadith from Muhammad that discourages marrying within the family.</p>
<p>In fact, the historical accounts present a different scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad himself fell in love with his first cousin Umm Hani, who happened to be the daughter of Abu Talib. However, Abu Talib declined the marriage proposal as Muhammad was not only poor but also lacked skills to earn a living. Consequently, Abu Talib did not consider Muhammad to be suitable enough to marry his daughter (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220622123758/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhitah_bint_Abi_Talib#Marriage">link</a>).</li>
<li>Subsequently, Muhammad went on to marry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220622123758/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaynab_bint_Jahsh">Zainab bint Jahsh</a>, who was his cousin-sister. </li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding Umar's statement, it's important to note that he neither held the authority of Allah nor was he a prophet, thus his words do not constitute a part of Sharia.</p>
<p>Umar's suggestion was based on a common observation from ancient times that marrying strong women tended to produce stronger offspring, while marrying weak women led to weaker children. Consequently, when Umar noticed that the tribe of al-Sa'ib was becoming physically weaker, he specifically advised them to marry individuals who were more intelligent and stronger than themselves (had the people of al-Sa'ib been stronger, Umar would not have made this suggestion to them). Therefore, this was an exceptional case and not a general recommendation in Islamic Sharia. Sharia does not have a universal mandate to marry outside the family.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some Muslim apologists present the following argument (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220622123758/https://shamela.ws/book/17100/17">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>عن الشافعي قال: أيما أهل بيت لم يخرج نساؤهم إلى رجال غيرهم كان في أولادهم حمق. </p>
<p>Al-Shafi’i said, “Whenever the people of a household do not allow their women to marry men outside of their line, there will be fools among their children.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more, it is important to clarify that this saying attributed to al-Shafi'i is not a part of Sharia. Instead, it reflects a common observation among people during that era that marrying within the family could lead to health issues in the offspring. As a matter of fact, even Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani, another renowned Muslim scholar, rejected its inclusion in Islamic Sharia, and he wrote (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220622123758/http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1800_%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%AC-%D9%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_116">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وأما قول بعض الشافعية يستحب أن لا تكون المرأة ذات قرابة قريبة فإن كان مستندا إلى الخبر فلا أصل له أو إلى التجربة وهو أن الغالب ان الولد بين القريبين يكون أحمق</p>
<p>The saying of some Shafi'i scholars suggests that it is preferable for a woman not to be closely related in kinship. However, this is not based on Hadith, it has no basis, and it is only be based on observation, which assumes that children born from close relatives tend to be less intelligent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, Islamic Sharia does not offer any recommendation to avoid incestuous marriages with cousins.</p>
<h2>Third Excuse by Islamists: Genetic Testing is Enough and Cousin Marriages Should Not Be Banned</h2>
<p>Today, Islamic apologists claim that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cousin marriages should not be banned as genetic testing corrects the risk of cousin marriages. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response:</strong></span></p>
<p>Would Muslims allow marriage between siblings and Uncle/Niece too if such genetic tests approve it?</p>
<p>The rate of shared common genes among close relatives is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Siblings: 50% shared genes</li>
<li>Uncle/Niece: 25% shared genes</li>
<li>Siblings (who share only one common parent): 25% shared genes</li>
<li>First Cousins: 12.5% shared genes</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, people who are carriers of genetic diseases have no family history of recessive genetic conditions. The absence of family history does NOT decrease risk.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, there is no way to test for absolutely everything. Some recessive genetic conditions are extremely rare and potentially exclusive to your family that a normal carrier screening panel cannot detect.</p>
<p>Comprehensive genetic testing could not identify the cause. This means they would not have tested positive on carrier screening. This also means we cannot test future pregnancies to see if they are affected, we just have to monitor with ultrasound and see what happens knowing that there is a 25% risk in each pregnancy. It’s very likely that the couple carries one of these very rare genetic changes that is unique to their family and that we are unable to detect with our current technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Conclusion: </h2>
<p>There is no All-Knowing Allah present in the heavens; rather, it was Muhammad himself who established this religion based on his own beliefs and practices. He adhered to the traditions of the ignorant Arabs during that era. Consequently, for all the innocent children born with genetic disorders as a result of cousin marriages (extending multiple generations), Muhammad bears responsibility for their suffering.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This notion is a misleading narrative that parents have the unrestricted right to enforce their religious beliefs, rituals and customs onto their children.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Children are not their <strong>property</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Parents are free to teach <strong>morals</strong> to their children. Parents are also free to share <strong>information</strong> about their <strong>religion</strong> and <strong>culture</strong> with their children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">However, there is a difference between sharing information, and imposing information. Imposing information leads to brainwashing and i</span>ndoctrination, which involves forcing someone to accept a set of beliefs without critical thinking. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">To illustrate, imposition involves asserting to children that their birth into a Muslim/Christian family automatically designates them as followers of that religion. Then this imposition goes to the next step, where parents impose "religious practices/duties" upon their children (like praying 5 times a day). And then religious customs (like circumcission or wearing the Hijab) are also imposed on kids. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Kids cannot give their informed consent for religion,<strong> <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">just like they cannot give their informed consent for marriage</span></strong>. So, why then impose religion on them by telling them that they have by default become a follower of a certain religion just by getting a birth into a family which follows that particular religion? No, but religion is a personal right of children, about which they have to make an informed decision only after turning 18,<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong> just like in the case of marriages they have to make such an informed decision themselves only after turning 18</strong></span>.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just as it is both illegal and morally questionable for parents to coerce their children into marriages, it is similarly unacceptable for parents to enforce their religious preferences and practices on their offspring.</p>
<p>The undeniable proof of religious indoctrination in children is evident through the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A child born into a Hindu family inherently embraces Hinduism.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A child born into a Christian family automatically identifies as a Christian.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A child born into a Muslim family also adheres to Islam.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">HINDERANCE</span> of a child's <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">CAREER PATH</span> due to any religious doctrine/activity is a <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">CRIME</span></h2>
<p>Japan already classifies <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">HINDERANCE</span> of a child's <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">CAREER PATH</span> due to any religious doctrine/activities as a crime.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/forced-participation-in-religious-activities-to-be-classified-as-child-abuse-in-japan">Forced participation in religious activities to be classified as child abuse in Japan</a></strong></p>
<p>... The law stipulates four types of abuse: physical, sexual, neglect and psychological.</p>
<p><strong>Inciting fear by telling children they will go to hell if they do not participate in religious activities</strong>, or preventing them from making decisions about their career path, is regarded as <strong>psychological abuse</strong> and neglect in the guidelines.</p>
<p>Other acts that will constitute neglect include not having the financial resources to provide adequate food or housing for children as a result of making large donations, <strong>or blocking their interaction with friends due to a difference in religious beliefs</strong> and thereby undermining their <strong>social skills</strong>.</p>
<p>When taking action, the guidelines will urge child consultation centres and local governments to pay particular attention to the possibility that children may be unable to recognise the damage caused by abuse after being influenced by doctrine-based thinking and values.</p>
<p>In addition, there are concerns that giving advice to parents may cause the abuse to escalate and bring increased pressure from religious groups on the families. In the light of this, the guidelines will call for<strong> making the safety of children the top priority and taking them into temporary protective care without hesitation</strong>.</p>
<p>For children 18 years of age or older and not eligible for protection by child consultation centres, local governments should instead refer them to legal support centres, welfare offices and other consultation facilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This legislation does not portray Japan as an authoritarian state seeking to intrude into private family matters. Rather, it is enacted solely for the <strong>protection</strong> of children against "<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>authoritarian parents</strong></span>". The State must interfere even in the <strong>private lives </strong>of families for the following 4 cases of abuse of children:</p>
<ol>
<li>Physical abuse</li>
<li>Sexual abuse</li>
<li>Abuse of Neglection and</li>
<li>Psychological Abuses to indoctrinate children and imposition of religion and religious activities upon them forcefully. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2>Religious Practices: A Nightmare for Kids</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We invite you to please also visit our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/">exmuslim Subreddit</a> and read stories about how we (ex-Muslims) had to perform daily prayer obligations five times a day, attend Quran school six days a week, and spend multiple hours each day studying and committing the Quran to memory. Imagine the overwhelming sense of oppression that children experience when forced to adhere to these rigid routines without respite.</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider the plight of young girls who are coerced into wearing the Hijab, even if they personally object to it. Families with strong religious beliefs often impose this attire on their daughters beginning at the tender age of two of three. This constant requirement can feel suffocating, especially when compared to the temporary inconvenience many experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic when masks were mandatory. Yet, these girls face the burden of donning the entire Hijab every single day. The lives of ex-Muslim girls are really miserable as they are forced to marry Muslim men and provide them with sexual services for the whole of their lives. The worst part is, they have to raise their own children as Muslims against their wishes.</p>
<p>Islam demands Muslim parents to <strong>FORCE</strong> their children to offer prayers and to <strong>BEAT</strong> them if they don’t offer their prayers at the age of 10 years. Although the Western States have already banned the beating of children, however, this is not enough. They should also ban parents from enforcing daily prayers or the Hijab even by using methods other than beating (like influencing them by shaming, bullying, blackmailing, harassment etc.).</p>
<p>Consider the hardship a child has to endure to fast the whole day. It is not only the pressure from parents, but the whole Islamic community exerts indirect pressure. </p>
<p>There was a recent incident in the UK about <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dd6a92b8-5502-4448-b001-55d18d6bad93?shareToken=f3f0f3680d90132929b08b7832ae1cdd">lady principal Katharine Birbalsingh who had to ban Muslim kids from praying in school</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because some religious kids were bullying other Muslim kids to join them in prayers. And if they didn't then they faced violence and bullying. </li>
<li>And those religious Muslim kids were also bullying girls to wear the Hijab. And if they didn't then they were guilt-tripped and they faced intimidation and harassment.</li>
</ul>
<p>This shows not only parents but also religious societies are in a position to bully and exercise extreme pressure on children.</p>
<p>Therefore, the question remains how to successfully save children from this pressure from their religious families, communities and even friends? It is impossible to find out if any kid is doing it on his own, or under the pressure of family or friends. The only way to achieve it is to ban any religious practices for children. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Difficulties in getting rid of Religious Indoctrination even after becoming an Adult</h2>
<p>I was born into a Muslim family and from a young age, my religious parents indoctrinated me with the belief that homosexuality was worse than having sex with mother and sister, and that homosexuals are the worst creatures in Allah's eyes.</p>
<p>Later in life, I left Islam. However, despite leaving the religion, I found that I still harbored deep-seated hatred against homosexuals. Even though scientific evidence convinced me that homosexuality is natural for some people, I couldn't shake off my disdain.</p>
<p>It took many more years for me to finally overcome this prejudice against homosexuals. This experience taught me a "<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>very important lesson</strong></span>" that even making an informed, conscious decision "<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>later</strong></span><strong>"</strong> isn't enough to undo the indoctrination instilled from childhood. Therefore, any religious indoctrination against homosexuals should be stopped right from the beginning. </p>
<p>Please also think about the homosexual children in Muslim families. At present, their Muslim parents are given full liberty to indoctrinate them against homosexuality, and telling them that Allah will punish homosexuals severely as they are the worst creatures. But when nature drives these Muslim children towards homosexual behaviour, then they become totally confused and afraid and they have to face a huge mental torture. </p>
<p>In the next step, when these children exhibit behaviour that is perceived as homosexual, their Muslim parents attribute it to demonic possession and bring them to Islamic scholars who exercise Islamic Exorcisms. This approach places immense psychological strain on vulnerable children, amounting to a form of abuse that should be immediately stopped by the State. Yes, parents should not be given so much control over children that they bring such psychological harm to them. </p>
<p>The process of protecting children from such religious indoctrination is the same, i.e. to openly declare it a crime to indocrtinate children:</p>
<ul>
<li>The state should openly educate children that homosexuals have equal human rights and deserve the same respect as people of all religions and races.</li>
<li>The state should clearly inform children that if their parents tell them to hate homosexuals because Allah hates them, it is a CRIME.</li>
<li>The state should clearly inform children that if their parents prevent them from meeting and socializing with homosexual peers, it is a CRIME.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:67">Ex-Muslim Girls Can't Get Rid of the Hijab Despite Leaving Islam</h2>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:670">There is a platform for ex-Muslims called "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim">exmuslim subreddi</a>t". When I first visited this platform, I was extremely surprised when an ex-Muslim girl posted a piece of writing. According to her, despite leaving Islam, she is not able to get rid of the hijab, and going out in public without the hijab has become a nightmare for her. She has a strong desire to wander around without the hijab because she feels suffocated in the hijab, but when she takes off the hijab, she feels like she has become naked in public. Because of this, she is facing severe psychological pressure. And she seeks advice from other ex-Muslim girls on how to overcome this psychological terror.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:345">At first, I couldn't believe that post. I thought that maybe the girl was joking. In my opinion, what could be a more difficult task than leaving Islam, for which even while taking the opposition of the whole society, the brainwashing of childhood is abandoned. So then, compared to leaving Islam, what problem can there be in leaving the hijab.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:341">But I was wrong. After further research, it was found that the girl is not alone, but there were countless stories of ex-Muslim girls on that platform who were saying the same thing that despite leaving Islam, they were not able to leave the hijab and had gone into such severe psychological pressure that they had to consult a psychiatrist.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:115">Although I am also an ex-Muslim, but being a man, I cannot even imagine the difficulties that ex-Muslim girls face.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:418">The lesson is once again clear: it is very difficult to abandon the teachings of childhood despite being an adult. The psychological effect of religious teachings can be powerful and long-lasting, getting rid of which can be extremely difficult and a painful process. Therefore, the good of humanity lies in not allowing children to be targeted by these things from childhood and providing them protection through law.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Conclusion: </h2>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="background-color: #fdfeda;">Children are fully allowed to get information about any religion. Similarly, parents are also allowed to share information about their religion and culture. There is no problem with it.</span></li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="background-color: #fdfeda;">So, getting <strong>information</strong> about religion is not banned, or even accepting it also not banned (i.e. children may accept any faith on their own before 18), but ONLY <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">PRACTICING</strong></span> it is banned till the age of 18. <span style="color: #0000ff;">Neither parents have the authority to make children <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>practice</strong></span> a religion nor children are allowed to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">practice</strong></span> it on their own</span>.</span></li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="background-color: #fdfeda;">This restriction parallels the notion that children may develop romantic feelings for someone, including an adult, which is not deemed a crime. However, engaging in sexual activities with an adult is prohibited until the age of 16, and marriage is not permitted until the age of 18.</span></li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="background-color: #fdfeda;">This protection for children is enough that they get AWARENESS that parents cannot enforce their religion and religious practices upon them, just like they cannot enforce upon them a spouse of their choice. But sharing information and personal opinions about any potential future spouse with them is fully ok.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Excuse: How are you going to POLICE it?</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>There are 2 issues here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hidden enforced religious practices on children inside the house</li>
<li>Openly enforced religious practices on children in public</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as the first issue of hidden enforced practices inside the house is concerned, then it is the same as a child's beating inside the house. Either the child is himself able to report such enforcement of religious practices, or his siblings or relatives or friends or neighbours can report it.</p>
<p>As far as openly enforced religious practices are concerned, like enforcing children to go to mosques and pray, or going to Madrassahs is concerned, then they can be easily controlled. Similarly, enforcing the Hijab on small girls in public can also be easily controlled.</p>
<h2>Excuse: How can a State stop Muslim children who want to fast or wear the Hijab on their own?</h2>
<p>An Islamic apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Many children with religious beliefs will want to practice their beliefs before 18.There is nothing you can do without becoming an authoritarian regime and taking people's freedoms away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Since we don't know if parents have enforced anything upon children or not, the STATE has more rights over a child in such a situation.</p>
<p>For example, if a 9-year-old girl wants to marry an old man, then the State gets the full right to prohibit such a marriage, and it is not counted as an authoritarian regime, or taking away the people's freedom.</p>
<p>Even after maturity at the age of 12 years, the state neither allows kids to marry on their own nor allows parents to wed them. </p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, kids are allowed to like (or even love) any person of their choice (even if he/she is an adult). Still, they are not allowed to be involved in sexual activities with that person. They have to wait till they are 16 years old for sexual activity with an adult. And they have to wait till 18 to marry the person of their liking</span>. Similarly, kids are fully allowed to like the religion of their parents and to read about that religion. But children are not allowed to PRACTICE the religion and its rituals till they are 18. </strong></span></p>
<p>Neither a State bans marriage nor religion. But for children, the States have the full right to ban marriage as well as religious practices till they become adults of 18 years of age to make sure that they are not harmed.</p>
<h2>Excuse: It is an Injustice against Muslim parents</h2>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>It is not an injustice against Muslim parents specifically because the ban applies equally to all parents regardless of their religious affiliation. </p>
<p>This ban does not include ONLY Muslim parents, but ALL parents. This means Atheists, ex-Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus etc. all of them are banned from indoctrinating their children and imposing their ideology/religion and its practices upon children. </p>
<p>One Islamic apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is unjust, while atheists have no rituals. Thus such a law will only affect Muslim/Christian/Jewish families</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If these religions are authoritarian and wrongfully impose their rituals on small children then atheist parents are not responsible for their wrongdoings.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The rule is only one, i.e. religion and religious rituals cannot be imposed on children. Blame these religions, not this rule or atheist parents. </p>
<h2>Excuse: It sounds like an Authoritarian State </h2>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>It's not authoritarian to <strong>protect </strong>children from the imposition of religion and religious rituals. The state is only <strong>protecting</strong>, and not <strong>imposing </strong>anything on children. </p>
<p>True authoritarianism occurs when parents are allowed to dictate their beliefs to their children and impose its rituals upon them forcefully, denying them the chance to explore and choose their path. Forcing children to adhere to certain religious practices, such as attending Madrasa or reciting the Quran, against their will is a violation of their human rights. Similarly, forcing girls to wear the Hijab and Abaya is also a form of authoritarianism.</p>
<p>These are double standards when the state is wrongfully blamed for being authoritarian only for protecting children's rights, but they altogether neglect the authoritarianism of religious parents who impose their religion and rituals on children. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong>They are only resorting to fear-mongering tactics against the state (Statephobia) merely to justify and perpetuate their practice of child abuse for the sake of religion.</strong> Similar concerns about civil liberties were raised to oppose the legislation against child beating. During that period, there were claims that the state would abuse such laws. Fortunately, rational individuals did not heed these weak arguments and went ahead to prohibit child beating.</span></p>
<h2>Excuse: State control of people's lives is the reason where the genocide begins</h2>
<p>Another Islamic apologist made the following allegation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The state coming into folks homes and policing their thoughts, their speech, their interactions with their family will lead to State control of people's lives. This is how genocide starts. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is a flawed allegation.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The State is not controlling the people's lives here, but it is only protecting that the child's life and thoughts and speech is controlled in an authoritarian way by the religious parents. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That is why the State comes to the homes and protects children against beating and physical abuse by authoritarian parents, and no genocide occurred due to this, but the result was only the positive outcome, where beating of children was reduced many folds and people indeed learned the law and how to abide by it.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That is why the Japanese State identified the 4 issues, where there exists no privacies of families, i.e.:</p>
<ol>
<li>Physical abuse</li>
<li>Sexual abuse</li>
<li>Abuse of Neglection and</li>
<li>Psychological Abuses to indoctrinate children and impose religion and religious activities upon them forcefully. </li>
</ol>
<p>In these cases, the allegations of privacy breach, policing, genocide etc. are only used by religious elements to protect abuses of religious parents against their kids. </p>
<p>We repeat:  <span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong>They are only employing the tactic of fear-mongering against the state (Statephobia) to defend and continue their practice of child abuse for the sake of religion.</strong></span></p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Why stop at religion? Why not ban politics for children</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Of course, children should not be involved in politics till the age of 18, till they can make informed decisions on their own.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That is why, there already exists an age limit of 18 for voting.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islamic preachers are strange. They want a person to do a PhD degree first before leaving Islam. But how can they then bring small children into the domain of Islam without their informed decisions?</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Excuse: How can children be left alone at home when parents go to mosque or church?</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">One Islamic preacher objected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You can’t realistically ban a parent from taking their kid with them to the Mosque or whatever other religious service. Parents have to go places and the kids have to come with them. It’s just a simple fact of life that children have to be dragged along with their parents wherever their parents go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Firstly, if parents are going to watch a scary movie in a cinema, then they also don't take their children with them but make an alternative arrangement for their children. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Secondly, even if parents have to drag children along with them, then they should not compel children to pray along with them. Mosques or churches can also offer separate places for children. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The goal is not to eliminate all hurdles but to eliminate major child abuses like compelling children to go to Quran madrasas or to offer 5 prayers daily, or to compel girls to wear the Hijab etc. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Regarding minor issues, it may be enough to issue a guideline for parents. But such minor issues should not be misused as an excuse to reject this law altogether, and to make even major abuses legal for parents to impose their religion and all rituals on children.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Similarly, another Islamic preacher objected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">How can you differentiate between religious practice and culture? Are you going to make it illegal to give gifts on Christmas?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Firstly, since when does giving gifts come under the imposition of religious rituals? Is it an obligatory religious ritual in Islam or Christianity to give gifts? Even people of other religions can also give you gifts on Eid and Christmas and Diwali etc.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Secondly, the answer is the same. We are not living in a 100% perfect world. It is enough if laws serve the purpose of stopping the major abuses, which are like compelling girls to wear the Hijab in public, or compelling kids to go to Quran Madrassas or circumcision of male children etc.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even simply educating children that parents are not allowed to impose religion or religious rituals is enough to bring big changes and stop major child abuse. </p>
<h2>Excuse: We indeed enjoyed going to Church or Mosques as kids</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A Muslim wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">My fondest memories are of my father taking me to different mosques on friday and having an imam come over to teach me the principles of our faith. I also enjoyed Ramadan fasting. We are a ‘secular’ family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And one Christian wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I've gone to church willingly and unwillingly as a kid and honestly its not bad imo at least, just boring sometimes. We even sing songs about Jesus when we run around the Christmas tree and every child participates in that. Should you not be allowed to do that? </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In simple words, there is no harm in celebrating the Christmas and Eid festivals or getting gifts. But the participation in religious activities should be banned for children by law, as they may be used for religious indoctrination of many children. <strong>Even if some of you belong to secular religious families and you have good memories of going to the church/mosque as children, this practice should still be banned <span style="color: #ff0000;">for the sake of millions of other vulnerable children</span>.m</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Please also remember that Secular parents also take their children to other recreational activities like swimming, camping, dancing classes, painting classes etc. and they also cause enjoyment and become some of the fondest memories.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Excuse: It is against the PRIVACY of families to be punished for things that are not harmful</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Of course, these are harmful practices, when:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A child is forcefully circumcised. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A child is forcefully compelled to go to the Quran school and to pray five times a day, and fast. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A girl is forcefully compelled to take the Hijab and Abaya against her will. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When a kid is taught hate speech.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When a kid is pressured to enter in faith of his parents and all other choices are blocked for him. </li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">At present, parents are fully in a position to influence and impose their DEMANDS upon children forcefully, and there are consequences for children if they don't fulfil their demands. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There are tons of evidence and thousands of witnesses present in the stories of ex-Muslims (on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/">Exmuslim Subreddit</a>), when girls didn't wear the Hijab, or didn't go to Quran school, or said that they didn't want to be Muslim, then their parents made them suffer in one way or the other (if not physically, then mentally they abused their children). Or what homosexual children have to endure in a religious family, is horrible. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When it comes to the rights of children, then there is already no privacy involved. The State of Japan has already identified those four issues, where the so-called privacy of family doesn't matter as this privacy is only misused to protect child abuse. These four issues are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Physical abuse</li>
<li>Sexual abuse</li>
<li>Abuse of Neglection and</li>
<li>Psychological Abuses to indoctrinate children and impose religion and religious activities upon them forcefully. </li>
</ol>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If parents are not allowed to beat children privately at home, then forcing them to learn the Quran and to pray five times at home privately should also be a crime and investigated upon report.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The state is not enforcing anything upon the children, but it is prohibiting the parents from imposing and enforcing abuses upon their children as if children are their private property.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Excuse: It is impossible to implement it while Religious communities will bitterly oppose it</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Where there is a will, there is a way.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Yes, it seems a difficult task at the moment, but remember that it was also seen as an impossible task when the French Government first decided to ban the Hijab and all other religious symbols in schools. But then the French Government and French people proved us wrong, and indeed they found a way to implement it.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We also see that the Tajik Government also made such a law. Please read: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110804055624/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/tajikistan-bans-minors-from-entering-mosques-and-makes-study-at-secular-schools-mandatory/2011/08/03/gIQAZ48QrI_story.html">Tajikistan bans minors from entering mosques and makes study at secular schools mandatory</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Similarly, it was considered an impossible task to ban child beating in the beginning. But then such laws were made and indeed successfully implemented. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We have the arguments and morality on our side, and we can indeed succeed in protecting the rights of children. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And yes, religion needs indoctrination to survive. If they rely on 18-year-olds as new followers, then most probably religions will die. But this is not our concern if a religion lives or dies. If religious people think that their religion is the best, then it should have the ability to attract 18-year-old people too. </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Excuse: We lack the funds to implement a law that may not achieve complete success</h2>
<p>An objection was raised that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The children's services / foster care situation in America is just tragic. We can't even properly deal with horrible sexual abuse, physical abuse, and neglect. The sad reality is... In most cases, the children have a choice between their horrible religious situation, and equally horrible or worse group homes, foster parents scamming the system, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Despite encountering financial limitations in the practical implementation of this law, it does not deter us from actively promoting '<strong>awareness'</strong> about its existence.</p>
<p>Initially, complete enforcement of the law against parents beating their children posed challenges. However, as awareness continued to spread, parents became informed. Consequently, incidents of child abuse gradually decreased. Eventually, we reached a stage where substantial funds were no longer essential for the enforcement of this law.</p>
<p>Another Islamic apologist argued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to try to create a utopia, better clean up all the gray space, and make it all work in black and white. Otherwise, it is only a waste of lot of money. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we tell them that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">No, we are not religious people who believe their God to be 100% perfect, and thus their God also created a 100% perfect world.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">No, we don't believe in 100% perfect Utopia. No, we don't believe that things have to be 100% black and white. </li>
</ul>
<p>We live in a non-perfect and flawed world. We make decisions based on what is "more" beneficial and what is "less" beneficial. Or what is "more" harmful and what is "less" harmful.</p>
<p>Thus, even if such laws fail to 100% eliminate the physical, sexual and religious abuses of children, still they should be supported as they indeed bring a lot of good to society and provide protection to children to a great extent. </p>
<p>Please also watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwgmcu2UWn0">video</a> of Dr. Dawkins, which will make this issue clear. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://themedialine.org/by-region/facing-religious-backlash-pakistans-first-human-milk-bank-temporarily-shuts-down/#:~:text=After%20religious%20scholars%20declared%20the,a%20governmental%20body%20in%20Pakistan."><span>Pakistan’s first human milk bank temporarily suspended operations on Saturday following severe criticism from religious circles</span></a></p>
<p><span>Islamic scholars say that the initiative goes against the Islamic concept of “milk kinship” and creates problems for family law,</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/urdu/articles/ckddd0jgq51o">Islamic Fatwa: Only Muslim mothers' milk will be provided to Muslim babies</a> (i.e. even milk of animals like cow and goats is acceptible, but the milk of a non-Muslim mother is not acceptable in Islam). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breastfeeding does not alter DNA.</li>
<li>Therefore, no genetic diseases will occur if so-called foster siblings marry each other.</li>
<li>They are actually more protected against genetic diseases compared to the cousin marriages common in Islam. Cousins share 12.5% common genes, but the so-called foster siblings share no common genes despite hundreds of times of breastfeeding the same woman. </li>
<li>Additionally, no sibling bond develops among infants who drink the milk of the same woman. However, a significant sibling bond exists in cousin marriages among Muslims.</li>
</ul>
<p>This concept (i.e. breastfeeding the milk of same woman make you siblings) originated from the traditions of Arab society during a time of ignorance, and Muhammad adhered to it without intervention from an All-Knowing Allah to correct the mistake.</p>
<p>It is worth reflecting on the similarity of this concept with certain aspects found in Hinduism, where cows are regarded as mothers due to drinking their milk, as described in their religious texts.</p>
<h2>Why mother's Milk is the only option?</h2>
<p>Pakistan is among the countries with the highest infant mortality rates. According to UNICEF statistics, 54 out of every 1,000 newborns die. Under the SDG goals, Pakistan has committed to reducing this rate to 12 per 1,000.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization recommends that all children be exclusively breastfed for the first six months and continue breastfeeding along with complementary foods up to the age of two years. Premature and low-birth-weight babies who are fed anything other than mother's milk face health complications and an increased risk of infections, which can lead to death. Therefore, it is crucial to provide mother's milk to save the lives of these newborns.</p>
<h2>Muhammad adopted the practice of Milk Kinship from his Arab Pagan Culture</h2>
<p>The Bible (Jews and Christians) or Magians, Hindus etc. didn't practice any milk kinship. But this concept was present in pre-Islam Arab culture of the time of ignorance. </p>
<p>And Muhammad copied this practice from them. </p>
<p>Remember, no changes occur in DNA due to breastfeeding the same woman (or due to drinking milk from the same cow). </p>
<p>However, there are 12.5% common genes between first cousins, but Islam still allowed this incestuous marriage. </p>

        <p>It is often claimed that the Islamic system of the Hijab and gender-based segregation causes extreme sexual frustration among Muslim men. That is why Muslim countries are ahead in watching porn films on the internet.</p>
<p>However, Islamic preachers deny it. They call it only false propaganda against Islam and Muslims. And they come up with this argument:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2022-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Pornhub's official statistics for the top 20 countries in 2020.</a> show that the only Islamic country Egypt just barely managed to enter the top 20s last year for the first time. The USA is at #1 far outpacing the other countries on the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>It is due to the reason while Islamic countries have already banned porn websites. Therefore, Muslims in these Islamic countries reach these porn websites only through VPN, where their IP address is changed from their original Islamic country to a non-Muslim country.</p>
<p>Here is a report by <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.bbc.com/urdu/interactivity/debate/story/2006/01/060116_reba_diary1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BBC Urdu</a> (from the year 2006) that 45% of Internet traffic from Pakistan went to porn websites daily. <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Google Trends</a> also showed that Islamic countries were at the top for searching for different types of porn films. </p>
<p>After 2010, almost all Islamic countries started banning access to porn websites. After the ban, the trend didn't stop, and people in Islamic countries started using VPNs to watch porn films, but it became impossible to calculate the data on the basis of the IP addresses of Islamic countries. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Google Trends</a> show that Islamic countries (still today) are at the top for searching porn-related searches. </p>
<p>For example, Pakistani Muslim men have been at the top of the list for the last 2 decades in search of incest terms like:</p>

<h2>Logical Arguments for Extreme Sexual Frustration in Islamic Societies</h2>
<p>Muslim men often experience great frustration due to the restrictions imposed on natural interactions between men and women in the name of Hijab and Islamic modesty.</p>
<p><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.</strong></p>
<p>That is why, even girls with Hijab are still harassed and molested in Islamic countries. </p>
<h2>The hijab didn't stop Muhammad from becoming sexually aroused</h2>
<p>Mohammad once called a presumably fully clothed woman in Medina a devil for just existing and became sexually aroused after seeing her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1403a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sahih Muslim, 1403a</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p>Jabir reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw a woman, and so he came to his wife, Zainab, as she was tanning a leather and had sexual intercourse with her. He then went to his Companions and told them: The woman advances and retires in the shape of a devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please think about it: Why did the Hijab fail to make Muhammad safe from being sexually aroused? </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Companions of Muhammad were unable to abstain from illegal sex for only 30 nights of Ramadan and they sinned. How can Muslim youth avoid sinning until they are 30 years old (until they get married)?</h2>
<p>Firstly, Muhammad told Muslims that Allah made sex with wives Haram during the nights of the month of Ramadan. </p>
<p>But this order of Sharia was totally against “Human Nature”. Even Sahaba (who were beacons of light and Eman) were not able to act upon this unnatural order of Sharia. Thus, they secretly started going to their wives during the nights of Ramadan. </p>
<p>Thereupon Muhammad realized his mistake, and in order to correct it, he made the drama of revelation of Quranic verses once again, which then permitted Sahaba to have sex with their wives even during the nights of Ramadan. </p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p>Surah Al-Baqarah (2:187)“<em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting). They are Libas (i.e., body-cover, or screen) for you and you are Libas for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves (by going to wives secretly), so He turned to you and forgave you (for this sin). So now you are allowed to have sexual relations with your wives.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/urn/178360" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sahih Bukhari, 4508</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p>Narrated Al-Bara': When the order of compulsory fasting of Ramadan was revealed, the people did not have sexual relations with their wives for the whole month of Ramadan, but some men cheated themselves (by violating that restriction). So Allah revealed: "Allah is aware that you were deceiving yourselves but He accepted your repentance and forgave you..".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Sahaba (who were the beacons of light and faith) were unable to control themselves for 30 nights, how can Muslim parents expect their young boys to abstain from sin until the age of 25 to 30 years (which is the average age of marriage for boys in Islamic countries today)?</p>
<p>Islamic apologists present this excuse that Muslim youth should FAST, as Muhammad prescribed to fast to overcome sexual urges.</p>
<p><span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong>But Muhammad was wrong that FASTING will take away sexual urges. The proof is that the companions of Muhammad were already fasting during the month of Ramadhan, still they were unable to control their sexual desires for only 30 nights, and they sinned.</strong></span></p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, <i>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 13h:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:<br>I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I am a young man and I am afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse and I cannot afford to marry." He kept silent, and then repeated my question once again, but he kept silent. I said the same (for the third time) and he remained silent. Then repeated my question (for the fourth time), and only then the Prophet said, "O Abu Huraira! The pen has dried after writing what you are going to confront. So (it does not matter whether you) get yourself castrated or not."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muslim societies have no other way to save their children from sins, except for marrying them just after they become adults. But practically, it is almost impossible in today's world. It was not even possible in the earlier times when due to poverty Prophet Muhammad got married at the age of 25 and Abu Huraira was also poor and was not able to marry a woman. </p>
<p>Moreover, Sahaba were even unable to abstain from sin during the short period of the wars:</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, <i>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 13o:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated 'Abdullah:<br>We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Apostle and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, "Shall we get ourselves castrated?" He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract </p>

<h2>Dead bodies of girls are taken out of their GRAVES and raped in Islamic Pakistan</h2>
<p>The frustration among Pakistani Muslim men has reached an appalling level, to the extent that even the corpses of women are violated after being taken out of their graves (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBtSvH7ps63b4wIFsRwMyt_b-Tt_ig%3A1646748029197&amp;ei=fWEnYqXNC8qG9u8P0vOu2AE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl_8G61rb2AhVKg_0HHdK5CxsQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6CAguENQCEJECOgsILhCABBDHARCjAjoLCC4QgAQQxwEQ0QM6BQgAEIAEOgoIABCRAhBGEPkBOgUIABCRAjoECAAQQzoHCC4Q1AIQQzoICC4QgAQQ1AI6BQguEJECOgQILhBDOggILhDUAhDLAToFCC4QywE6BQgAEMsBOgcIABAKEMsBOgcILhAKEMsBOgUILhCABDoICAAQFhAKEB46BggAEBYQHkoECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWKc0YKo2aAFwAXgAgAGaA4gB8UCSAQswLjE3LjE4LjMuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">link</a>).

Also, the research “Study on Ways and Methods to Eliminate Sexual Harassment in Egypt” carried out by UN Women in 2013 revealed that over 99.3 % of Egyptian girls and women surveyed reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime. According to the same study 82.6 percent of the total female respondents did not feel safe or secure in the street. The percentage increased to 86.5 percent with regard to safety and security in public transportation.</p>

<p>Muslim Women are abused and harassed by Muslim men during the most spiritual Hajj and 'Umra gatherings</p>
<p>During the most spiritual Hajj and 'Umra gatherings, Muslim women endure abuse and harassment from Muslim men. There are numerous stories shared by Muslim girls recounting their experiences of harassment during Hajj and 'Umra, which occurs due to the combined gatherings of women and men (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=women+harassed+sexually+during+Hajj&amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBveaB_WkezagqihdIsHL5Mwbml4YA:1650247804801&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=vid&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjD68iRxJz3AhVoRPEDHQAGASQQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;biw=1229&amp;bih=585&amp;dpr=1.56" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">link</a>).

<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong class="location">SAN FRANCISCO: </strong>According to the data released by Google, Pakistan tops the list of most porn-searching countries and leads the way in porn searches for animals like pigs, donkeys, dogs, cats and snakes, news website <em><a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/01/15/why_porn_is_exploding_in_the_middle_east_partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salon</a></em> reported on Thursday.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">It further revealed that six of the top eight porn-searching countries were Muslim states. The country at number two in the list was Egypt, while Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey came in at numbers four, five, seven and eight, respectively.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The fact that porn trends within the region can even be tracked was impressive, given that the sale of pornographic material has been banned in nearly every Arab country except Lebanon and Turkey.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More recently, the Saudi Arabian government also announced that it had hacked and disabled about 9,000 Twitter accounts associated with the publication of pornography and arrested many of the handles’ owners. The move was organised by the Commission for the Promotion and Prevention of Vice, also known as Haia, the Saudi religious police.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many Muslim states declare that cemented social morals should not be violated. The data out there, however, suggest their public may feel otherwise.</p>

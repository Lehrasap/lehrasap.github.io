			<description><![CDATA[<p>Muslims are strange people. They have killed billions of animals in the past 1400 years, but they don't even know if it was <strong>Ishaaq</strong> who was slaughtered or <strong>Ismael.</strong></p>
<p>These were 131 narrations that attributed the act of sacrifice to Isaac. However, later Muslims fabricated 133 traditions to refute them and claim that it was not Isaac, but Ishmael, who was sacrificed (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_in_Islam#The_sacrifice">link</a>).</p>
<p>Muslims had a complete motive for fabricating false narrations because a question arose for future Muslims: If Abraham attempted to sacrifice Isaac not in Mecca but in Jerusalem (Al-Aqsa Mosque), then where did the ritual of sacrificing animals at the place of Mina during Hajj originate from? Isaac never came to Mecca, nor did his descendants ever sacrifice animals in that manner.</p>
<p>In fact, during the era of pre-Islamic ignorance, the Arab pagans had a custom of sacrificing animals at the place of Mina for their deities and idols. When Muhammad adopted other rituals and customs of the era of ignorance during Hajj, he also adopted the custom of sacrificing animals.</p>
<p>However, later Muslim hadith scholars tried to eliminate this act of animal sacrifice for the pagan gods by connecting it to the sacrifice of Ismael in Mina (Mecca). But the problem was that there were already 131 narrations existing that testified to Isaac's sacrifice.</p>
<p>Therefore, the deceptive Muslim hadith fabricator created 133 new narrations and associated Ishmael with the act of sacrifice. Along with that, they claimed that Ishmael was attempted to be sacrificed at the place of Mina, and further claimed that the observance of animal sacrifice during Hajj is a continuation of Ishmael's sacrifice.</p>
<p>Imam Qurtabi (under the commentary of Verse 37:102) recorded the name of Sahaba and Tabaeen who declared Ishaaq to be Zabih-Ullah i.e. the son who was sacrificed (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;tSoraNo=37&amp;tAyahNo=102&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic"><span style="color: black;"> وٱختلف العلماء في المأمور بذبحه. فقال أكثرهم: الذبيح إسحاق. وممن قال بذلك العباس بن عبد المطلب وٱبنه عبد اللّه وهو الصحيح عنه. روى الثوريّ وٱبن جريج يرفعانه إلى ٱبن عباس قال: الذبيح إسحاق. وهو الصحيح عن عبد اللّه بن مسعود أن رجلاً قال له: يا بن الأشياخ الكرام. فقال عبد اللّه: ذلك يوسف بن يعقوب بن إسحاق ذبيح اللّه بن إبراهيم خليل اللّه صلى اللّه عليهم وسلم ـ. وقد روى حماد بن زيد يرفعه إلى رسول اللّه صلى الله عليه وسلم قال:</span></span><strong><span class="TextResultArabic"><span style="color: red;"> " إن الكريم ابن الكريم ابن الكريم ابن الكريم يوسف بن يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم صلى الله عليه وسلم " </span></span></strong><span class="TextResultArabic"><span style="color: black;">وروى أبو الزبير عن جابر قال: الذبيح إسحاق. وذلك مروي أيضاً عن عليّ بن أبي طالب رضي اللّه عنه. وعن عبد اللّه بن عمر: أن الذبيح إسحاق. وهو قول عمر رضي اللّه عنه. فهؤلاء سبعة من الصحابة. وقال به من التابعين وغيرهم عَلْقَمة والشّعبي ومجاهد وسعيد بن جُبير وكعب الأحبار وقتادة ومسروق وعِكرمة والقاسم بن أبي بَزَّة وعطاء ومقاتل وعبد الرحمن بن سابط والزهريّ والسديّ وعبد اللّه بن أبي الهذيل ومالك بن أنس، كلهم قالوا: الذبيح إسحاق. وعليه أهل الكتابين اليهود والنصارى، واختاره غير واحد منهم النحاس والطبري وغيرهما. قال سعيد بن جبير: أُرِيَ إبراهيمُ ذبح إسحاق في المنام، فسار به مسيرة شهر في غداة واحدة، حتى أتى به المنحر من مِنىً فلما صرف اللّه عنه الذبح وأمره أن يذبح الكبش فذبحه، وسار به مسيرة شهر في رَوْحة واحدة طويت له الأودية والجبال. وهذا القول أقوى في النقل عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وعن الصحابة والتابعين. وقال آخرون: هو إسماعيل. وممن قال ذلك أبو هريرة وأبو الطفيل عامر بن واثلة. وروي ذلك عن ٱبن عمر وٱبن عباس أيضاً، ومن التابعين سعيد بن المسيّب والشّعبي ويوسف بن مِهْران ومجاهد والربيع بن أنس ومحمد بن كعب القُرَظيّ والكلبي وعلقمة. </span></span></p>
<p>The scholars differed regarding who was commanded to be sacrificed. Most of them said it was Isaac. Among those who said so were Abbas ibn Abdul Muttalib and his son Abdullah, and this is the correct opinion attributed to them. Ath-Thawri and Ibn Jurayj narrated it from Ibn Abbas, who said, "The one to be sacrificed was Isaac." And this is also the correct opinion attributed to Abdullah ibn Mas'ud. A man said to him, "O son of noble men," and Abdullah replied, "That was Yusuf, son of Yaqub, son of Isaac, son of Ibrahim, the beloved friend of Allah, peace be upon them." Hammad ibn Zaid narrated it, attributing it to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, who said, "Verily, the generous one, son of the generous one, son of the generous one, son of the generous one, is Yusuf, son of Yaqub, son of Isaac, son of Ibrahim, peace be upon them." Abu Az-Zubayr narrated from Jabir, who said, "The one to be sacrificed was Isaac." This opinion is also narrated from Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him. Abdullah ibn Umar said, "The one to be sacrificed was Isaac," and this was the opinion of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him. These are the statements of seven companions. It is also reported from some of the successors and others, such as Alqamah, Ash-Sha'bi, Mujahid, Sa'id ibn Jubayr, Ka'b al-Ahbar, Qatadah, Masruq, Ikrimah, Al-Qasim ibn Abi Bazza, Ata, Muqatil, Abdul Rahman ibn Sabit, Az-Zuhri, As-Suddi, Abdullah ibn Abi Hathil, and Malik ibn Anas. All of them said, "The one to be sacrificed was Isaac." This is also the opinion of the People of the two Scriptures, the Jews and the Christians. It was chosen by more than one of them, including An-Nahhas, At-Tabari, and others. Sa'id ibn Jubayr said, "Ibrahim saw in a dream that he was sacrificing Isaac. He traveled with him for a month until he reached the place of sacrifice in Mina. When Allah turned the sacrifice away from him and commanded him to sacrifice the ram, he did so. He traveled with it for a month in a single morning, and the valleys and mountains were flattened for him." <strong>This opinion is stronger in terms of the narration from the Prophet, peace be upon him, and from the companions and the successors</strong>.</p>
<p>Others said it was Ishmael. Among those who said so were Abu Hurairah and Abu At-Tufayl Amer ibn Wathilah. It is also narrated from Ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas. Among the successors who held this opinion were Sa'id ibn Al-Musayyib, Ash-Sha'bi, Yusuf ibn Mihran, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi' ibn Anas, Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Quradhi, Al-Kalbi, and Alqamah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, Imam Qurtabi wrote his own conclusion in the following words (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;tSoraNo=37&amp;tAyahNo=102&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>

<h2>Trusting in Muslim Ahadith is nothing short of madness:</h2>
<p>Another interesting point to note is that both Ibn Abbas and Umar ibn Khattab, among the companions, have narrations attributed to them in which they refer to Isaac as the one to be sacrificed. However, there are also narrations in which they refer to Ishmael as the one to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>The same situation applies among the successors (i.e. Taba'in).  Shabi, Mujahid, and Alqamah, for example, have some narrations in which they refer to Isaac as the one to be sacrificed, while in other narrations, they refer to Ishmael.</p>
<p>These contradictions expose the false hadith factory that was established for the sake of the honor of the Muslim religion. Believing in the hadiths of Muslims after this is nothing short of madness.</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<p>There are two distinct types of traditions.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first type encompasses those traditions in which Muhammad claims to have received direct revelations solely from an "unseen" angel Gabriel. As there are no other witnesses besides Muhammad himself, absolute trust in such traditions is unwarranted, considering that Muhammad could have potentially shaped these revelations to align with his personal desires. To observe Muhammad's actions in this regard, refer to the article titled: <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/divine-revelation-or-a-human-drama/muhammad-s-journey-from-4-wives-to-9-wives-with-the-help-of-revelation">The Role of REVELATION in Muhammad's Journey from 4 Marriages to 9 Marriages</a></li>
<li>The second type of tradition involves incidents where multiple individuals act as direct witnesses. Take, for example, the historical event of Banu Qurayzah, where many others also bore witness to Muhammad's act of killing ALL men, including elderly individuals and 12-year-old boys who had reached puberty. Numerous people have accurately recounted these incidents, providing a more reliable basis for trust. However, even this second type of tradition cannot be entirely relied upon, as subsequent generations of Muslims began fabricating traditions from multiple people who were telling the counter-narrative in the same incident.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ilm-ul-Hadith (the so-called science of Hadith) is also a further extension of factories for the fabrication of false Hadiths:</h2>
<p>The issue at hand is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Numerous witnesses faithfully conveyed traditions that exposed the religion and the prophet.</li>
<li>However, in subsequent generations, Muslims began fabricating multiple traditions with conflicting narratives. Nevertheless, this led to doubts arising due to the contradictory nature of these narratives.</li>
<li>Thus, later Muslim generations also introduced Ilm-ul-Hadith, the so-called science of Hadith, with the intention of undermining and ultimately rejecting those traditions that shed light on the flaws within the religion and Muhammad.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consequently, if someone spoke the truth and exposed the religion, then Muslim scholars found it convenient to discredit him by labeling him as a liar, forgetful, or holding incorrect beliefs. This <strong>CONTRADICTION</strong> is evident, as half of the Islamic scholars would deem a person trustworthy and reliable in narrating Hadiths, while the other half would brand the same person as a liar, forgetful, or espousing erroneous beliefs. As a result, a Hadith could be considered authentic (Sahih) by one group of scholars while being deemed weak by the other.</p>
<p>This <strong>CONTRADICTION</strong> within Ilm-ul-Hadith can be observed in the incident regarding which son was sacrificed. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imam Qurtabi (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;tSoraNo=37&amp;tAyahNo=102&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>), utilizing Ilm-ul-Hadith, declared that the 131 traditions indicating that Ishaaq was the sacrificed son were <strong>STRONGER</strong>.</li>
<li>On the other hand, Imam Ibn Kathir(<a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=37&amp;tAyahNo=100&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">)</span>, also employing the same Ilm-ul-Hadith, declared the same 131 traditions about Ishaaq to be <strong>WEAKER</strong>. And he used the same Ilm-ul-Hadith to declare the contradictory 133 traditions of Ismael being sacrificed, to be stronger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindly keep in mind the Universal Truth: <span style="color: #843fa1;">A lie and a falsehood can be identified by the presence of CONTRADICTIONS</span>. </p>
<p>This Universal Truth holds true for Ilm-ul-Hadith as well. <strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">Ilm-ul-Hadith is a LIE and Falsehood that becomes evident through the <span style="color: #843fa1;">CONTRADICTIONS</span> it contains</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Only Muslims had the full MONOPOLY on Hadith and Ilm-ul-Hadith. And they also had the full MOTIVE to introduce falsehood in it, in order to defend the religion and the prophet. </p>
<h2>The Quran and its false Promises are also exposed in this incident</h2>
<p>The Quran claims that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its verses are "easy to understand" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/54.17">54:17</a>)</li>
<li>Its verses are "clear", "manifest" and "guidance" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2">27:1-2</a>)</li>
<li>It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.2">12:2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, these Quranic Promises are also exposed as lies in this incident. The reality is, the Quran is absolutely not CLEAR and EASY to understand despite being in the Arabic language, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a group of Muslim Scholars who use the Quranic Verses to prove it was <strong>Ishaaq</strong>, who was sacrificed.</li>
<li>While the other group of Muslims Scholars also use the <strong>SAME</strong> Quranic Verses to prove it was <strong>Ismael</strong>, who was sacrificed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please read the details in this article: <a href="https://www.answering-islam.org/Shamoun/sacrifice.htm?fbclid=IwAR3KhQV3uLUMUl3ulLQbNVSOUquRIXn5hsUA6qAR7YE66tF8oC370dixXdw">Abraham and the Child of Sacrifice - Isaac or Ishmael?</a> by <a href="https://www.answering-islam.org/Shamoun/contact.htm">Sam Shamoun</a></p>
<h2>Muhammad aimed to exert influence on both the Jewish/Christian communities and the pagan Arabs by establishing a connection between pagan Hajj rituals and the biblical narrative</h2>
<p>It is indeed remarkable that the Quraysh, as well as the wider Arab, Jewish, and Christian populations, had no prior knowledge of the Arab descent from Ismail or any association between the Kaaba, Hajj, and the acts of sacrifice with Ibrahim or Ismail.</p>
<p>Muhammad was the first to assert his lineage from Ismail and link Ibrahim and Ismail to the Kaaba. Seeking recognition from the Jews and Christians, he sought to prove his descent from Ismail, but his claim was not acknowledged, and he was still regarded as a false prophet by Jews and Christians.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Muhammad sought to emphasize the significance of Hajj and its rituals, as they held economic and influential value within his Arab tribe. Additionally, by incorporating Hajj and its rituals into his newly established religion, he could attract the adherence of the pagan Arabs and sway them towards his new religion.</p>]]></description>

			<title>The Lie of Moon Splitting: Ample Proof that Hadiths Cannot Be Trusted</title>
			<link>https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/the-unreliability-of-hadith-and-ilm-ul-hadith/the-lie-of-moon-splitting-ample-proof-that-hadiths-cannot-be-trusted</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/the-unreliability-of-hadith-and-ilm-ul-hadith/the-lie-of-moon-splitting-ample-proof-that-hadiths-cannot-be-trusted</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Background: </strong></h2>
<p>When Muhammad claimed to receive revelations about the unseen, no one could confirm or deny it since people never saw Gabriel. However, when any historical incident happened during the life of Muhammad, then many people became DIRECT eye-witnesses to that historical event, and they also narrated that incident further. However, the problem for Muslims was that many of those incidents were exposing Muhammad and Islam and proving them to be false. </p>
<p>Subsequent generations of Islamic apologists took two approaches to control the damage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, they fabricated hundreds of thousands of false Ahadith to counter genuine incidents. </li>
<li>Secondly, they created Ilm-ul-Hadith (Science of Hadith), which should serve as a <strong>TOOL </strong>to declare any incident as <strong>WEAK and UNRELIABLE </strong>which exposed Muhammad/Islam.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is impossible to prove these Ahadith as a fabrication as all hadith transmitters were Muslims. However, we are fortunate that <strong>contradictions </strong>in these fabrications sometimes expose them as lies.</p>
<p>The moon-splitting incident serves as a classic example of how some Islamists use the deceptive tool of the science of Hadith, known as Ilm-ul-Hadith, to validate fabricated narratives as "Sahih Hadith" (authentic traditions). In some cases, they even went further by presenting them as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_terminology#:~:text=A%20hadith%20is%20said%20to,leading%20back%20to%20its%20source.">Mutawatir Hadith</a>," a category considered even more reliable than Sahih Hadith.</p>
<h2>The incident of the moon splitting</h2>
<p>Numerous authentic and widely transmitted (Mutawatir) Ahadith assert the occurrence of the moon-splitting incident.</p>
<p>Ibn Kathir writes in the commentary of verse 54:1 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=54&amp;tAyahNo=1&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=2&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>قد كان هذا في زمان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، كما ورد ذلك في الأحاديث المتواترة بالأسانيد الصحيحة </p>
<p>The incident of the splitting of the moon occured during the time of Allah's Messenger, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_terminology#Mutawatir"><strong>Mutawatir </strong></a>traditions which have <strong>Sahih (authentic) </strong>chains of transmission. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The incident is as under:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The people of Mecca</strong> asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to show them a miracle. So he showed them the moon split in two halves between which they saw the Hira' mountain.</p>

<li>... and many more</li>
</ul>
<p>These are undoubtedly fabricated traditions and falsehoods propagated by Muslim transmitters of Ahadith.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Quran itself documents the persistent demand of the Pagans/Jews, who repeatedly asked Muhammad/Allah to provide any sign or miracle as evidence of Muhammad's prophethood. However, Muhammad/Allah failed to produce a single sign or miracle. Instead of demonstrating any miraculous signs, the Quran offered various EXCUSES for Muhammad's inability to do so. These Quranic Excuses included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muhammad's inability to perform miracles while he is only a human.</li>
<li>Allah's decision not to send miracles to Muhammad at this time, as previous nations had rejected the miracles of earlier prophets.</li>
<li>Allah does not show any miracle to the pagans as He has already <strong>DECIDED </strong>that the pagans would not get guidance. </li>
<li>Muhammad's refusal to perform miracles for the Jews due to the sins of their forefathers.</li>
<li>The absence of the predicted miracle of the sky falling on the Meccans is attributed to Muhammad's presence among them and Allah didn't want Muhammad to be hurt due to any divine punishment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dear Reader, please contemplate these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>people of Mecca</strong></span> indeed saw the splitting of the moon, why then they were demanding Muhammad to bring a miracle as proof of his prophethood?</li>
<li>And why didn't Allah/Muhammad not simply refer to the incident of the splitting of the moon as proof of Muhammad's prophethood?"</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the Quran consistently offered numerous explanations without ever using the alleged incident of the moon splitting to address the pagans' challenge to provide a miracle. Not only the Quran, but the entire Hadith literature is also devoid of any instance where Muhammad used this alleged miracle of splitting the moon in response to the pagans' demand for a miracle.</p>
<p>Let us see the details about these Quranic Excuses here to understand it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 1st Quranic Excuse: Muhammad cannot show a Miracle while he is only a human</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident occurred in Mecca. Muhammad used to threaten the Meccans, warning them to believe in his prophethood or face the consequences, claiming that his Allah would make the sky fall upon them in fragments. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>: And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "...  <strong>Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">AS YOU HAVE (previously) CLAIMED</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Actually, the pagan Meccans not only accepted this challenge by Muhammad but also extended it and asked Muhammad to show other miracles too and they would believe in his prophethood. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, Muhammad/Allah failed to deliver on this promise.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, Muhammad was forced to come up with an <strong>EXCUSE</strong> for his failure to fulfil his promise and show any miracle. And he made the following excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring. Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>as you have (previously) claimed</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read." <strong> Say: "Glory to my Lord. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(I cannot do it while)</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">I am only man and a messenger</span></em></span></strong></span>." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer of the Quran (i.e., Muhammad himself) attempted to justify his failure to perform miracles by claiming that he was merely a messenger and could not perform miracles.</p>
<p>However, the pagan Meccans had issued this challenge not only to Muhammad <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but also to Muhammad's god <span style="color: #2800ff;">(i.e., Allah was already automatically included in this challenge)</span></strong></span>. They believed that if Allah truly existed, He should have demonstrated a miracle to them.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was Muhammad/Allah who promised that the sky would fall upon them if they didn't believe in Muhammad's prophethood. Yet, both Muhammad and his Allah failed to fulfil their promise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Muhammad's lack of miracles was due to his role as a mere messenger, why did previous prophets demonstrate miracles to validate their prophethood? For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, Cured the blind and the leper and gave life to the dead by God’s permission (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.110">5:110</a> and <a href="https://quranx.com/3.49">3:49</a>).</li>
<li>Moses received nine miracles, including his staff transforming into a dragon, his hand becoming radiant, the plague of locusts/lice, the swarm of frogs, and the parting of the sea for the Children of Israel (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.101">17:101</a>).</li>
<li>Solomon comprehended the language of animals and birds and controlled jinn and winds (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.16?context=2">27:16-17</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/34.12?context=2">34:12-13</a>),</li>
<li>while Joseph interpreted dreams and predicted future events (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.46?context=2">12:46-47</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/40.51?context=2">40:51-52</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the Meccans were correct in their demand. Even the Quran mentioned their argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/21.5">21:5</a>: So let him bring us a sign just <strong>as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles].</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, if the earlier prophets were able to demonstrate miracles despite being humans, why then Muhammad could not?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And then the Quran claims that Allah does not change his PRACTICE (i.e. Sunnah):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.77">17:77</a>:</strong> This has been Our Way with the Messengers whom We sent before you. You will find <strong>no change</strong> in our <strong>Practice</strong> (i.e. the Sunnah of Allah).</p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>:</strong> [This is] the established practice of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the Practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>:</strong> <strong>But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quran presents a contradiction regarding the expectation of miracles from prophets. In one instance, it suggests that prophets are not required to display miracles as evidence of their prophethood, yet in another, it describes earlier prophets performing miracles to prove their legitimacy. This raises a question: Why did earlier prophets show miracles to disbelievers, but Muhammad and his Allah refused to do so?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that the Quran recounts fictional tales of earlier prophets' miracles, which cannot be verified since they took place in the distant past. Conversely, when it came to Muhammad and his Allah, they were expected to perform miracles in real-time, right before the very eyes of the Kuffar Meccans who challenged them. However, they failed to deliver on these expectations.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>PS: </strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This Excuse in the Quranic Verse also challenges those so-called Sahih Islamic Traditions (Ahadith) which claim that Muhammad showed Meccans the miracle of the splitting of the moon. Had Muhammad really split the moon, then he would have presented it to the Kuffar Meccans as proof of his prophethood. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2>The 2nd Quranic Excuse: Allah would not send a miracle to Muhammad this time while nations of earlier prophets denied the miracles of earlier prophets</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident also happened in Mecca.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58-59</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَسْطُورًا</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِلَّآ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Meccans repeatedly asked Muhammad for a miracle, but he always offered new excuses for not delivering one. Earlier Muhammad claimed he could not perform any miracle while he was only a human being. But that excuse was shaky as the challenge was not limited to Muhammad only, but his god (i.e. Allah) was also automatically included in that challenge. </p>
<p>Thus, Muhammad was forced to change his excuse. This time, he came up with a new excuse that Allah had ceased sending new miracles/signs since earlier people rejected them.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, Allah's practice (i.e. Sunnah of Allah ) supposedly changed when earlier people denied the signs. However, this contradicts the Quranic CLAIM that Allah's Sunnah never changes.</p>
<p>As they say, where there's a contradiction, there's a lie.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's worth noting that there's also a flaw in Verse 58:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad recounted various tales in the Quran about ancient prophets like Thamud, 'Aad and Saleh etc., describing how their communities were destroyed by Allah. Muhammad presumed that nobody could fact-check his accounts by journeying into the past. However, he made a critical error.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that, according to the Quran, Jesus also performed miracles in front of the Jews and Romans. He spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, cured the blind and the leper, and even brought the dead back to life, all by God's permission (Quran 5:110 and 3:49). Yet, neither the Jews nor the Romans believed in him. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Despite this, neither the Jews nor the Romans of Jesus's era were destroyed </strong></span>(<span style="color: #0000ff;">which again goes against the Quranic Promise of Destruction</span>).</p>
<p>The incident of Jesus took place in the recent past, making it feasible to verify its authenticity through historical records. Thus, this claim in the Quran has been exposed as a lie.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The 3rd Excuse: Muhammad shouldn't have asked Allah for a Miracle while Allah had misguided the Pagans</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the previous two excuses naturally failed to satisfy people regarding Muhammad's/Allah's inability to show any miracle. They continued to ask Muhammad to bring a miracle as proof of his prophethood. To deflect their demand, Muhammad introduced another excuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>He (Muhammad) cannot ask Allah for any miracle because Allah does not want the pagans to be guided.</li>
<li>And if he (Muhammad) persists in asking Allah for a miracle, then Allah will punish him, and he (Muhammad) will be among the ignorant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/6/35/default.htm">6:35</a>:</p>
<p>وَإِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكَ إِعْرَاضُهُمْ فَإِنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتَ أَن تَبْتَغِىَ نَفَقًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَوْ سُلَّمًا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَأْتِيَهُم <strong>بِـَٔايَةٍ</strong> ۚ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَمَعَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ ۚ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ</p>
<p>If you (O Muhammad) find rejection by the unbelievers so unbearable, then seek a tunnel into the ground or a ladder into the sky in order to bring them a <strong>SIGN</strong>, but [remember that], <strong>had God willed it</strong>, <strong>He would have guided all of them. Do not be among the ignorant (by asking a SIGN from Allah)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more, this verse serves as evidence that no miracle was shown to the Meccan disbelievers by Muhammad/Allah. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2>The 4th Quranic Excuse: Muhammad will not show the miracle to the Jews while their forefathers sinned</h2>
<p>This incident happened just after Muhammad's migration to Medina when he had to prove his prophethood to the Jews of Medina. </p>
<p>The Bible contains several passages that highlight the phenomenon of divine acceptance of a person's sacrificial offering through the appearance of a mysterious fire that consumes the offering. These instances can be found in verses such as Judges 6:20-21, 13:19-20, and 2 Chronicles 7:1-2.</p>
<p>Actually, Muhammad had already made a mistake, and he had also previously confirmed this method of the miracle of fire in the Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.27">5:27</a>, in the story of Adam and his sons, where a fire appeared and consumed the offering of one son who sacrificed a sheep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/5.27"> 5:27</a>:</p>
<p>Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one, but not from the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tafsir Tabari, under verse 5:27 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=3&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was narrated from as-Suddi, in his narration from Abu Maalik and from Abu Saalih from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Murrah from Ibn Mas‘ood, and from some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ... Habeel (Abel) offered a fat lamb as his offering, while Qabeel (Cain) presented a sheaf of corn but secretly took out and consumed a large portion of the corn. Subsequently, fire descended from the heavens and consumed Habeel's offering, while Qabeel's offering remained untouched and unaccepted. In response, Qabeel became enraged and threatened to kill Habeel, vowing that he would not allow him to marry his sister.</p>
<p><b>Grade</b>:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220428104808/https://dorar.net/h/808e9bbf2bff4252bd3830e50578ec2d"> Sahih (Albani)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, when Muhammad asserted his prophethood, the Jews asked him to provide proof through the manifestation of a miracle, specifically the fire consuming his offering.</p>
<p>Muhammad found himself unable to dismiss this demand outright, as he already acknowledged it in the story of Adam in the Quran.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad resorted to a different approach, offering a new excuse. He accepted the validity of the miracle involving the fire accepting the offering, but he refused to showcase this miracle. He justified his inability to show this miracle by accusing the Jews of Medina that their forefathers sinned by killing previous prophets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/3.183?context=3"> 3:183</a>:</p>
<p>They (the Jews) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in any messenger <b>unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire</b> (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: <b>why then did ye slay them</b>, if ye speak the truth?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this excuse by the writer of the Quran does not hold up under scrutiny for several reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is unjust to punish individuals for the sins of their ancestors. In this case, the writer of the Quran is essentially claiming to hold the Jews of his time accountable for the actions of their forefathers. This contradicts the concept of divine justice, which does not attribute guilt based on lineage.</p>
<p>Didn't the quran claim that no one is accountable for the action of others?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/6.164">6:164</a>:</p>
<p>Say, "Is it other than Allāh I should desire as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? <strong>And every soul earns not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the Jews of Muhammad's era maintained a strong belief in their own holy scriptures, which also indicated that the proof of prophethood involved successfully passing the miracle test. It is understandable that they would request the same evidence from Muhammad and, upon his failure to provide it, reject his claims. This rejection cannot be seen as their fault, as they were simply following the principles outlined in their own religious texts.</p>
<p>Ironically, when the Jewish holy books seemingly predicted the arrival of Muhammad (<a href="https://www.judaism-islam.com/muhammad-in-the-torah-bible/">according to Muslim claims</a>), Muhammad expected the Jews to adhere to their own scriptures. However, when those same holy books instructed them to seek the miracle of fire as a validation of prophethood, Muhammad wanted them to abandon that requirement. This double standard raises questions about consistency and fairness.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the writer of the Quran contradicts his own claims within the text. The Quran repeatedly asserts that the practices of Allah remain unchanging. Yet, in this instance, Muhammad is deviating from that principle by rejecting the miracle of fire as a valid proof of prophethood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>: [This is] the established way of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>: <strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Muhammad was unable to perform the miracle of fire in front of the Jews, a sudden shift occurred in the ways of Allah to accommodate his inability to demonstrate miracles.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it is worth noting that compared to the ancestors of the Jews, the ancestors of the <strong>pagan Meccans (Mushrikeen)</strong> did not have a history of killing prophets. However, Muhammad didn't show any miracle to them too by making other excuses. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad got so much exposure in this incident, that despite all his struggles to make the Jews of Medina happy in the beginning (by adopting many Biblical laws in Islamic Sharia), not even 10 Jews of Medina believed in him and converted to Islam;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3941">Sahih Bukhari, 3941</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Prophet said: <span class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">"Had only ten Jews believe me, all the Jews would definitely have believed me."</strong></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 5th Quranic Excuse: The Miracle of the Sky Falling on the Meccans Did Not Occur due to Muhammad's Presence Among Them</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident happened later in Medina after Muhammad had also failed to show the miracle of fire to the Jews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/8.32?context=2">8:32</a>: </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And when they [Meccans] said, "O Allah, if this should be the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment."<strong> But Allah did not punish them while you, [O Muhammad], was among them</strong>, and Allah would not punish them while they sought forgiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse was revealed in Medina after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Badr">Battle of Badr</a> (in the 2nd Hijri Year), in which Muhammad got victory against the Meccan pagans. </p>
<p>Is it not strange and ridiculous that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AFTER MANY MANY YEARS</strong></span>, Allah remembered to tell the <strong>reason </strong>why He didn't let the sky fall on Meccan pagans? During the 13 years of the Meccan life of Muhammad, the pagans were constantly demanding and challenging Muhammad/Allah to fulfil their promise, but Allah uttered not a single word. </p>
<p>Two more pertinent questions arise from this narrative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, why did Allah not choose to punish the Meccans with the miracle of the falling sky during Muhammad's absence or just after his migration to Medina? Due to no divine punishment, the Meccan pagans succeeded in waging wars against Muhammad, even killing many Muslims and even breaking the teeth of Muhammad in the Battle of Uhud. But despite breaking the teeth of Muhammad, and despite Muhammad's absence among them, still no sky fell on them. </li>
<li>Secondly, the Meccans did not solely request the miracle of punishment; rather, they sought any miraculous manifestation (even without any punishment), similar to those experienced by the previous prophets, that could substantiate Muhammad's claim to prophethood. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Please see the following verse again where they are also asking Muhammad for any miracle (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>even without punishment</strong></span>), and they were ready to believe in his prophethood. </span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(1)</strong></span> you break open for us from the ground a spring. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(2)</strong></span> Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the SKY FALL UPON US IN FRAGMENTS AS YOU HAVE CLAIMED <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(3)</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(4)</strong></span> Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(5)</strong></span> or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read."  Say: "Glory to my Lord. (I cannot do it while) I am only man and a messenger." </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, Muhammad along with his Allah failed to show even any simple miracle without any punishment, as it happened in the cases of previous prophets. </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islamic Excuse: The incident of the splitting of the moon is also present in the Quran</h2>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This does not mean that heaven will split asunder into TWO Equal Parts, but it means total destruction. Similarly:</p>

<h2>Islamic Excuse: 3000 Ahadith about different miracles of the Prophet cannot be wrong</h2>
<p>An Islamic apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dismissing Hadith entirely in order to formulate your thesis is the set up of a strawman because you're not working within the full framework of religious texts that are followed by the religious community. Thus, your argument can only validly work against Hadith Rejectors/Quranists, not against mainstream Islam. Per mainstream Islam, there are more than enough Hadith that demonstrate that Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) did miracles, some of which are indeed touched upon in the Qur'an [e.g., the moon splitting, night journey and ascension].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our Response:</strong></p>
<p>There existed no witness of the alleged miracle of night journey and ascension, and thus Muhammad never presented it as proof in front of the Pagans/Jews. </p>
<p>Only Muslims regard the science of hadith as reliable. Therefore, using it as evidence in this discussion is entirely futile unless you can prove the reliability of the science of hadith.</p>
<p>There are numerous so-called Sahih (authentic) and Ahadith that claim the occurrence of the incident of the splitting of the moon, such as those found in:</p>

<li>... and many more (Muslims claim these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_terminology#:~:text=A%20hadith%20is%20said%20to,leading%20back%20to%20its%20source.">Mutawatir </a>Ahadith regarding this issue)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, all of them are contradicted by the Quranic verses themselves, which assert that Allah had ceased sending signs/miracles to the disbelievers of Muhammad's era, as earlier disbelieving nations failed to heed signs/miracles (Quran 17:58-59).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58-59</a>:</p>
<p>وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَسْطُورًا وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِلَّآ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">And We <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REFRAIN </strong></span>from sending the <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>signs </strong></span>(now in front of Kuffar Meccans), <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only because the men of former generations treated them as false</strong></span></span>. (Translated by Yusuf Ali)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, Muhammad himself never presented this so-called splitting of the moon as a miracle of his prophethood, despite constant demands from the Meccans to demonstrate any miracle.</p>
<p>This serves as sufficient evidence that no such incident of moon splitting by Muhammad ever occurred, and all those numerous so-called Sahih (and Mutawatir) Ahadith regarding that incident are nothing more than fabrications by Muslims.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ahadith can never be relied upon, as Muslim transmitters of hadith were engaging in the fabrication of Ahadith.</p>
<p>If these numerous Sahih (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_terminology#:~:text=A%20hadith%20is%20said%20to,leading%20back%20to%20its%20source.">Mutawatir</a>) Ahadith are proven to be fabrications in the case of the splitting of the moon, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>then what assurance is there that other 3000 Ahadith concerning other miracles are not fabrications as well?</strong></span></p>

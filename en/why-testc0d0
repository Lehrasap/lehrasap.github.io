			<description><![CDATA[<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Summary:</h2>
<p>In the first part of this series, we discussed how Allah set a highly challenging TEST for humans, one that is almost IMPOSSIBLE for billions of people born into non-Muslim families by Allah's Design to pass. Consequently, these 99.9999% of people are doomed to eternal hellfire.</p>
<p>But what about Allah? Did He pass His own TEST?</p>
<p>Muhammad claimed that Allah exists in the heavens. However, neither Allah nor any angel has appeared to us directly. The only way to verify Allah's existence would be through witnessing a miracle from Him as proof. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pagans and Jews of Muhammad's time frequently demanded that Muhammad show them even the smallest miracle as proof of Allah, promising to convert to Islam if they saw such evidence.</li>
<li>This demand was consistent with stories of earlier practices, where prophets demonstrated miracles as proof of their prophethood and divine mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Muhammad and his Allah failed to pass this TEST. They were unable to show even the tiniest miracle to the pagans and Jews.</p>
<p>Muhammad and his Allah offered several EXCUSES in the Quran for their inability to produce even the slightest miracle.</p>
<p>Let us examine these excuses and determine if they hold any weight.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 1st Quranic Excuse: Muhammad cannot show a Miracle while he is only a human</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident occurred in Mecca. Muhammad used to threaten the Meccans, warning them to believe in his prophethood or face the consequences, claiming that his Allah would make the sky fall upon them in fragments. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>: And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "...  <strong>Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">AS YOU HAVE (previously) CLAIMED</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Actually, the pagan Meccans not only accepted this challenge by Muhammad but also extended it and asked Muhammad to show other miracles too and they would believe in his prophethood. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, Muhammad/Allah failed to deliver on this promise.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, Muhammad was forced to come up with an <strong>EXCUSE</strong> for his failure to fulfil his promise and show any miracle. And he made the following excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring. Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>as you have (previously) claimed</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read." <strong> Say: "Glory to my Lord. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(I cannot do it while)</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">I am only man and a messenger</span></em></span></strong></span>." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer of the Quran (i.e., Muhammad himself) attempted to justify his failure to perform miracles by claiming that he was merely a messenger and could not perform miracles.</p>
<p>However, the pagan Meccans had issued this challenge not only to Muhammad <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but also to Muhammad's god <span style="color: #2800ff;">(i.e., Allah was already automatically included in this challenge)</span></strong></span>. They believed that if Allah truly existed, He should have demonstrated a miracle to them.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was Muhammad/Allah who promised that the sky would fall upon them if they didn't believe in Muhammad's prophethood. Yet, both Muhammad and his Allah failed to fulfill their promise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Muhammad's lack of miracles was due to his role as a mere messenger, why did previous prophets demonstrate miracles to validate their prophethood? For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, Cured the blind and the leper and gave life to the dead by God’s permission (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.110">5:110</a> and <a href="https://quranx.com/3.49">3:49</a>).</li>
<li>Moses received nine miracles, including his staff transforming into a dragon, his hand becoming radiant, the plague of locusts/lice, the swarm of frogs, and the parting of the sea for the Children of Israel (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.101">17:101</a>).</li>
<li>Solomon comprehended the language of animals and birds and controlled jinn and winds (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.16?context=2">27:16-17</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/34.12?context=2">34:12-13</a>),</li>
<li>while Joseph interpreted dreams and predicted future events (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.46?context=2">12:46-47</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/40.51?context=2">40:51-52</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the Meccans were correct in their demand. Even the Quran mentioned their argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/21.5">21:5</a>: So let him bring us a sign just <strong>as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles].</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, if the earlier prophets were able to demonstrate miracles despite being humans, why then Muhammad could not?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And then the Quran claims that Allah does not change his PRACTICE (i.e. Sunnah):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.77">17:77</a>:</strong> This has been Our Way with the Messengers whom We sent before you. You will find <strong>no change</strong> in our <strong>Practice</strong> (i.e. the Sunnah of Allah).</p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>:</strong> [This is] the established practice of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the Practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>:</strong> <strong>But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quran presents a contradiction regarding the expectation of miracles from prophets. In one instance, it suggests that prophets are not required to display miracles as evidence of their prophethood, yet in another, it describes earlier prophets performing miracles to prove their legitimacy. This raises a question: Why did earlier prophets show miracles to disbelievers, but Muhammad and his Allah refused to do so?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that the Quran recounts fictional tales of earlier prophets' miracles, which cannot be verified since they took place in the distant past. Conversely, when it came to Muhammad and his Allah, they were expected to perform miracles in real-time, right before the very eyes of the Kuffar Meccans who challenged them. However, they failed to deliver on these expectations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The 2nd Quranic Excuse: Allah would not send a miracle to Muhammad this time while nations of earlier prophets denied the miracles of earlier prophets</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident also happened in Mecca.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58-59</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَسْطُورًا</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِلَّآ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ</span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And We <span style="color: #e03e2d; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REFRAIN </strong></span>from sending the signs (now in front of Kuffar Meccans), <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only because the men of former generations treated them as false</strong></span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meccans repeatedly asked Muhammad for a miracle, but he always offered new excuses for not delivering one. Earlier Muhammad claimed he could not perform any miracle while he was only a human being. But that excuse was shaky as the challenge was not limited to Muhammad only, but his god (i.e. Allah) was also automatically included in that challenge. </p>
<p>Thus, Muhammad was forced to change his excuse. This time, he came up with a new excuse that Allah had ceased sending new miracles/signs since earlier people rejected them.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, Allah's practice (i.e. Sunnah of Allah ) supposedly changed when earlier people denied the signs. However, this contradicts the Quranic CLAIM that Allah's Sunnah never changes.</p>
<p>As they say, where there's a contradiction, there's a lie.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's worth noting that there's also a flaw in Verse 58:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad recounted various tales in the Quran about ancient prophets like Thamud, 'Aad and Saleh etc., describing how their communities were destroyed by Allah. Muhammad presumed that nobody could fact-check his accounts by journeying into the past. However, he made a critical error.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that, according to the Quran, Jesus also performed miracles in front of the Jews and Romans. He spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, cured the blind and the leper, and even brought the dead back to life, all by God's permission (Quran 5:110 and 3:49). Yet, neither the Jews nor the Romans believed in him. <span style="background-color: rgb(251, 238, 184);"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Despite this, neither the Jews nor the Romans of Jesus's era were destroyed </strong></span>(which again goes against the Quranic Promise of Destruction). <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><strong>The incident of Jesus took place in the recent past, making it feasible to verify its authenticity through historical records. Thus, this claim in the Quran has been exposed as a lie.</strong></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The 3rd Excuse: Muhammad shouldn't ask Allah for a Miracle while Allah had misguided the Pagans</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the previous two excuses naturally failed to satisfy people regarding Muhammad's/Allah's inability to show any miracle. They continued to ask Muhammad to bring a miracle as proof of his prophethood. To deflect their demand, Muhammad introduced another excuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>He (Muhammad) cannot ask Allah for any miracle because Allah does not want the pagans to be guided.</li>
<li>And if he (Muhammad) persists in asking Allah for a miracle, then Allah will punish him, and he (Muhammad) will be among the ignorant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/6/35/default.htm">6:35</a>:</p>
<p>وَإِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكَ إِعْرَاضُهُمْ فَإِنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتَ أَن تَبْتَغِىَ نَفَقًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَوْ سُلَّمًا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَأْتِيَهُم <strong>بِـَٔايَةٍ</strong> ۚ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَمَعَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ ۚ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ</p>
<p>If you (O Muhammad) find rejection by the unbelievers so unbearable, then seek a tunnel into the ground or a ladder into the sky in order to bring them a <strong>SIGN</strong>, but [remember that], <strong>had God willed it</strong>, <strong>He would have guided all of them. Do not be among the ignorant (by asking a SIGN from Allah)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more, this verse serves as evidence that no miracle was shown to the Meccan disbelievers by Muhammad/Allah. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2>The 4th Quranic Excuse: Muhammad will not show the miracle to the Jews while their forefathers sinned</h2>
<p>This incident happened just after Muhammad's migration to Medina when he had to prove his prophethood to the Jews of Medina. </p>
<p>The Bible contains several passages that highlight the phenomenon of divine acceptance of a person's sacrificial offering through the appearance of a mysterious fire that consumes the offering. These instances can be found in verses such as Judges 6:20-21, 13:19-20, and 2 Chronicles 7:1-2.</p>
<p>Actually, Muhammad had already made a mistake, and he had also previously confirmed this method of the miracle of fire in the Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.27">5:27</a>, in the story of Adam and his sons, where a fire appeared and consumed the offering of one son who sacrificed a sheep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/5.27"> 5:27</a>:</p>
<p>Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one, but not from the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tafsir Tabari, under verse 5:27 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=3&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was narrated from as-Suddi, in his narration from Abu Maalik and from Abu Saalih from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Murrah from Ibn Mas‘ood, and from some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ... Habeel (Abel) offered a fat lamb as his offering, while Qabeel (Cain) presented a sheaf of corn but secretly took out and consumed a large portion of the corn. Subsequently, fire descended from the heavens and consumed Habeel's offering, while Qabeel's offering remained untouched and unaccepted. In response, Qabeel became enraged and threatened to kill Habeel, vowing that he would not allow him to marry his sister.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220428104808/https://dorar.net/h/808e9bbf2bff4252bd3830e50578ec2d"> Sahih (Albani)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, when Muhammad asserted his prophethood, the Jews asked him to provide proof through the manifestation of a miracle, specifically the fire consuming his offering.</p>
<p>Muhammad found himself unable to dismiss this demand outright, as he already acknowledged it in the story of Adam in the Quran.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad resorted to a different approach, offering a new excuse. He accepted the validity of the miracle involving the fire accepting the offering, but he refused to showcase this miracle. He justified his inability to show this miracle by accusing the Jews of Medina that their forefathers sinned by killing previous prophets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/3.183?context=3"> 3:183</a>:</p>
<p>They (the Jews) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in any messenger <strong>unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire</strong> (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: <strong>why then did ye slay them</strong>, if ye speak the truth?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this excuse by the writer of the Quran does not hold up under scrutiny for several reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is unjust to punish individuals for the sins of their ancestors. In this case, the writer of the Quran is essentially claiming to hold the Jews of his time accountable for the actions of their forefathers. This contradicts the concept of divine justice, which does not attribute guilt based on lineage.</p>
<p>Didn't the quran claim that no one is accountable for the action of others?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/6.164">6:164</a>:</p>
<p>Say, "Is it other than Allāh I should desire as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? <strong>And every soul earns not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the Jews of Muhammad's era maintained a strong belief in their own holy scriptures, which also indicated that the proof of prophethood involved successfully passing the miracle test. It is understandable that they would request the same evidence from Muhammad and, upon his failure to provide it, reject his claims. This rejection cannot be seen as their fault, as they were simply following the principles outlined in their own religious texts.</p>
<p>Ironically, when the Jewish holy books seemingly predicted the arrival of Muhammad (<a href="https://www.judaism-islam.com/muhammad-in-the-torah-bible/">according to Muslim claims</a>), Muhammad expected the Jews to adhere to their own scriptures. However, when those same holy books instructed them to seek the miracle of fire as a validation of prophethood, Muhammad wanted them to abandon that requirement. This double standard raises questions about consistency and fairness.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the writer of the Quran contradicts his own claims within the text. The Quran repeatedly asserts that the practices of Allah remain unchanging. Yet, in this instance, Muhammad is deviating from that principle by rejecting the miracle of fire as a valid proof of prophethood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>: [This is] the established way of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>: <strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Muhammad was unable to perform the miracle of fire in front of the Jews, a sudden shift occurred in the ways of Allah to accommodate his inability to demonstrate miracles.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it is worth noting that compared to the ancestors of the Jews, the ancestors of the <strong>pagan Meccans (Mushrikeen)</strong> did not have a history of killing prophets. However, Muhammad didn't show any miracle to them too by making other excuses. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad got so much exposure in this incident, that despite all his struggles to make the Jews of Medina happy in the beginning (by adopting many Biblical laws in Islamic Sharia), not even 10 Jews of Medina believed in him and converted to Islam;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3941">Sahih Bukhari, 3941</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Prophet said: <span class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">"Had only ten Jews believe me, all the Jews would definitely have believed me."</strong></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 5th Quranic Excuse: The Miracle of the Sky Falling on the Meccans Did Not Occur due to Muhammad's Presence Among Them</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident happened later in Medina after Muhammad had also failed to show the miracle of fire to the Jews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/8.32?context=2">8:32</a>: </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And when they [Meccans] said, "O Allah, if this should be the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment."<strong> But Allah did not punish them while you, [O Muhammad], was among them</strong>, and Allah would not punish them while they sought forgiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse was revealed in Medina after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Badr">Battle of Badr</a> (in the 2nd Hijri Year), in which Muhammad got victory against the Meccan pagans. </p>
<p>Is it not strange and ridiculous that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AFTER MANY MANY YEARS</strong></span>, Allah remembered to tell the <strong>reason </strong>why He didn't let the sky fall on Meccan pagans? During the 13 years of the Meccan life of Muhammad, the pagans were constantly demanding and challenging Muhammad/Allah to fulfil their promise, but Allah uttered not a single word. </p>
<p>Two more pertinent questions arise from this narrative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, why did Allah not choose to punish the Meccans with the miracle of the falling sky during Muhammad's absence or just after his migration to Medina? Due to no divine punishment, the Meccan pagans succeeded in waging wars against Muhammad, even killing many Muslims and even breaking the teeth of Muhammad in the Battle of Uhud. But despite breaking the teeth of Muhammad, and despite Muhammad's absence among them, still no sky fell on them. </li>
<li>Secondly, the Meccans did not solely request the miracle of punishment; rather, they sought any miraculous manifestation (even without any punishment), similar to those experienced by the previous prophets, that could substantiate Muhammad's claim to prophethood. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Please see the following verse again where they are also asking Muhammad for any miracle (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>even without punishment</strong></span>), and they were ready to believe in his prophethood. </span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(1)</strong></span> you break open for us from the ground a spring. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(2)</strong></span> Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the SKY FALL UPON US IN FRAGMENTS AS YOU HAVE CLAIMED <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(3)</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(4)</strong></span> Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(5)</strong></span> or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read."  Say: "Glory to my Lord. (I cannot do it while) I am only man and a messenger." </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, Muhammad along with his Allah failed to show even any simple miracle without any punishment, as it happened in the cases of previous prophets. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2>Double Standards: Muhammad <em>always denied</em> showing any miracle of his prophethood, but<em> demanded</em> others to show miracles of their prophethood</h2>
<p>You have seen above how Muhammad always denied showing any miracle of his prophethood. But now let us see the following tradition:  </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3055">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3055</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Ibn 'Umar: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Umar and a group of the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) set out with the Prophet to Ibn Saiyad. He found him playing with some boys near the hillocks of Bani Maghala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty. He did not notice (the Prophet's presence) till the Prophet (ﷺ) stroked him on the back with his hand and said, "Ibn Saiyad! Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, "<em>I testify that you are the Apostle of the illiterates</em>." </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet. "<em>Do you testify that I am the apostle of Allah</em>?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, "I believe in Allah and His Apostles." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to Ibn Saiyad). "What do you see?" Ibn Saiyad replied, "True people and false ones visit me." The Prophet said, "Your mind is confused as to this matter."<em><strong> The Prophet (ﷺ) added, " I have kept something (in my mind) for you." Ibn Saiyad said, "It is Ad-Dukh." The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Shame be on you! You cannot cross your limits.</strong></em>" On that 'Umar said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allow me to chop his head off." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "If he should be him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) then you cannot overpower him, and should he not be him, then you are not going to benefit by murdering him."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad never showed a miracle to others as proof of his prophethood and made several excuses. </li>
<li>But when Ibn Siyad failed to show a miracle on the SPOT, Muhammad IMMEDIATELY blamed him for being a false prophet.  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In simple words, these are Double Standards. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Islamic preacher: Prophet Muhammad showed many other miracles</h2>
<p>And Islamic preacher wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is false to say the Prophet of Allah (PBUH) didn't perform any miracle. He performed many miracles which are found in Ahadith.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">All these are FABRICATED Ahadith, and the Quran is itself a witness to this that Allah had already stopped sending any more miracles/signs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran 17:58-59:</p>

<p>Another Islamic apologist wrote:</p>

<p>The moon splitting article is indeed mentioned in the Quran, which Allah showed to pagans, </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>No, this is only a false claim by Islamic apologists. No such Quranic verse is present which confirms any moon splitting miracle in front of pagans. These are only fabricated Ahadith by Muslims which claim the existence of such moon splitting miracle. Please read our article:</p>

			<title>Allah's Test is the Greatest Injustice Against Mankind</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<h1>Why Test?</h1>
<p>The core question of "Why Test?" bears similarities to the broader inquiry of "Why Creation?" This topic has proven challenging for Islamic scholars and apologists to explain, as it calls into question the<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> underlying motivation behind Allah's choice to TEST His creation</strong></span>.</p>
<p>When this question is posed, Islamic apologists often respond with a familiar refrain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mankind was created to pass the TEST."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this response doesn't address the core question: <span style="color: #1000ff;"><strong>Why did Allah decide to TEST mankind</strong></span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a decision that necessitated their CREATION in the first place</strong></span>?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the notion of a "test" primarily relates to tasks that humanity must undertake <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AFTER</strong></span> they have already been created. Consequently, <strong><span style="color: #1200ff;">the concept of a test doesn't inherently provide a reason or justification for the initial act of CREATION itself</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Islamists have to openly accept that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allah neither told the underlying reason/motivation for the TEST</li>
<li>Nor did Allah tell the reason for not telling it.</li>
</ul>
<div class="group/conversation-turn relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn">

<div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-1 juice:empty:hidden juice:first:pt-[3px]">
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">
<p>Islamists then fabricate new excuses on their own, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>They start insisting that Allah does not need to explain the underlying motivation for why He wants to test us.</li>
<li>Or they claim that even if Allah did explain it to us, we would not be able to comprehend it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why a Test of PRAISING Allah? </h2>
<p>One could have understood i<span>f </span><span>a Test consisted of helping Humanity and doing good deeds and avoiding evils.</span></p>
<p>But why a Test of worshipping and praising Allah 5 times a day?</p>
<p>And this "Worship and Praise Syndrome" extends beyond humans:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider angels—they've been engaged in worshipping and praising Allah for nearly eternity, despite gaining no benefit from it, nor are they destined for paradise. Why does Allah demand their constant worship and praise? Yes, Islamists come up with the same lame excuse that Allah does not need worship and praise from angels, but it is the same as if Allah says: "I am eating food, although I don't need food", or if Allah says: "I am sleeping, although I don't need sleep."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But it doesn't stop with angels. According to Islam, all creatures, from animals and insects to celestial bodies like the moon, sun, and stars, as well as mountains and each and every particle in the universe is worshipping and praising Allah incessantly. <span>Yet, this devotion will not benefit them, as none of these entities will enter paradise and have 72 houris.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn't Allah's insistence on being worshipped and praised 24 hours suggest<span> </span><strong>narcissism</strong>, indicating a self-centered motive for creating humankind and the universe to praise him?</p>
<p>Man has created Allah, which is why all human weaknesses are also found in Allah.</p>
<p>What does Allah gain from the constant praises of angels, animals, birds, and even every particle in the universe? Islamic apologists might say that Allah does not need all this praise ... But then it's again like Allah constantly eating food and also at the same time saying that does not need to eat. </p>

<h2>Allah's Test: The <span style="color: #0300ff;">Greatest</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">INJUSTICE </span>against<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <span style="color: #2100ff;">Mankind</span></span></h2>
<p>There exists no Allah. But if true, then Allah's Test is the greatest injustice against mankind. </p>
<p>We are born as humans only, and it is our parents who indoctrinate us into different religions. This is why 99.9999% of children raised in Christian families adopt Christianity.</p>
<p>Even in this modern era of communication, the conversion rate to Islam is not even 0.0001%. This implies that 99.9999% of people born into non-Muslim families by Allah's design are destined for eternal hellfire, regardless of their good deeds and humanity throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Is this truly Divine Justice?</p>
<p>Our sense of humanity clearly tells us that this is the Greatest <strong>DHULM (injustice)</strong> ever against mankind. There is no greater injustice in the universe than billions of innocent people being condemned to eternal hellfire simply because they were born into non-Muslim families by Allah's design.</p>
<p>Alone this injustice is <strong>ENOUGH</strong> to leave the religion, as it goes against humanity.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Islamic god (i.e. Allah), has never appeared directly before us nor has He shown any miracles as proof of His existence. We are still demanded to feel Him indirectly. However, when we analyse these indirect issues to determine if Allah exists, we perceive the greatest injustice in this expectation. How can we ever accept such an unjust entity as God?</span></p>
<h3>Islamist's Excuse: The TEST is justified while Everyone has HEARD about Islam and thus have a Chance to Accept it</h3>
<p>An Islamist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah is not unjust. Even though 6 billion people are born into non-Muslim families, Islam is prevalent worldwide. They have <strong>heard</strong> about it and have every opportunity to accept Islam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p>We absolutely don't agree with it.</p>
<p>If 99.9999% of people are unable to accept Islam after taking birth in non-Muslim families, <strong>then there is a REASON for it</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to accept Islam, it is not enough to just <strong>HEAR</strong> about its existence, but one has to do a <strong>Long Research</strong> to become <strong>convinced</strong> it to be the only true religion.</p>
<p>How strange, Islamic preachers tell ex-Muslims that they need to be an EXPERT in Islam before leaving it. But they don't put the same condition of being an expert and having a PhD degree before entering Islam. Are these not DOUBLE STANDARDS?</p>
<p>For example, Muhammad claimed that her mother was in hellfire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:976b">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 976b</a>:</p>
<p>The Apostle of Allah visited the grave of his mother and he wept, and moved others around him to tears, and said: I sought permission from my Lord to beg forgiveness for her but it was not granted to me (while she failed in accepting the religion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif">Hanif</a>, and died as non-Mulsim).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the question remains: what chance did a woman have in that era of ignorance to accept the religion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif">Hanif</a>?</p>
<p>In Islam, the followers of the religion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif">Hanif</a> were those who, during the pre-Islamic period of Jahiliyyah, renounced idolatry, Christianity, and Judaism. They followed monotheism and the religion of Abraham, which emphasized submission to God in its purest form.</p>

<div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-1 juice:empty:hidden juice:first:pt-[3px]">
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">
<p>There were barely four followers of the religion of Hanif in Mecca. Two of them later abandoned Hanifism and became apostates. She likely never encountered any of them directly.</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible for someone to convert to another religion merely by hearing about it. Several factors contribute to this difficulty, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indoctrination from childhood into the family's religion, making rebellion almost unthinkable.</li>
<li>Immense pressure from family, tribe, and society against leaving the religion of one's ancestors, particularly challenging for women.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such circumstances, where a woman is under the pressure of her family and tribe, living in the era of ignorance, perhaps herself ignorant, where instead of contemplating religions like a philosopher, the struggle for physical survival is ongoing, how can a woman in such a situation accept the true religion?</p>
<p>Did Muhammad's mother truly have an equal chance of becoming a Muslim compared to those born into Muslim families by Allah's design?</p>
<p>If you acknowledge that she didn't have equal chances, it implies an admission that Allah indeed committed an injustice against the 99.9999% of non-Muslims who were not born into Muslim families by His design.</p>

<p>Another Islamist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah says in the Quran: "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and night there are signs for people of reason" (Quran 3:190). Thus, Allah is not unjust (ZALIM), and all people who are born into non-Muslim families have a full opportunity to accept Islam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that the claim of divine creation is not unique to Islam; virtually all religions assert that their god or gods are responsible for creating the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>For an average person, determining which religious claim about creation is true, is almost impossible. Each religion's scriptures make similar assertions about their deities being the true creators, leaving a layperson with no clear way to discern which is correct. One has to do a lot of research work on all religions to determine which religious god actually created the universe. </p>
<p>Moreover, the argument about the creation of the heavens and the earth pertains solely to the question of whether a god exists or not. It does not cover the answer which specific god of which specific religion created the universe. This argument does not provide definitive proof of the existence of any particular "religious god", including Allah. Furthermore, modern science offers alternative theories about the creation of the universe that challenge these religious claims.</p>
<p>Empirical data does not lie. It proves the notion that this creation of the universe argument fails to convince the vast majority of people born into non-Muslim families. Despite the universal presence of this argument in religious texts, 99.9999% of individuals born into non-Muslim families do not convert to Islam based on this reasoning. According to Islamic belief, this means they are destined for eternal hellfire, which raises questions about the fairness of such a system.</p>

<h2>What will happen to the children born into non-Muslim families who die at a young age without accepting Islam?</h2>
<p>Is there any Muslim with the courage to answer this question: What will happen to the children born into non-Muslim families who die at a young age without accepting Islam? According to Islam, a girl becomes an adult at the age of 9 and a boy at the age of 12. If they die at a young age without accepting Islam, then your Allah will make them the fuel of eternal hellfire. </p>
<p>Is this a Divine Justice in any sense? </p>

<div>
<div>
<h2>The Background Story: Why did Muhammad start claiming that all non-Muslims are fuel of hellfire?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In reality, the underlying motivation for this doctrine was political. Muhammad's companions hesitated to engage in wars with their own Meccan relatives, causing frustration for Muhammad. Thus, Muhammad began proclaiming that disbelief in his prophethood would result in eternal damnation, regardless of one's good deeds, as a means to coerce compliance.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In the early days in Medina, Muhammad attempted to gain favor with the Jews by asserting that all Jews and Christians who do good deeds would go to paradise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/2.62?context=5">2:62:</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Rest assured that whosoever from among the Muslims or the Jews or the Christians or the Sabaeans believes in Allah and the Last Day, and performs good deeds,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> he will have his reward with his Lord and he will have no cause for fear and grief</strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>]</strong></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, as conflicts with the Meccans arose (who were relatives of the migrant Muslims and they showed hesitance to fight against their own relatives), Muhammad changed the message of verse <a href="https://quranx.com/2.62?context=5">2:62</a>. To motivate his followers to fight against their own relatives, he now claimed that despite their good deeds, those relatives would end up in eternal hellfire for not accepting his prophethood. This shift was intended to diminish any love they felt for their relatives and fill them with the necessary animosity to fight against them.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Then Muhammad started telling his companions that his mother, father, uncle Abu Talib and his grandfather Abdul Muttalib are also in hellfire (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/447616/%E2%80%98abdul-muttalib-and-abu-talib-are-in-hellfire">source</a>), so that his companions started feeling hatred against their own non-Muslim relatives, and didn't feel hesitation to fight against them. </p>
<h2>Muhammad's Claim: The TEST is justified while all humans testified Allah is their lord BEFORE their Birth</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Many people were not happy with Muhammad, when he claimed that their parents were fuel of eternal hellfire, while they died without recognising Allah as their lord. But people were unable to understand how their parents could have recognised Allah (or the religion of HANIF) when there were hardly any opportunities available hear the message of Hanif. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anyhow, Muhammad made the following CLAIM to justify the TEST.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/7.172?context=10">7:172</a>:</p>
<p>And when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], "Am I not your Lord?" They said, "Yes, we have testified." [This] - <strong>lest you should say on the <span style="color: #2100ff;">day of Resurrection</span>, "<span style="color: #ff0034;">Indeed, we were of this unaware</span>."</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, it is not an argument, but only a claim by Muhammad. No one is able to verify it if any Allah exists, and who took them out from their loins (before their birth) and let them testify that Allah is their lord. </p>
<p>Secondly, this verse claims that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allah took the promise (to accept him as Lord and to worship him alone) from all humans <strong><span style="color: #ff0034;">BEFOFRE</span> their birth</strong>. </li>
<li>Then they were made to <span style="color: #2100ff;"><strong>FORGET</strong></span> this promise when they were sent <strong>into this world</strong>. </li>
<li>And then they will be reminded of this promise again, <strong>only <span style="color: #ff0034;">AFTER</span> their death (on the day of Ressurection)</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the question is, whatever happened before the birth, or whatever will happen after the death, <strong>why Allah is taking a TEST on its basis in this world</strong>?</p>
<p>It would only become a test if Allah had appeared in this life to all humans, and then He would have put humans to a test, whereby <strong>intentional disobedience</strong> would result in eternal fire.</p>
<p>For example, according to the Islamic story, Allah appeared to Iblees (i.e., Lucifer/Satan), and Iblees was not caused to <span style="color: #2100ff;"><strong>FORGET</strong></span> Allah, but still he intentionally disobeyed Him. In such a case, one can understand why Iblees will be put in hell.</p>
<p>But the case of humans is totally different from that of Iblees, and it has absolutely no justification:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are thousands of people who are born into non-Muslim families. Allah never appeared to them openly as He did to Iblees. Thus, under the influence of their families, 99.9999% of these people never accepted Allah and remained non-Muslims.</li>
<li>Millions of non-Muslims truthfully try to find out the real God, but Islam has so many problematic, controversial, and anti-humanity teachings that they had to reject Islam due to their <strong>true intentions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to mention, there are millions of ex-Muslims who were firmly believing and practicing Muslims. But they also felt the pain of humanity. When they tried to find God with sincere hearts, their search led them to the conclusion that there is no Allah in the heavens, and Muhammad was making revelations on his own. Thus, they left Islam and Allah.</p>
<p>Islam claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>إنما الأعمال <strong>بالنيات</strong></p>
<p>(Verily, the reward of deeds depends on the <strong>intentions</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here we see a clear contradiction. Instead of being judged based on their true intentions, they are called an apostate. Islam demands that they be killed in this life, and then Allah condemns them to eternal hellfire, disregarding all the good deeds they did for mankind. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Islamist's objection:</span></strong></p>
<p>An Islamic preacher wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone says that they do not know or do not remember acknowledging Allah as their Lord as mentioned in Surah Al-A'raf, Ayah 172, this argument is not acceptable. Allah has taken all of us out of our mothers' wombs, and we do not remember what we did or saw in the womb. An atheist does not have an answer for this either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Response</span>: </p>
<p>We do not remember being in the mother's womb today, but our mother remembers, and others have seen us in the womb. There are countless witnesses.</p>
<p>However, in the story where Allah took a covenant from all humans after extracting them from Adam's loins, is there even a single witness to this? Allah is unseen, the angels are unseen, and the revelation is unseen. Consequently, anyone could make such claims about their religious stories where all witnesses are 'unseen'.</p>
<h2>Muhammad's Claim: The Test is justified while mankind itself chose it for themselves</h2>
<p>Muhammad also tried to justify the TEST by bringing the following claim:</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.72">33:72</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>إِنَّا عَرَضْنَا ٱلْأَمَانَةَ عَلَى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلْجِبَالِ فَأَبَيْنَ أَن يَحْمِلْنَهَا وَأَشْفَقْنَ مِنْهَا وَحَمَلَهَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ ۖ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ <strong>ظَلُومًا جَهُولًا</strong></p>
<p>We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to carry it and were afraid of doing so; but man carried it. Surely he is a <strong>tyrant</strong> and <strong>ignorant</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Muhammad's attempt to justify why humans were subjected to the test, a significant issue arises. This argument actually places the blame on Allah Himself rather than on humans. The questions that emerge include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did humans agree to bear this trust?</li>
<li>According to this verse, it is Allah who created humans as <strong>tyrants</strong> and <strong>ignorant</strong> beings, and it was the sole reason that they accepted the test.</li>
<li>Therefore, if it was Allah who created humans as tyrants and ignorant beings, then the true <strong>culprit</strong> is Allah Himself. Humans cannot be held responsible for this, and they should not be unjustly punished.</li>
<li>Moreover, although Allah (i.e. Muhammad) claimed in this verse that the <strong>heavens/earth/mountains</strong> were also presented with the test, but this statement makes no sense as <strong>heavens/earth/mountains have absolutely no FREE Will and they can neither succeed nor fail nor refuse nor become afraid of doing it as they would never fall in the hell or paradise. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This highlights the <strong>complete failure</strong> of Muhammad to present a <strong>single logical argument</strong> for putting humans to the test, especially considering that the majority of them will end up in hell by Allah's Design and suffer eternal torment. How does making humans <strong>ظَلُومًا جَهُولًا tyrant and ignorant</strong> save Allah from injustice of putting majority of humankind in eternal hellfire according to his Design?</p>
<p>And the jinns are not even the “Best of Creations اشرفُ المخلوقات”, and their majority too will still land in the hellfire for eternity. </p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/7.179">7.179</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنسِ</p>
<p>And indeed We have created majority of jinns and men for hell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor jinns. But the good thing is that they don't exist except in the minds of religiously brainwashed people. </p>]]></description>

			<title>Allah's FAILURE to even UNDERSTAND the 3 Questions by the Jews</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<h1>Summary:</h1>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not knowing the answers is one thing.</li>
<li>Providing incorrect answers is even worse.</li>
<li>However, not even comprehending the questions is the worst possible outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Muhammad and his Allah made this critical error by failing to understand the original questions.</p>
<p>The Jews asked Muhammad the following 3 Questions from<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16484"> The Book of Denial</a> (The Bible).</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100.041%; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);" border="1"><colgroup><col style="width: 6.72495%;"><col style="width: 35.6449%;"><col style="width: 57.6302%;"></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Question 1</td>
<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Jews asked Muhammad about the "<strong>Spirit of God <span class="mw-page-title-main"><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3">الروح القدس</a></span></strong>" in the context of the Book of Daniel (i.e. if Daniel <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84"><span dir="rtl">دانيال</span></a> was a prophet or not despite the fact that the Spirit of God showed him "Visions"). A significant dispute arose when the Christians regarded Daniel as a prophet, as the Spirit of God had shown him visions, whereas the Jews did not. Consequently, the Jews believed that if Muhammad was truly a prophet of God, he would be able to resolve this disagreement.</td>

<h2>Details:</h2>
<p>In the 2nd part of this series of "The Test", we saw how Muhammad (and his Allah) FAILED constantly to show even a single tinniest miracle in front of the pagan Meccans, despite repetitive demand from them. Please read this 2nd part here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/why-test/allah-failed-to-pass-his-own-test-of-showing-a-miracle">Allah's FAILURE to pass his own <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>TEST</strong></span> of showing any <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>MIRACLE</strong></span> to the Pagans</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The pagan Meccans, in an attempt to test Muhammad's claims further, sought assistance from the Jews. The Jews sent them three challenging questions, which should serve as a Test i.e. if Muhammad could answer those questions through revelation from Allah. </p>
<p>When the Meccans presented these questions to Muhammad, he struggled to provide answers for a period of 15 days (as he was gathering information from people, instead of getting any information through revelation). He then attributed this delay to the absence of Gabriel, claiming that the presence of a puppy in his home prevented the angelic visitation.</p>
<p>Imam Syuti documented the following tradition in his commentary concerning this verse<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;tAyahNo=23&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">18:23 (link)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أخرج ابن المنذرعن مجاهد، أن قريشاً اجتمعت فقالوا: " يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، فما هذا الدين الذي جئت به؟ قال: هذا دين جئت به من الرحمن. فقالوا: إنا لا نعرف الرحمن، إلا رحمن اليمامة - يعنون مسيلمة الكذاب - ثم كاتبوا اليهود فقالوا: قد نبغ فينا رجل يزعم أنه نبي، وقد رغب عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، ويزعم أن الذي جاء به من الرحمن. قلنا: لا نعرف الرحمن إلا رحمن اليمامة، وهو أمين لا يخون.. وفيّ لا يغدر.. صدوق لا يكذب، وهو في حسب وثروة من قومه، فاكتبوا إلينا بأشياء نسأله عنها. فاجتمعت يهود فقالوا: إن هذا لوصفه وزمانه الذي يخرج فيه. فكتبوا إلى قريش: أن سلوه عن أمر أصحاب الكهف، وعن ذي القرنين، وعن الروح. فإن يكن الذي أتاكم به من الرحمن، فإن الرحمن هو الله عز وجل، وإن يكن من رحمن اليمامة فينقطع. فلما أتى ذلك قريشاً أتى الظفر في أنفسها فقالوا: يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائك... فحدثنا عن أمر أصحاب الكهف وذي القرنين والروح. قال: ائتوني غداً. ولم يستثن، فمكث جبريل عنه ما شاء الله لا يأتيه، ثم أتاه فقال: سألوني عن أشياء لم يكن عندي بها علم فأجيب حتى شق ذلك عليّ. قال: ألم ترنا لا ندخل بيتاً فيه كلب ولا صورة؟ - وكان في البيت جرو كلب - ونزلت { ولا تقولن لشيء إني فاعل ذلك غداً إلا أن يشاء الله واذكر ربك إذا نسيت وقل عسى أن يهدين ربي لأقرب من هذا رشداً } من علم الذي سألتموني عنه أن يأتي قبل غد؟ ونزل ما ذكر من أصحاب الكهف ونزل{ ويسألونك عن الروح... } [الإسراء: 85] الآية ".</p>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic">... Quraysh (the pagan tribe of Muhammad) wrote to Jews that there had appeared a person among them, who claims himself to be a prophet, and he had left the religion of their ancestors ... Jews replied: "Asked him 3 questions about the Ashab-e-Kuhf (The people of Cave), Dhulqarnain ("the Two-Horned One") and Ruh (i.e. the Spirit) ... Quraysh became happy upon it and they said to Muhammad: "If you have already left the religion of our ancestors, then tell us about Ashab-e-Kuhf (The people of Cave), Dhulqarnain, and the spirit."  Muhammad said to them: "Come to me tomorrow (and I will reply)." But Muhammad forgot to say Insha-Allah (i.e. if Allah wills). <strong>Gabriel came to him after only 15 days.</strong> Muhammad said to Gabriel: "Quraysh came to me and they asked me about somethings (as a test of my prophethood), which I didn't know. Thus, I was in a very difficult state during this period." Gabriel replied: <em><strong>"Have you not seen we (i.e. angels) don't enter a house which has a dog or a picture? And there was a puppy in your house (who entered the house and Muhammad didn't know about it).</strong></em>" Upon that this verse was revealed: [... <em><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>and do not enquire about those questions from any one of them<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"> (i.e. Muhammad was collecting information about those 3 questions from people during those 15 days)</span></strong></span>.</em> <em><strong>And never say of anything, "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow," Except (when adding), "If Allah wills</strong>." </em>Quran 18:22-24] </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual situation was as under:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muhammad neither knew the answers to the three questions nor was he in contact with any Allah or angel.</li>
<li>Consequently, Muhammad began <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>enquiring about those questions from others (<span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);">and the Quran (verse <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/18/22/default.htm">18:22</a>) is itself a witness of this action of Muhammad</span>)</strong></span>. It took him 15 days to gather some information about those 3 questions. </li>
<li>Later Muhammad made an excuse that he was unable to answer the questions the next day, as he had forgotten to say Insha-Allah (if God wills). And he claimed that a puppy entering his house prevented Gabriel from delivering the answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, those answers from Muhammad (which consisted of alleged divine revelation), were not only "incomplete", but Muhammad (and his Allah) were not even able to understand the original Jewish questions. </p>
<h2>Background of the 3 Jewish Questions:</h2>
<p>(The following information is provided by Adam ElMasri in his video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSFwSvX1RoU">Link</a>), along with some additions made by us)</p>
<h3>The First Question:</h3>
<p>For a long period before Islam began, both Christians and Jews tried to classify and canonize the books of the Bible. A few decades prior to Islam, an interesting dispute arose between Christians and Jews, precisely around the prophetic books. The Jewish Bible is divided into three sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>Torah (the first 5 books that consist of the law),</li>
<li>Ketovim (which means the writings),</li>
<li>and Navieem (which means the prophets).</li>
</ol>
<p>When it came to classifying and canonizing <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16484">The Book of Denial</a>, a big argument occurred between some Jewish rabbis and other Jewish sects and Christians about whether the book of Daniel should be included in the Navieem (writing) section or in the Ketovim (prophets) section.</p>
<p>In fact, the core argument was about whether Daniel is a prophet or not!</p>
<p>Jews then canonized the book of Daniel in the Ketovim (writings ... i.e. Daniel (Arabic: <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84"><span dir="rtl">دانيال</span></a>) was not a prophet), while Christians placed the book of Daniel in the prophets (Navieem). The debate continued for decades.</p>
<p>Daniel himself claimed that he had seen a <strong>vision</strong>. But in Rabbinic sources, there is a clear distinction between a <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);">prophetic vision</span></strong> and a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>prophecy</strong></span> through <span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);"><strong>the spirit of God</strong></span>, which is called in Hebrew <strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);">Ruach ha Kodesh</span></strong>, in Arabic Al Rouh el Kodos <span class="mw-page-title-main"><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3">الروح القدس</a> </span>or the Holy Spirit, sometimes referred to simply as The Spirit – Ha Ruach – Al Rouh الروح. This is the spirit that the Jews asked Muhammad about, and he had no clue what they were talking about.</p>
<p>The prophethood of Daniel was a hot debate topic, whether he was a prophet or not, until just a few decades before Muhammad. Therefore, the Jews believed that if Muhammad was truly a prophet of God, he would be able to resolve this dispute. Thus, they asked Muhammad this question. However, Muhammad disappeared for 15 days trying to find clues with no luck. So he came back with this answer: (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.85">17:85</a>):"They ask you about the Spirit. Say: '<em>The Spirit is by command of my Lord, and you have not been given of knowledge except a little.</em>'"</p>
<p>In essence, Muhammad evaded answering the this question completely by using the excuse that only limited knowledge about the spirit is granted to humans.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1735365/jewish/Why-Isnt-the-Book-of-Daniel-Part-of-the-Prophets.htm">Why Isn’t the Book of Daniel Part of the Prophets?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The 2nd Question:</h2>
<p>There existed two famous (but very much similar) stories at that time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one was in the Book of Daniel (in the Bible) involving 3 young Jewish men.  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%203%3A8-30&amp;version=NIV"><strong>Daniel 3:8-30 (NIV)</strong></a> . And the Jews beleived in it. </li>
<li>The second story was about "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seven-Sleepers-of-Ephesus">The Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus</a> (i.e. The people of the Cave)", which involved 7 Christian people (with some versions mentioning 8 people. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seven-Sleepers-of-Ephesus">Link</a>). It was not even a part of the Bible. and the Jews didn't even believe in it (but opposed it, as it was telling about 3 faithful Christians, who were enemies of the Jews).  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Jews asked Muhammad about the first strory from the Book of Daniel (in the Bible). But Muhammad and his Allah got confused, and thought it was about the 2nd story of the Christian legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus (i.e. The people of the Cave).</p>
<p>The resemblance between the story of the three young men in the Book of Daniel and the legend of the seven sleepers lies primarily in their themes of faith, divine protection, and miraculous preservation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Faith and Divine Protection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three Young Jewish Men in the Book of Daniel</strong>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown into a fiery furnace for refusing to worship a golden statue set up by King Nebuchadnezzar. Their unwavering faith in God led to their miraculous preservation. An angel protected them, and they emerged from the furnace unharmed, demonstrating God's power and their faith.</li>
<li><strong>Legend of the Seven (or Eight) Sleepers</strong>: This Christian legend (which was not a part of the Bible) tells of seven or eight young Christian men who hid in a cave to escape persecution for their faith. They fell asleep and miraculously awoke centuries later, unharmed and unchanged, during a time when Christianity was no longer persecuted. Their story is seen as a testament to divine protection and the enduring nature of faith.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Miraculous Preservation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three Young Men</strong>: The miracle here is their survival in the fiery furnace without any harm, symbolizing God's direct intervention and protection.</li>
<li><strong>Seven (or Eight) Sleepers</strong>: The miracle is their prolonged sleep and preservation over centuries, which serves as a sign of God's care and the passage of time without physical change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to resemblance in these two stories, the people (whom Muhammad enquired for information) got confused, which made Muhammad ultra confused as a result. Thus, Muhammad mixed the both stories and clamed their numbers exactly from 3 to eight in the Quran.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=18&amp;verse=22">18:22:</a></p>
<p><span>سَیَقُولُونَ ثَلَـٰثَةࣱ رَّابِعُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡ وَیَقُولُونَ خَمۡسَةࣱ سَادِسُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡ رَجۡمَۢا بِٱلۡغَیۡبِۖ وَیَقُولُونَ سَبۡعَةࣱ وَثَامِنُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡۚ قُل رَّبِّیۤ أَعۡلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِم مَّا یَعۡلَمُهُمۡ إِلَّا قَلِیلࣱۗ فَلَا تُمَارِ فِیهِمۡ إِلَّا مِرَاۤءࣰ ظَـٰهِرࣰا وَلَا <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>تَسۡتَفۡتِ</strong></span> فِیهِم مِّنۡهُمۡ أَحَدࣰا</span></p>
<p><span>They will say there were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>three</strong></span>, the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">fourth</span></strong> of them being their dog; and they will say there were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>five</strong></span>, the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">sixth</span></strong> of them being their dog - guessing at the unseen; and they will say there were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>seven</strong></span>, and the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">eighth</span></strong> of them was their dog. Say, [O Muhammad], "My Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows them except a few. So do not argue about them except with an obvious argument <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>and do not <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">inquire <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">(arabic:  تَسۡتَفۡتِ)</span></span> about them from anyone among them.</strong></span>" (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=18&amp;verse=22">Translated by Corpus Quran</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, the question is, why was Muhammad <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>ENQUIRING</strong></span> others about these questions? This alone is enough to understand that the answers were not delivered to him by any angel, but rather, he gathered information by <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>Enquiring</strong></span> from people during those 15 days. People were not fools, and they were able to see Muhammad asking people about those information. They started making fun of his Allah. Thus, Muhammad wanted to deflect the blame from his Allah and thus showed if he was enquiring about them from people on his own, while his Allah later stopped him from doing it.</p>
<p>Muhammad claimed that his Allah was 100% perfect and all-knowing. Therefore, it was crucial for Muhammad to keep his Allah free from any accusations of ignorance or shortcomings. To achieve this, Muhammad often employed the tactic of taking the blame upon himself to deflect any criticism from his Allah. An example of this can be seen in the incident of the <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/85-satanic-verses-the-original-incident-exposing-muhammad-revelation">Satanic Verses (Quran 17:73-75)</a>, where he assumed full responsibility for the Satanic Verses, thereby absolving his Allah of any fault.</p>
<p>Secondly, on one hand, Muhammad asserted that Allah possessed precise knowledge of the number of people in the cave, but on the other hand, Allah did not disclose the exact figures. The question arises: Why? One wonders, <strong><span style="color: rgb(230, 126, 35);">what potential harm would have arisen if Allah had revealed the precise numbers of the people in the cave</span></strong>? </p>
<p>Thirdly, Please also note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original story in the Book of Daniel involved 3 young men.</li>
<li>The Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus involved 7 people (with some versions mentioning 8), who were sleeping in the cave.</li>
<li>Thus, Muhammad mixed both of these stories and came to the figures of 3 to 8 in the Quran. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fourthly, this legend was not even a part of the Bible, but only a later made legend by Christians. And Jews could not have asked about this Christian legend, as it is about PIOUS and Faithful Christian men, which went against Jewish beliefs. </p>
<h3>The 3rd Question:</h3>
<p>Then the Jews asked about the story of the ram with 2 horns in the Book of Daniel. However, Muhammad got confused and thought that the Jews were asking about Alexander the Great (who was also historically known as "the Two-Horned One."). </p>
<p>The Book of Daniel describes a vision of a ram with two horns in Chapter 8, in the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 8:3-4 (NIV):</strong></p>
<p>I looked up (in the vision), and there before me was a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>ram with two horns</strong></span>, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. I watched the ram as it charged toward <span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);"><strong>the west and the north and the south</strong></span>. <strong>No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power</strong>. It did as it pleased and became <strong>great</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel 8:20 (NIV):</strong></p>
<p><strong>The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia </strong>... <span id="en-NIV-21985" class="text Dan-8-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>“In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise.</span> <span id="en-NIV-21986" class="text Dan-8-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people.</span> <span id="en-NIV-21987" class="text Dan-8-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Muhammad falsely thought that the Jews were asking the question about the story of Alexander the Great, who was also historically known as "the Two-Horned One."  In Hellenistic culture, Alexander the Great was depicted with horns, symbolizing divinity and power. For example, coins from the era of Alexander depict him with ram's horns, which were associated with the Egyptian god Amun. Alexander was declared the son of Amun in the Siwa Oasis, and this imagery was used to represent his divine status and authority.</p>
<p>The Quranic Arabic word "Dhulqarnain" itself literally means "<strong>the two-horned one.</strong>"</p>
<p>And then Muhammad gave the following answer about this story, in which Dhulqarnain goes to the West and no one could stand against him. Later he went to the East, and again no one could stand against him. Then he went to the North, and again no one could stand against him. </p>
<p>The story of Dhul-Qarnain is found in Surah Al-Kahf (Chapter 18) of the Quran, verses 83-101. Dhul-Qarnain is presented as a righteous and powerful ruler who embarks on three major expeditions across the world, guided by divine wisdom and justice. Here is a summary of his story and expeditions:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Expedition: The Western Expedition</strong></span></p>
<p>Dhul-Qarnain's first journey takes him to the far west, where he reaches the setting place of the sun, described as a "murky spring." There, he finds a people living in that region. God gives him the choice to either punish them or treat them with kindness. Dhul-Qarnain chooses justice, rewarding those who do good and punishing wrongdoers. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Second Expedition: The Eastern Expedition</strong></span></p>
<p>His second journey takes him to the far east, where he finds a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third Expedition: The Northern Expedition and the Barrier</strong></span></p>
<p>In his final and most famous expedition, Dhul-Qarnain travels to a region between two mountains. There, he encounters a people who seek his help against the tribes of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj), who are causing great corruption and havoc. Dhul-Qarnain agrees to help them and constructs a massive barrier of iron and molten copper between the mountains, effectively containing Gog and Magog. He declares that this barrier will hold until the Day of Judgment when God will cause it to collapse.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad failed to provide a clear answer regarding the true identity of Dhulqarnain, leading to ongoing confusion among Muslims. The vague response given by the Quran and Muhammad perpetuated an endless cycle of uncertainty. This confusion is exemplified by various contradictory statements.</p>
<p>Firstly, Muslim apologists claimed that it was <strong>Alexander the Great</strong> who was Dhulqarnain. But then the problem occurred that historical and archaeological evidence reveals that Alexander the Great was a polytheist who believed he was the literal son of Greek and Egyptian gods. Moreover, the version of the Quran includes Alexander building a huge iron wall (Gates of Alexander) to trap the people of Gog and Magog behind, which will be broken at the end of times. However there's no evidence this wall exists at all, and Muslims suddenly started claiming 'it's somewhere underground' once Google Maps became a thing.</p>
<p>Thus, Islamic apologists tried to shift the identity of Dhul Qarnayn from Alexander to other prominent historical kings, such as <strong>Cyrus the Great</strong>. However, that shift holds very little evidence and has major flaws compared to the overwhelming evidence that the story is actually based on the Syriac legend of Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's not going to be Cyrus either, because, like Alexander, he also prayed to and tolerated pagan deities and religions, not very Islamic.</p>
<p>Muslims have to suffer for centuries due to all these contradictions, while Muhammad (and his Allah) were not able to tell clearly about the story of ram with two horns. </p>
<h2>Islamist apologist: How can you be sure that the Jews asked questions from the Book of Daniel?</h2>
<p>An apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But how do you know that they were asking about the book of Daniel? It seems you just put your own interpretation of the questions and blame Muhammad for not using the same interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Just use common sense, and everyone can easily see the Truth. </p>
<p>Muslims did not preserve any Jewish or Pagan writings or oral narratives for future generations, which could have provided their version of the story. Thus, we are left only with the Quran and Muslim traditions. However, as humans, we have <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">COMMON SENSE</span></strong> and can still deduce conclusions from surrounding evidences.</p>
<p>Please consider these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why would the Jews ask about a Christian legend instead of the original Bible? How could they ask about something that contradicted their beliefs, as they did not consider Christians to be faithful and righteous people?</li>
<li>And why did Muhammad/Allah became confused about the exact numbers of person? How did Muhammad (and his Allah) mentioned EXACTLY the figures of 3 to 8? </li>
<li value="3">And what harm had it caused, if Allah would have told the exact numbers?</li>
<li>What purpose would it serve for the Jews to ask about the <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>INFIDEL</strong></span> Alexander the Great and his achievements?</li>
<li>What interest would there be for the Jews in asking about the "Human Spirit"? But surely, they had a great interestest in SOLVING the great DISPUTE, if the vision shown by the "<strong>Spirit of God</strong> <a class="relative pointer-events-auto a
  
  
  
  
  hover:underline
  " href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">الروح القدس</a>" is an evidence of prophethood or not. </li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, consider this: <strong>How many pagans or Jews converted to Islam due to Muhammad's answers to these questions?</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps none.</p>
<p>If Muhammad had miraculously provided correct answers to these three questions through revelation, <strong>it would be logical to expect a significant number of pagans and Jews to convert to Islam due to this miracle</strong>. <strong>However,<em><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"> it appears that not a single Pagan/Jew converted to Islam as a result of these revelatory answers</span></em></strong><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">.</span></em> Why?</p>
<p>In the second part of this series, we saw that pagans and Jews constantly asked Muhammad to show them any miracle. The Quran records many excuses from Muhammad for his inability to show any miracle, <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><em><strong>but neither Muhammad nor the Quran once used these three answers as proof of miracle</strong></em></span>. Why?</p>
<p>Moreover, please also reflect on this question: "Was there any <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>MIRACOLOUS Information</strong></span> present in the 3 answers that Muhammad provided"? The story of Alexander the Great was well-known among the masses, as was the story of the sleepers in the cave.  And would it not be logical that Allah would have told the exact numbers, so that Muhammad should not have to enquire their numbers from them? Similarly, how can Muhammad's response, “The Spirit belongs to the domain of my Lord; and you were given only little knowledge,” be considered "<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>miraculous information</strong></span>?" Please ask this question to yourself, if it was not possible for any false prophet to gather such superficial (non-miraculous information) during those 15 days? </p>

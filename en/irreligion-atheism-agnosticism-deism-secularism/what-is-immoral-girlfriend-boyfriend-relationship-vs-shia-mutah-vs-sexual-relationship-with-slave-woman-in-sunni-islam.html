        <p>Islamic preachers, both Shia and Sunni, argue that a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship is equivalent to fornication and is immoral. Let's examine their claims.</p>
<h2>A question from Shia apologists: What differentiates a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship from Shia Mutah?</h2>
<p>Dear Shia Muslims!</p>
<p>Please ponder upon it that Mutah doesn't require a witness. If a girl and a boy both consent, they can perform Mutah privately, without any witnesses. This consent is similar in both Mutah and the girlfriend/boyfriend relationship. So, how does Mutah become a blessing while the girlfriend/boyfriend relationship becomes obscene and immoral?</p>
<p>When posed with this question, Shia apologists typically respond by highlighting two key differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mutah has an 'iddah (waiting period), whereas a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship lacks such a period.</li>
<li>In Mutah, the father is responsible for the child's expenses if a child is born.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>There is no waiting period for a minor girl in Shia Islam. She does not need any waiting period in order to enter into the next Mutah relationship and can be immediately handed over to another man by her guardian in Mutah. Similarly, an old woman also does not need any waiting period for the next Mutah in Shia Islam (<a href="https://www.al-islam.org/five-schools-islamic-law-muhammad-jawad-mughniyya/al-iddah">link</a>).</p>
<p>Shia scholars explain that a minor girl or an old woman doesn’t need the waiting period while this waiting period is only meant to determine the parentage of the child, just like in Sunni Islam the ‘iddah (waiting period) of prisoner or slave woman is to become free of first menstruation blood in three to seven days, as it happened in case of Saffiyyah that she became free of her menstruation blood the day that Muslims killed his father, brother and husband, and Muhammad than had sex with her the same night. </p>
<p>Therefore, if, according to Shia Ulama, the waiting period was solely intended for determining the parentage of the child, then it's arguable that observing this waiting period is unnecessary in modern times. After all, a quick medical test can easily establish whether a woman is pregnant or not, and DNA testing can identify the father of the child.</p>
<p>So, why do Shia apologists still consider a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship immoral, even though the issue of parentage has been resolved?</p>
<p>In response to the second argument - that the father takes responsibility for the child in Mutah and bears the expenses - it can be pointed out that in Western countries, the boyfriend also takes responsibility as the father of the child. If he refuses, then courts will compel the father to provide for the child financially, regardless of whether the parents are married or not. The child also has rights to the father's property, just like any other child born within a traditional marriage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the father wants to participate in the upbringing of the child alongside the mother, courts often grant them this right. The father may even gain full custody of the child if the mother is deemed unsuitable for raising the child.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;"><em>While Mutah is perpetrating injustice against the mother in this case, if a woman becomes pregnant through Mutah and gives birth to a child, the father will obtain custody of the child, leaving the mother completely deprived of her infant. Please see, is this not an injustice towards the mother?</em></span></p>
<h3>A sexual relationship with a slave woman (i.e. her RAPE) in Sunni Islam is a crime against humanity</h3>
<p>Dear Sunni Muslims!</p>
<p>Islamic apologists are strange. They blame Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationships as being immoral, but they forget that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Islam allows the owner to rape the slave/captive woman without her consent. However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. </li>
<li>And this rape is done in TEMPORARY sexual relationships (just like Shia Mut'ah). This means when the Muslim owner fulfilled his lust and got bored of her, then he handed her over to his brother or slave. And once all of his brothers and slaves also fulfilled their lust and raped her one by one, then she was sold to the 2nd master, while the 1st master bought a new slave girl from the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery and started raping that new slave girl. And the 2nd master again raped the poor slave girl and then sold her to the 3rd master ... and thus the rape of the poor slave girl continued by multiple Muslim men. <br />However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. </li>
<li>There is no witness needed if an owner wants to have sex with his slave woman. Again, there is no witness needed if the owner hands her over to any of his brothers or slaves to rape her. <br />However Islamic apologists still blame the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship for being immoral unilaterally, while they don't need any witness for their relationship. Nevertheless, they forget the absence of witnesses in the case of Islam. </li>
<li>If a slave girl is the property of 2 to 5 owners, then all of them can rape her one by one. In this case, the child will have 2 to 5 OFFICIAL fathers.<br />However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. </li>
<li>If the owner becomes doubtful about the child (while he handed her over to his slaves or brothers in temporary sexual relationships), then he can also deny the parentage of his own child. In this case, his own son/daughter will become his slave, and he is allowed to make money by selling his own son/daughter in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery as slaves. <br />However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. </li>
<li>If the Muslim owner gets lust for the wife of his slave, then Islam allows him that he can break their family, and take the wife of his slave for himself. And after raping her and fulfilling his lust, she gave return her to his slave. <br />However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. </li>
<li>If a Muslim man gets lust for the slave girl of another Muslim owner, then Islam allows them to SWAP their slave girls with each other, and rape the poor slave girls. <br />However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral.</li>
<li>The child always belonged to the owner, while the slave mother of that child had no right to custody of her child. The owner can sell her to any other person in the original Islamic Sharia. <br />However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. </li>
</ol>
<p>You will find all proofs about these Islamic Rulings in the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../islamic-slavery/crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity.html">The Crimes of Islamic Slavery Against Humanity</a></li>
<li><a href="../women-and-hijab/islam-prohibited-hijab-for-slave-women-and-kept-their-breasts-naked.html"> Islam Prohibited Slave Women from wearing the Hijab or even Covering Their Naked Breasts in Public</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: Shia Islam also has 100% exactly the same Rulings as Sunni Islam has when it comes to the rape of slave girls. Please read <a href="../../enc882.html?catid=10">Rape of slave women in Shia Islam</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Sunni and Shia Muslims, </p>
<p>Please don't forget that you are humans first, and Muslims/Sunni later. Humanity demands that you ponder upon these facts and decide about the truth with justice and without any bias. </p>

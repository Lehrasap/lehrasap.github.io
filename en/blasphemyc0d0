			<title>Abu Bakr's Blasphemy: Go and SUCK  the clitoris of pagan goddess al-Lat</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/54/19" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 2731</a>:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>... ('Urwa, the ambassador of Pagan Quraysh, said to Muhammad) O Muhammad! Won’t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon that, Abu Bakr replied with these dirtiest possible abusive words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #020eff;"><em>امْصُصْ بَظْرَ اللاَّتِ</em></span></p>
<p><em>“<span style="color: #fe0000;"><strong>Go suck the clitoris of (your female goddess) Al-lat</strong>”</span>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">Prophet Muhammad didn't intervene to stop or rebuke or punish Abu Bakr for his actions, and his silence on the matter is seen as support, known as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hazriah-Hasan/publication/336374711_PROPHETIC_SUNNAH/links/5d9ef1e0a6fdcc04fac678ad/PROPHETIC-SUNNAH.pdf">Taqriri Hadith</a> according to Islamic Rules, ultimately making it an established "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sunnah</strong></span>" of the Prophet and a part of Islamic Sharia law.</p>
<p class="western">Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani wrote (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020134752/http://qandabenefits.com/1984/explanation-of-hadith-of-abu-bakr">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">As the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) was <strong>silent</strong> on saying of Abu Bakr and didn’t rebuke him,<strong> it shows the permissibility of using these words</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The largest Islamic website on the Internet is IslamWeb.Net. They provided the following explanation for the use of abusive words by Abu Bakr and the reaction of Prophet Muhammad to it (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200924073257/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa%2F209491%2Fclearing-the-misconception-about-abu-bakrs-verbal-abuse-of-urwah" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>... <span style="color: #020eff;"><strong>(do you) makes no difference between the One True God (i.e. Allah) and the false gods (of non-Muslims)</strong></span>;  ...  </em><span style="color: #fe0000;"><em><strong>insulting the god of non-Muslims is an act by which one gets closer to Allaah and it is an act of obedience</strong></em></span><em>۔۔۔  (Additionally, this website Islamweb.net recorded the opinions of early Muslim scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Hajar, and Ibn Qayyim, who all praised this usage of abusive words by Abu Bakr and declared it to be a part of Sharia)</em><em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">Please also note that there was no insult or abuse present in the words of 'Urwah (i.e. the ambassador of polytheists of Quraysh), and he was only telling his opinion <strong>as Muslims had already run away once during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Uhud" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Battle of Uhud</a>, leaving Muhammad alone</strong>. So, how does it become blasphemy if 'Urwa mentioned his opinion that he felt that Muslims would once again leave Muhammad alone on the battlefield?</p>
<p class="western">It is human nature when people lose their argument (especially those who are not well-civilized), then they become aggressive and abusive. The same thing happened with Abu Bakr and Muhammad and they became aggressive and abusive towards 'Urwah.  As 'Urwah was an ambassador, a more diplomatic and civilized response would have been appropriate from Abu Bakr and Muhammad. </p>
<h2>Distortion (Tehrif تحريف) of Abu Bakr's Abusive Words by Dishonest Muslim Translators</h2>
<p>The words uttered by Abu Bakr were so offensive that ALL Muslim translators of Sahih Bukhari distorted the translation and concealed the actual words he used.</p>
<p>One of the most widely known English translators of Sahih Bukhari is Mohsin Khan. Let us examine his distortion. He translated these words as<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> (</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/54/19">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>امْصُصْ بَظْرَ اللاَّتِ</em></p>
<p>Hearing that, Abu Bakr <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>abused</strong></span> him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Abu Bakr not only abused him, but he used the words: <em>“<span style="color: #fe0000;"><strong>Go suck the clitoris of (your female goddess) Al-lat</strong>”</span>. </em>Nevertheless, Mohsin Khan hid the original words of Abu Bakr through this distortion. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Aisha Bewley (Another Translator) goes another route, instead changing the bodily anatomy that Abu Bakr ordered Urwah to suck:</p>

<p>It was not sucking the nipples of al-Lat, but Abu Bakr told him to suk the clitoris of al-Lat. </p>
<p>Even worse, the Spanish version replaces Abu Bakr’s words with entirely different words. The passage is translated as “Abû Bakr le dijo: ‘Húndete en la ignominia!’” translates into English as “Abu Bakr said to him: ‘<strong>Bury yourself in ignominy</strong>!’”</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20201122233718im_/https://theislamissue.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/wp-1581279156138.jpg" width="998" height="718" /></p>
<p>But however, we have one honest translator in the form of Michael Fishbein (a non-Muslim). He translated it absolutely correctly:</p>

<h2 class="western">1st Excuse by Islamic Apologists: 'Urwa's words were a THREAT and an ATTACK</h2>
<p class="western">Waqar Ahmad Cheema (an Islamic apologist), claimed that 'Urwa threatened Muslims, and thus Abu Bakr had the right to use harsh words against him. Mr Cheema wrote (<a href="https://www.icraa.org/abu-bakrs-befitting-response-to-a-pagan-or-an-insult-to-anothers-religion/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">‘Urwah actually threatened the Muslims. He did not just stop at that; he even went on to attribute cowardice and infidelity to the Prophet’s Companions. This was more than just a mere comment. It was an attempt to make the Prophet feel skeptical of his Companions. Therefore, it was natural for the Companions to take strong exception to these statements and respond with strong words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">Contrary to this accusation by Islamic apologists, 'Urwa's words were neither threatening nor attacking nor abusive. Here are the exact words of 'Urwa in the Hadith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">`Urwa said, "O Muhammad! Won't you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations (with your tribe Quraish)? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen (i.e. if Muhammad is attacked), by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people (i.e. Muhammad's companions), but people from various tribes <strong>who would run away leaving you alone</strong>." Hearing that, Abu Bakr said to him: "Go and suck the clitoris of your goddess al-Laat. Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet (ﷺ) alone?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">'Urwa had full right to express his opinion that the Companions of Muhammad would run away in the case of war, leaving Muhammad alone, as it had already happened once during the battle of Uhud, where companions ran away from the battlefield, leaving Muhammad alone. Muhammad was calling them from their backs, but they were not listening to Muhammad. The Quran is itself a witness to this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/3.153">3:153</a>: [Remember] when you [fled and] climbed [the mountain] without looking aside at anyone while the Messenger was calling you from behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, the words of 'Urwa were neither a threat, nor an attack, nor abusive. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Do you remember the "The Wolf and the Lamb" Fable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the fable "The Wolf and the Lamb," a thirsty lamb comes across a stream and begins to drink from it. Upstream, a wolf is also drinking, and he wants to eat the lamb. The wolf uses various excuses and false accusations to justify his intention.</p>
<p>First, the wolf claims that the lamb is making the water muddy and ruining his drinking experience. The lamb politely denies this, pointing out that he is downstream and couldn't possibly affect the wolf's water.</p>
<p>Undeterred, the wolf then accuses the lamb of insulting him the previous year. The lamb again denies this, stating that he was not even born a year ago.</p>
<p>Frustrated, the wolf then accuses the lamb's mother of disrespecting him and then he ate the lamb. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The fable illustrates how those with evil intentions may use false justifications to carry out their intentions, regardless of the truth.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And Islamic apologists are those same bloodthirsty wolves in this case, who are resorting to baseless rationalizations to legitimize Abu Bakr's offensive and indecent language.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Furthermore, if 'Urwa's words are genuinely considered a threat (or inciting scepticism), then the Quran and Hadiths contain numerous statements that are considerably more menacing than 'Urwa's utterances. By that logic, should non-Muslims also resort to using derogatory and offensive language against the Quran and Allah?</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">2nd Excuse by Islamic Apologists: The words of Abu Bakr were not abusive, but only a Proverb</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Furthermore, the Islamic apologist, Mr Cheema wrote (<a href="https://www.icraa.org/abu-bakrs-befitting-response-to-a-pagan-or-an-insult-to-anothers-religion/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The words that literally mean ‘<em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">suck the clitoris of so and so</em>’ are actually a proverb ... In fact, the proverbial phrase is not meant as an extremely offensive abuse. It is just a way to strongly condemn or point out the worthlessness of something. Consider the following line by renowned classical Arabic literary critic Ibn Rashiq al-Qayrawani (d. 463 A.H.):</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">إن الشعراء ثلاثة: شاعر، وشويعر، و ماص بظر أمه</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Literally, it would be translated as:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Verily, the poets are of three categories: an excellent poet, an ordinary poet and the one who bites the clitoris of his mother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The meaning however is that the third category is of third-class poets who produce absolute rubbish in literary terms. This is the ultimate proof that the original sense of the words is neither abuse nor obscene yelling but it is an expression used for forceful condemnation.<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Primarily, it is evident that Abu Bakr did not employ those offensive words as part of a proverb. His <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>intention</strong></span> was unequivocal: he aimed to directly <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>insult</strong></span> 'Urwa's goddess. This is evident from his modification of the phrase from "clitoris of the mother" to <strong>specifically</strong> incorporating the <strong>name</strong> of al-Laat, stating, "Go and suck the clitoris of your goddess al-Laat."</p>
<p>Consequently, it is erroneous to label Abu Bakr's offensive words as a mere proverb; their <strong>intent</strong> was undeniably to abuse and deride 'Urwa's deity.</p>
<p>This interpretation is further substantiated by 'Urwa's response to the insult, displaying his anger towards Abu Bakr's derogatory words. 'Urwa said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">...  Abu Bakr said to him: "Go and suck the clitoris of your goddess al-Laat. Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet alone?". `Urwa said, "Who is that man?" They said, "He is Abu Bakr." `Urwa said to Abu Bakr, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Actually, Islamic scholars themselves pointed out that Arabs used these words to "Abuse" their opponents, and Abu Bakr did the same, except for replacing "mother" with the goddess "al-Laat" as Abu Bakr wanted to exaggerate in abuse. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani wrote in the commentary of this Hadith (<a href="http://www.al-eman.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%20%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%AD%20%D8%B5%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%AD%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%20**/i9&amp;n240&amp;p1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">واللات اسم أحد الأصنام التي كانت قريش وثقيف يعبدونها وكانت عادة العرب <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>الشتم</strong></span> بذلك لكن بلفظ الام فأراد أبو بكر المبالغة في <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span class="index index-497" title="السب">سب</span></strong></span> عروة بإقامة من كان يعبد مقام أمه وحمله على ذلك ما <span class="index index-1822" title="الغضب">أغضبه</span> به من نسبة المسلمين إلى الفرار وفيه <span class="index index-2535" title="الجواز">جواز</span> النطق بما يستبشع من الألفاظ لإرادة زجر من بدا منه ما يستحق به ذلك</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Al-Lat is name of an idol which is worshiped by Quraish and Thaqeef. Arabs used to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>abuse </strong></span>(Arabic الشتم) with these words, but with word of ‘mother’ and Abu Bakr wanted exaggeration in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>abusing</strong></span> (Arabic سب) Urwa (who described the companions as they are not dignified people and they flee away and leave Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam)) so he used his god’s name in the place of ‘mother’. What made Abu Bakr angry to use these words is, Urwa’s description of Muslims that they flee away (and leave Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Secondly, if Muslims contend that the phrase is merely a proverb, would they permit non-Muslims to employ this same proverb in the same context? Can non-Muslims also tell Muslims to go and do the same with their revered figures or god?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If not, then why these "Double Standards"? The reason is clear that these words of Abu Bakr are so dirty and such a clear abuse and insult, that Muslims can never take these words as merely a proverb when used against their own revered figures. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The reality is, Abu Bakr used the "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>worst possible and the dirtiest abusive words</strong></span>" for insulting. There are no other words which could be dirtier or more insulting and abusive than the words of Abu Bakr. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">No reasonable Muslim would use this supposed proverb concerning the clitoris of the mother or goddess within their own family, as these are not mere proverbs but rather abusive language.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The approach of Islamic apologists is to label 'Urwa's commonplace utterance as a threat, an attack, and a grave offence, while simultaneously downplaying Abu Bakr's usage of the vilest abusive language as a mere form of mild criticism.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as "Islamophobia," as Islam is an ideology and, like all ideologies, is fully open to criticism.  </p>
<p>If Muslims face discrimination in Western countries for their identity as Muslims, it should be termed "Muslimophobia," not Islamophobia. Any Muslim living in Western societies who respects secular principles and is willing to integrate into society deserves equal human rights. Discrimination against such individuals solely for being Muslim is unjust and unacceptable.  </p>
<p>The term "Islamophobia," however, is a cleverly constructed propaganda tool. It conflates criticism of Islam as an ideology with prejudice or hatred toward Muslims as individuals. This misrepresentation serves to shield Islam from legitimate scrutiny and debate by framing any criticism as a form of bigotry.</p>

<p>These Quranic teachings are nothing else than <strong>Hate Speech</strong> against non-Muslims, who don't accept Muhammad as a prophet. </p>
<h2>Consequences of Kafirophobia</h2>
<p>Some Islamic apologists argue that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All religious texts contain passages that may be interpreted as hate speech. Therefore, singling out the Quran for criticism is an act of Islamophobia."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this argument may appear valid at first glance, a deeper look reveals important distinctions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many followers of other religions, such as Christianity and Hinduism, have undergone significant reform over time. These communities have largely adopted secular principles, distancing themselves from ancient teachings in their scriptures that may promote intolerance or hostility. As a result, hate speech in their religious texts is no longer followed in practice, nor is it widely endorsed by their religious leaders.</li>
<li>In these reformed traditions, religious texts, such as the Bible or Vedas, are openly subject to critique without triggering widespread accusations of "Bibleophobia" or "Vedophobia." </li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, many Islamic scholars and communities continue to hold literal interpretations of certain Quranic verses that advocate intolerance toward Kafirs (non-believers). Attempts to critique these verses are often met with strong resistance, labeled as "Islamophobia," which conflates legitimate criticism of ideology with prejudice against individuals.</p>
<p>The debate around "Islamophobia" should differentiate between criticism of religious ideologies and discrimination against individuals. Genuine reform requires an open dialogue about the teachings within religious texts without conflating such discussions with hate or prejudice.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Some Islamic apologists argue that Islam allows non-Muslims to criticize it. However, in practice, this claim does not hold true. The Quranic teachings and societal norms in many Islamic countries have created an environment where any criticism of Islam is automatically labeled as <em>blasphemy</em> or framed as causing "disturbance of societal harmony."</p>
<p>This leads to severe consequences, such as imprisonment or worse, for those who critique Islam. As a result, it is nearly impossible to find any books or materials in Islamic countries that openly criticize Islam. The practical implementation of such laws and societal pressures effectively suppresses freedom of expression for non-Muslims in these regions.</p>
<h3>Consequences of Kafirophobia on the <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Public Level</span></h3>
<p>In Western countries, instances of job discrimination against Muslims often lead to protests and public outcry, framed as acts of <em>Islamophobia</em>.</p>
<p>However, in many Islamic countries, sermons and public speeches in mosques sometimes include messages that emphasize exclusivity in the name of KAFIR, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encouraging Muslims not to take Kafirs (non-Muslims) as friends.</li>
<li>Advising against participating in non-Muslim festivals or social gatherings, promoting a form of social boycott.</li>
<li>Stressing the belief that And all Kafirs are one nation (الكفر كله ملة واحدة) while all Muslims are another nation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, look how this Saudi Grand Mufti is <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>OPENLY</strong></span> propagating hate speech against non-Muslims through Quranic verses (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150108164001/https://islamqa.info/en/88088">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly the Muslim should <strong>hate</strong> the enemies of Allaah and disavow them, because this is the way of the Messengers and their followers. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): </p>
<p><em>“Indeed, there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you,<strong> hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allaah Alone</strong>” </em><em>[al-Quran, Surah al-Mumtahanah 60:4] </em></p>
<p><em>“You (O Muhammad) will not find any people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, <strong>making friendship</strong> with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), <strong>even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people)</strong>. For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rooh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself” </em><em>[al-Quran Surah al-Mujaadilah 58:22]</em> </p>
<p>Based on this, it is not permissible for the Muslim to feel any love in his heart (for them). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider how much controversy would arise if the Pope were to publicly promote similarly hostile views toward Muslims. The statements of the Saudi Mufti, who operates the largest Fatwa website, carry significant weight within his community, similar to the influence of the Christian Pope in the Christian world. In fact, his words often have more impact on the Muslim public than the Pope’s do on Christians.</p>
<p>The open preaching of this Kafirophobia all over in all Islamic countries results in extreme hatred against Kafirs on the Public and Society levels, where Islamic fanatics (on the individual level) kill thousands of Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, Ahmadis and Shias alone in Pakistan (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_discrimination_in_Pakistan">link</a>). </p>
<p>What makes this situation more concerning is that these views are not isolated to just one Saudi Mufti, but are openly promoted by millions of Islamic preachers across the Islamic world. This message is openly propagated in mosques without any scrutiny or criticism. </p>
<p>This becomes even more sacrier while in the Western countries, Islamic preachers are fully successful in preaching Kafirophobia and making majority of the Muslims (who reside in the Western countries) to believe in it. There is hardly any check upon it as it is written in the Quran. </p>
<p>The injustices and bloodshed due to Quranic teachings of Kafirophobia are thousands of times bigger than any Muslimophobia in Western countries, but still, we only hear about Islamophobia in the media, but nothing against this Kafirophobia. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>When State Agencies and the Muslim Public <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Collaborate</span> to Oppress Non-Muslim Minorities</h2>
<p>When a Muslim woman wearing a hijab faces harassment in Western countries, the term <em>Islamophobia</em> is rightly brought to the forefront to highlight the issue.</p>
<p data-start="247" data-end="405">However, a far more alarming reality unfolds in some Islamic countries, where <strong data-start="325" data-end="403">police and judges actively work together to oppress non-Muslim minorities.</strong></p>
<p data-start="407" data-end="642">Reports reveal cases where <strong data-start="434" data-end="541">non-Muslim girls are abducted, forced into marriage with Muslim men, and pressured to convert to Islam.</strong> Instead of offering justice, <strong data-start="571" data-end="640">police refuse to help, and Muslim judges side with the abductors.</strong></p>
<p data-start="644" data-end="679" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For further details, please read:</p>
<p>For example, please read:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, Sindh province in Pakistan, which has the country’s largest Hindu minority, passed a bill to outlaw forced conversions. Unfortunately, this bill was not ratified by the Governor have estimated that around 1,000 girls from minority groups are forcibly converted to Islam each year.  Reference: <span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_discrimination_in_Pakistan">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_discrimination_in_Pakistan</a></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Please also read this <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-56337182">BBC News</a>. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, we hear only Western societies being accused of Islamophobia, but we hear nothing about Kafirophobia in Islamic societies. </p>
<h2>The Challenges Faced by Ex-Muslims in Islamic Societies</h2>
<p>While Ahmadis are often perceived as the most oppressed minority in the Islamic world, the plight of ex-Muslims surpasses this significantly, both at the state and societal levels.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At the State Level:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ex-Muslims often face severe consequences for leaving Islam. Many Islamic states do not recognize their right to identify as non-Muslims.</li>
<li>Apostasy is punishable by imprisonment or even the death penalty in some countries.</li>
<li>Ex-Muslims risk losing their inheritance, custody of their children, and even their spouses. These measures are rooted in strict interpretations of apostasy laws and societal intolerance.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Comparison with Ahmadis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ahmadis, while facing systemic discrimination, are not sentenced to death for their beliefs. They are allowed to live and retain their inheritance and family ties, which highlights a stark contrast in the treatment of ex-Muslims.</li>

<p>Despite the gravity of their situation, the suffering of ex-Muslims has not yet gained significant global attention. Advocacy and awareness are crucial to addressing these human rights concerns.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At the Public Level:</span></h3>
<p>In many Islamic societies, ex-Muslims face immense social pressure and harsh consequences for expressing their lack of belief. There is often a widespread societal intolerance that can lead to violent reactions, such as public harassment or even lynching. As a result, many ex-Muslims are forced to live in secrecy, concealing their true beliefs and outwardly conforming to Islamic practices, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing the five daily prayers</li>
<li>Observing the 30-day Ramadan fast</li>
<li>Attending Friday prayers</li>
<li>Studying Islamic texts at school and university</li>
</ul>
<p>This duplicity can be emotionally and mentally exhausting.</p>
<p>Ex-Muslim women face particularly harsh challenges. In addition to other things, they also have to wear the hijab throughout their lives, whether they want to or not. They are often coerced into marrying Muslim men against their will and are expected to serve their husbands for the rest of their lives. They cannot reveal their true beliefs even to their own children, who may accidentally disclose their mothers' apostasy to others. To avoid social repercussions, ex-Muslim women must raise their children as Muslims, further perpetuating the cycle of secrecy and deception. The psychological strain of living such a life can become unbearable, leading some individuals to resort to suicide as a means of escape.</p>
<p>Why all this suffering? The answer is: Only due to the disease of Kafirophobia. </p>
<p>Please go to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/">Ex-Muslim Subreddit</a> and read the stories of thousands of ex-Muslims, who are forced to live this double life in their Islamic countries. They are bleeding, they are crying, they are in pain, but the world is unaware of their sufferings. </p>
<p>Despite all this oppression, we never hear any word against this Kafirophobia, but we hear only and only Islamophobia while some Western cities didn't allow building the minarets, although they allowed the building of mosques. </p>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId108408"></a>The Disease of Kafirophobia is making Western Society POLARIZED, making the Integration of Muslims impossible</h3>
<p>Muslims didn't face any persecution in the West in the past, and they were provided with equal human rights. That is why millions of Muslims immigrated on their own to Western countries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Quranic teachings of Kafirophobia make it difficult for Muslims (especially religious Muslims) to integrate into the local community.:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Quran &amp; Sharia ask them to consider the local community to be impure Kafirs.</li>
<li>The Quran &amp; Sharia ask them to openly hate and oppose the SECULAR Liberal Laws of the local countries and openly call for the imposition of the Sharia Laws.</li>
<li>The Quran &amp; Sharia ask them not to join them in any of their celebrations and festivals. </li>
<li>The Quran &amp; Sharia ask them not to marry them. </li>
<li>The Quran &amp; Sharia ask them not even to dress like them to stop any possible integration.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The message of the Quran to Muslims is: "Rather than to integrate &amp; assimilate, you have to segregate and dominate."</p>
<p>All these Quranic teachings of Kafirophobia are making Western society extremely POLARIZED, where different groups are hostile to each other and are not ready to mix and integrate. </p>
<p>The Record of integration of Muslim communities is extremely bad as compared to any other foreign community. Their majority don’t share the mainstream societies’ views on gender equality, homosexuality and other topics — even in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation.</p>
<h2>Without Integration you have Balkanization</h2>
<p>"Balkanization" of society refers to the fragmentation or division of a society into smaller, often hostile, groups based on ethnic, religious, cultural, or other identities. This term originates from the historical geopolitical fragmentation of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe, where multiple ethnic and national groups have experienced intense conflicts and division.</p>
<p>Key Aspects of Balkanization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Fragmentation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Society is split into smaller, distinct groups that identify strongly with their own community rather than the larger society.</li>
<li>These groups may form along ethnic, religious, linguistic, or cultural lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hostility and Conflict</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The divisions often lead to tension, mistrust, and sometimes open conflict between different groups.</li>
<li>The groups may compete for resources, political power, or social influence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weakening of National Unity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overall unity and coherence of the nation-state are undermined.</li>
<li>National identity becomes less significant compared to subgroup identities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on Governance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective governance becomes challenging as the society becomes polarized.</li>
<li>Policies and decisions may be contested or blocked by different groups, leading to political instability. </li>
<li>In case of Muslims, it is giving rise to "Political Islam" in the western countries. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social and Economic Consequences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social cohesion is weakened, which can lead to decreased economic cooperation and development.</li>
<li>Communities may become isolated from each other, reducing opportunities for interaction and mutual understanding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Disease of Kafirophobia is giving birth to the Disease of "Political Islam", which aims to destroy the Secular System and impose the Sharia System</h2>
<p>The Quranic teachings of Kafirophobia are directly giving birth to the disease of "<strong>Political Islam</strong>".</p>
<p>Political Islam aims to destroy and end Secular laws and replace them with Sharia laws for everything like blasphemy, marriages, apostasy, homosexuality, gender equality etc.</p>
<p>In short, political Islam is a <strong>TRAITOR</strong> to the Secular system and it aims to break the secular system and replace it with the Sharia system. </p>
<p>Of course, as a minority, they are not able to achieve these goals. They still dream about it and find ways to implement it through different means, like increasing their population through increased birthrate and immigration. </p>
<p>Many Muslims do not even hide these malicious intentions anymore against the secular system and they openly express their intention. </p>
<div class="page-header">
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId295551"></a>Is the Western Demand for Integration from Muslims against Secularism?</h2>
</div>
<p>Islamic Preachers come up with the following argument, to defend the Quranic teachings of non-integration:</p>
<div class="com-content-article__body">
<blockquote>
<p>Secularism is against <strong>collectivism</strong> and based upon ‘<strong>individualism</strong>’ and talks about the rights and liberties of an individual person. It’s moral stance is that an individual person is allowed to do whatever he wishes to do, and let others do whatever they want to do. <strong>Therefore, when the Western people demands the ‘social integration’ from Muslim, who are living in the West, they are themselves contradicting the basics of the Liberalism/Secularism</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Response:</span></p>
<p>These Islamists are suffering from the huge disease of misunderstanding Secularism. </p>
<p>Yes, of course, Secularism gives the liberty of 'personal choice' to a person, but ONLY on an "individual &amp; personal" level. For example, if an individual person does not participate in the Christmas celebrations according to his ‘personal choice’, then there is no problem with it.  Similarly, if a Muslim woman chooses not to marry a non-Muslim based on personal preference, that decision is fully within her rights.</p>
<p>The criticism is not upon the ‘personal choice’ of an individual person, but it is upon the ‘Collective behaviour' of the  Community’, where they think that their religion has ordered them ‘collectively’ to neither marry non-Muslims, nor they are allowed to celebrate their festivals , nor they can become friends, nor to integrate with them. This is equal to NEGATING and DECEIVING Secularism by MISUSING it. </p>
<p>Other communities—whether Jewish, Christian, Hindu, or atheist—are integrating into Western societies without difficulty because they have recognized that secular values, which are rooted in a broader sense of humanity, take precedence over religious doctrines.</p>
<p>If only one community does not reform itself and does not get rid of those religious hate teachings, which go against Secular Values, then they will never be able to integrate, even if they keep on living here in Europe for the next thousands of years. </p>
<p>The takeaway is clear: humanity and Secular values must be prioritized over all religious beliefs.</p>
</div>
<h2>Excuse: But the overwhelming MAJORITY of Muslims residing in the West are "Peaceful"</h2>
<p>One Muslim friend raised this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the overwhelming numbers of Muslims in the West are peaceful people. Religious fanatics from all religions are dangerous and Muslims are no exception. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response:</strong></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, being ONLY “peaceful” is not enough.</p>
<p>Yes, being ONLY "peaceful" is not sufficient to "integrate" into the local secular society.</p>
<p>If a group of people opposes the secular system and laws, aiming to eradicate them and impose Sharia laws, either by force or through increasing their numbers in a democratic way, it is still a war against secularism. This will inevitably sooner or later lead to Balkanization, and a collision and wars of values, cultures, and communities.</p>
<p>Such a group of people has not truly accepted SECULARISM; they are merely <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>Temporarily Tolerating</strong></span> the secular system (until they gain enough power). This is not the same as being "peaceful," because this "peace" is only temporary until the inevitable point of collision.</p>
<p>Only those who are genuinely loyal to secular values, who reject and deny those Sharia rulings that conflict with secular human values on global level, deserve to be called peaceful.</p>
<p>All others, who are merely <strong>temporarily tolerating</strong> secularism, inwardly opposing it, and intending to rebel against it and destroy it once they gain enough power, are TRAITORS to the secular system and do not deserve to be called "peaceful."</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId626679"></a>“Muslimophobia” cannot be stopped as its origins lie in the Kafirophobia</h3>
<p>Muslims historically did not face persecution in the West and enjoyed equal human rights, which is why millions chose to migrate to Western countries.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of 'Political Islam' in the West, animosity towards Muslims has increased. Islamic preachers often label this opposition as Islamophobia, but it's important to note that 'Quranic Kafirophobia' itself has been the instigator of this cycle of hatred.</p>
<p>The core issue arises when Muslim preachers assert their right to propagate their religion in Western countries while simultaneously denying non-Muslims the right to preach their beliefs in Muslim-majority countries. Furthermore, in some Muslim countries, any criticism of Islam can be met with severe punishment, including death for blasphemy. These double standards inevitably fuel resentment.</p>
<p>Therefore, the crucial question is: who is truly responsible for the growing hatred against Muslims?</p>
<p>The answer is: The root cause lies with Muslims themselves, their double standards, and their persecution of non-Muslims. <strong>Until the disease of Kafirophobia ends, it will be impossible to eradicate Islamophobia.</strong></p>
<p>Islamic preachers often protest against Islamophobia, but they have never acknowledged the real root of the problem: the teachings that promote hatred against non-believers.</p>
<p>This so-called Islamophobia will persist as long as Muslims do not address and eliminate their own intolerance and injustice and hatred. Currently, Muslims are entirely focused on combating Islamophobia, while neglecting to confront and reform their own disease of Kafirophobia.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The disease of Kafirophobia stabbed in the back of humanity-loving Left-Wing Secular People:</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It was the humanity-loving left-wing Secular people of the West, who said welcome to Muslims in their countries, allowed them to immigrate and gave them EQUAL human rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">By not getting rid of the disease of Kafirophobia, by not REFORMING yourself, by not considering non-Muslims as equal humans, and by not integrating, the Muslim community only stabbed in the back of the humanity-loving left-wing forces in Western countries. It will result only in the weakening of left-wing forces and the strengthening of far right-wing forces, which will ultimately only result in increased hatred against Muslims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If the far right-wing parties are winning the elections in European countries today, then this disease of Kafirophobia is the main reason behind their rise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If you really want to reduce the hatred against Muslims and make it safer for Muslims, then you have to recognise the real cause and reform yourself first. </span></p>

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId291222"></a>Islamist's Excuse: The term Islamophobia was invented by a non-Muslim</h2>
<p>An Islamic preacher offered the following justification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was rather uninformed and foolish to assert that the term "Islamophobia" originated with Muslims when it is widely known that it was first coined by Alain Quellien, a non-Muslim Frenchman, in 1910. He used it to describe a "prejudice against Islam that is widespread among the peoples of Western and Christian civilization." Therefore, the term was introduced by a non-Muslim Westerner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>It doesn't matter who invented this terminology. Western scholars are also fallible, and their works are subject to scrutiny like any others.</p>
<p>As demonstrated earlier, the term "Islamophobia" is flawed, and any animosity towards Muslims should rightly be termed "Muslimophobia."</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> And it has also been proved that Islamists are using it as a tactic to put a ban on all types of criticism against Islam by calling it Islamophobia.</span></p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId291222"></a>Islamist's Excuse: Muslims hate the West while they invaded and killed thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Our Response:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Wars are unfortunate, but they are not the reason for the hate among Muslims against the West. But the real reasons are:</p>
<ol>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Quranic teachings of Kafirophobia</strong></li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>And the wish among Muslim masses to IMPOSE Sharia all over the non-Muslim world by force</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When Muslims were stronger, they waged many more wars and brought much more destruction against their opponents. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Look at Muhammad. He either killed ALL men of opponents or made the rest of them slaves. While all women were also made slaves and also raped. Islamic Jihadists looted all the money and goods of opponents. Muhammad also didn't spare small children (who had no role in wars), but he made them slaves too for their entire lives. It didn't end there, but Islamic Sharia also got the evil of "Slavery by Birth", and thus coming generations of those slaves were also automatically born as slaves. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, Muhammad brought <strong>100% destruction</strong> upon his opponents, which the modern West never did during any war. </p>

<p>Or consider the actions of the Islamic Caliphate of Turkey towards its opponents in Europe over the past few centuries, particularly when it held significant power. Turkey's role in the genocide of the Armenian people in 1915, serves as a stark example. The Armenian genocide, documented in detail here (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide" target="_new">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide</a>), resulted in the deaths of 1.5 million Christian Armenians.</p>
<p>Curiously absent from the discourse of Islamic preachers today is any mention of these atrocities committed against Christian Armenians, or Turkey's historical actions against Christian Europe. This selective silence may stem from the tendency for people to forgive and forget past wartime conflicts.</p>
<p>It's important to acknowledge that nobody is infallible; everyone is capable of making mistakes. While the West is not immune to errors, it has generally exhibited more restraint and compassion than Muhammad and Muslims did when they held positions of power.</p>
<p>Despite past conflicts, the West has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for forgiveness and reconciliation. Wars between European nations and Germany, as well as between the US and Japan, have not led to lasting hatred towards ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the West has extended forgiveness even towards Muslims, allowing millions of Muslims to immigrate to their countries and granting them equal human rights. It's worth noting that there is no legal obligation for Western countries to accept Muslim immigrants due to their colonial past; rather, such decisions are motivated by humanitarian considerations. Contrastingly, Islamic countries often do not extend the same hospitality to Muslims from other Islamic nations.</p>

<p>Wars were waged by governments. <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">One may understand if fanatic Islamic preachers only hate <strong>Western Governments</strong> for wars.</span> <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">No, but their hate is directed towards the <strong>Western SECULAR System</strong> itself and the Western people (the so-called Kafir non-Muslims). </span></p>
<p>These extremists reside within secular societies, yet they harbour no loyalty towards secularism. On the contrary, they vehemently oppose it, waging a relentless war against the secular order with the aim of destroying the secular system and imposing Sharia law by force.</p>
</div>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">These fanatic Islamic preachers are taking their inspiration directly from the Quranic teachings of Kafirophobia.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Pakistani Taliban waged a war against Islamic Pakistan</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Once again, the primary conflict lies not in the wars of Iraq or Afghanistan, but rather in the clash over the enforcement of the Islamic system through coercion.</p>
<p>Consider the clash between Islamic systems themselves. In 2009, the Pakistani government ceded control of the Swat region to the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in an attempt to establish Sharia law there.</p>
<p>Yet, despite this concession, the TTP continued to denounce:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Islamic Constitution of Pakistan as a "Kafir" system.</li>
<li>The Pakistani Islamic democracy as a "Kafir" system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the agreement, the Pakistani Taliban regrouped and seized control of the adjacent Buner area, advancing towards Islamabad, with the intention of imposing Sharia law by force.</p>
<p>Thus, an internal conflict erupted in Pakistan, pitting one Islamic system against another, with the former branding the latter as "Kafir." Over 70,000 Pakistani Muslims lost their lives in this intra-Islamic war, and more than 10 million were displaced, becoming refugees in their own country.</p>
<p>Considering this internal strife within Islamic Pakistan, where even its constitution, democracy, and Islamic system are rejected by Islamists, it becomes evident that they will never accept the democracy and secularism of Western nations.</p>
<p>Thus, these Islamists don't hate the Western system due to any Afghan/Iraq wars, but basically, they hate them due to the Quranic teachings of Kafirophobia, and their wish to destroy the Western system and to impose the Sharia system by force upon all non-Muslim countries. </p>]]></description>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId941640"></a>Equality of Basic Human Rights</h2>
<p>Islamic preachers often argue that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insulting the Prophet or Islam should be punishable by death, as it deeply hurts the sentiments of <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>1.5 billion</strong></span> Muslims.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this argument is fundamentally flawed because:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All humans are equal:</strong> The Prophet of Islam does not hold extra human rights compared to other individuals, regardless of their beliefs or numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Numbers do not justify special privileges:</strong> The claim that the large number of Muslims justifies granting them additional rights undermines the core principle of justice, which requires equal treatment for all individuals and groups, no matter their size.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId706830"></a>Punishment for "<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Oral</span> Insults" Cannot Be <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Physical</span> </h2>
<p>If 1.5 billion Muslims feel hurt by oral insults directed at their Prophet, then Muslims are also free to verbally insult and abuse the person responsible. If verbal insults are effective, then the combined words of 1.5 billion Muslims should suffice to emotionally impact the offending individual.</p>
<p>However, unlike Islamic law, which prescribes severe physical punishment for blasphemy, Western laws uphold a critical distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verbal conflict is resolved verbally:</strong> If someone insults or curses you, you may verbally respond in kind.</li>
<li><strong>Physical harm is prohibited:</strong> Western laws strictly forbid escalating verbal disputes into physical violence, ensuring that freedom of speech does not lead to bodily harm or injustice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Justice and equality require that everyone, regardless of religion or ideology, be treated fairly under the law. Allowing physical punishment for mere verbal offenses violates the principle of proportionality and undermines the foundation of human rights. True equality is achieved when no individual or group is granted privileges based on their beliefs or numbers, and verbal disputes are resolved without resorting to violence.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where there is a Right to <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">PREACH</span>, there is also a Right to <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">CRITICIZE</span></h2>
<p>Preaching and criticism are inseparable aspects of free expression. The right to preach one’s religion or ideology inherently includes the equal right for others to challenge or criticize those beliefs.</p>
<p>Western secular laws embody this balance, ensuring the freedom to preach under the right to Freedom of Religion while simultaneously protecting the right to criticize any religion or ideology under Freedom of Expression.</p>
<p>It is therefore unreasonable for any group—be it Islamists or others—to claim an exclusive right to preach their beliefs while attempting to suppress criticism of their religion. Unfortunately, in many Islamic countries, Muslims are permitted to preach to non-Muslims, yet non-Muslims are prohibited from criticizing Islam.</p>
<p>Free expression thrives on the coexistence of preaching and criticism, both of which are essential to fostering open dialogue and intellectual exchange.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where there is Right to <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">PRAISE</span>, there is also a Right to <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Mock/Insult</span></h2>
<p>Muslims hold Muhammad in the highest regard, viewing him as the best of mankind. They have every right to praise him as much as they wish, and no non-Muslim has the right to stop them from doing so.</p>
<p>However, non-Muslims often see Muhammad differently. They may consider him a false prophet who made questionable claims about his prophethood and revelations, with some attributing significant harm and loss of life to his actions. For many non-Muslims, the praise of Muhammad can evoke strong emotional responses and feelings of <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>hurt</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Despite this, Western secular systems uphold the <strong>right of Muslims</strong> to freely praise Muhammad under Freedom of Expression. By the same token, these systems also protect the <strong>right of non-Muslims</strong> to express their views, even if that includes mocking Muhammad or blaspheming Islam. Freedom of Expression means that Muslims must accept this reciprocal right and move on.</p>
<p>In a free society, the ability to both praise and insult is fundamental to open debate and discussion. These rights coexist:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Right to Preach = The Right to Criticize</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Right to Praise = The Right to MOCK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that there is no clear boundary between criticism and mocking/insulting. Blasphemy laws, which criminalize insults, create a climate of fear where even valid criticism can be labeled as insult, leading to the unjust punishment of individuals. To ensure the freedom to critique, it is essential that blasphemy laws do not exist.</p>
<p class="western">Thus secularism.org.uk makes this point clear in these words (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210709123017/https://www.secularism.org.uk/opinion/2021/07/naz-shahs-argument-on-blasphemy-should-be-rejected">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">Allowing people to criticise, critique and mock religion has been fundamental to <strong>human progress</strong>. If people can laugh at a religious figure, (<strong>only then) they can challenge or disbelieve them</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, true freedom of expression requires the acceptance of both praise and insult as integral aspects of discourse.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId157777"></a>Human Nature:</h2>
<p>It is a natural part of human behavior for people to become angry during discussions and debates, especially when opinions differ strongly. In such moments, harsh words and personal attacks often emerge as expressions of frustration. This understanding of human nature underpins much of Western law, which accepts emotional outbursts as part of free expression.</p>
<p>Even the writer of the Quran—whom non-Muslims believe to be Muhammad himself—demonstrated this aspect of human nature. When his opponents rejected his claims to prophethood, he reacted with anger, expressing frustration through curses and insults. Several passages in the Quran equate his opponents to animals such as donkeys, dogs, and pigs, label them "the worst of creatures," and use terms like "bastard" (زنیم in Arabic), "Impure", "Worst of Creatures",  "fools," "deaf," "blind," ... and many more such abuses. </p>
<p>Muslims attribute the Quran to Allah, claiming that it reflects divine morals of the highest standard.</p>
<p>This raises an important question: If even "Divine Allah"—believed to embody the pinnacle of morality—could not refrain from cursing and insulting his opponents in anger, how can ordinary human beings be expected to exercise better self-control? If Allah displayed such behavior, is it reasonable to demand that humans avoid harsh words or maintain higher moral standards than those attributed to Allah?</p>
<p>Moreover, the use of curses and insults in the Quran calls into question its divine origins. Such emotionally charged language and personal attacks align more closely with human imperfections than with the qualities of a perfect divine being. This is a proof that the Quran was not a divine revelation but rather the work of Muhammad, who, being human, exhibited anger and frustration when faced with opposition.</p>
<p>Similarly, Muhammad himself used to insult and curse the idols of Meccans. 'Urwa bin Zubair narrated the following Hadith:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>قال ابن إسحاق : فحدثني يحيى بن عروة بن الزبير ، عن أبيه عروة بن الزبير ، عن <span class="names">عبد الله بن عمرو بن العاص </span>، قال : قلت له : <span class="hadith">ما أكثر ما رأيت قريشا أصابوا من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فيما كانوا يظهرون من عداوته ؟ قال : حضرتهم ، وقد اجتمع أشرافهم يوما في الحجر ، فذكروا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقالوا : ما رأينا مثل ما صبرنا عليه من أمر هذا الرجل قط ، سفه أحلامنا ، وشتم آباءنا ، وعاب ديننا ، وفرق جماعتنا ، وسب آلهتنا ، لقد صبرنا منه على أمر عظيم ...</span></p>
<p><span class="hadith">Ibn Ishaaq who said: And Yahya ibn ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr told me, from his father ‘Urwah, from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas. ... He said: I was present when their prominent figures met together one day in al-Hijr. They talked about the Messenger of Allah, and they said: We have never put up with anything like that with which we are putting up with from this man. <span style="color: rgb(224, 62, 45);"><strong>He has accused us of being fools, slandered our forefathers, criticised our religion, divided us and cursed our idol gods</strong></span>,  We have endured great hardships because of him ... </span></p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId499635"></a>Blasphemy Laws: An Excuse to Ban All Criticism of Religion</h2>
<p>Islamic advocates claim that non-Muslims are allowed to criticize Islam but must not insult it. While this may sound reasonable on the surface, it raises a critical question:</p>
<p><strong>Where does criticism end and blasphemy begin?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Undefined Boundaries of Criticism and Blasphemy:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Neither Islamic Sharia nor the laws in Islamic countries clearly define the boundaries between criticism and blasphemy.</li>
<li>Without clear guidelines, what ensures that criticism of Islam will not be entirely suppressed under the guise of blasphemy?</li>
<li>This ambiguity creates a significant flaw in blasphemy laws, enabling even the mildest critique of Islam to be labeled as blasphemy, often with dire consequences for the critic.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Reality in Islamic Countries:</strong></span></p>
<p>In places like Pakistan, criticism of Islam is virtually impossible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing books or delivering speeches critical of Islam is strictly prohibited.</li>
<li>Any critique is immediately deemed blasphemous, leading to accusations, social ostracism, imprisonment, or even fatal violence.</li>
<li>Religious extremists exploit this lack of clarity, branding any dissenting opinion as mocking or insulting, effectively silencing all opposition.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Question of Double Standards:</strong></span></p>
<p>A glaring hypocrisy emerges when comparing the behavior attributed to Allah and Muhammad with the expectations placed on ordinary people:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Quran itself uses terms like "bastard" (زنیم, 68:13), "donkey," "dog," and "the worst of creatures" to describe opponents.</li>
<li>The Quran curses those who oppose it and refers to them in derogatory ways while simultaneously asserting that Muhammad embodies the highest moral character (68:4).</li>
<li>Historical accounts suggest Muhammad himself condoned or used harsh language against his detractors (You will see this later in this article).</li>
</ul>
<p>If such language is permissible for Allah and Muhammad, why are ordinary people held to a higher standard of restraint? It is unreasonable to demand that "normal humans" demonstrate greater moral discipline than those who are considered divine or divinely guided figures.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Danger of Blasphemy Laws:</strong></span></p>
<p>Blasphemy laws, as they stand, are tools for silencing criticism entirely:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lack of defined boundaries allows any critique, however reasoned, to be labeled as blasphemy.</li>
<li>This leads to unchecked suppression of free expression and enables violence against critics, perpetuating a culture of fear and intolerance.</li>
</ul>
<p>If limits on expression are to exist, they must apply equally to everyone, including Allah and Muhammad. Allowing religious figures the freedom to curse and insult while condemning others for the same behavior exposes the double standards inherent in these laws.</p>
<p>Blasphemy laws do not protect religion—they shield it from accountability. They blur the line between criticism and insult, enabling the suppression of free thought and dissent. For a truly free society, these laws must be reformed or abolished, ensuring equal rights for all individuals to express their views without fear of persecution.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId843811"></a>Muhammad approved the INSULT of the Goddess of Pagans, making it a part of Islamic Sharia:</h2>
<p><a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/54/19">Sahih al-Bukhari 2731, 2732</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>… Then ‘Urwa said, “O Muhammad! Won’t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of any one amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people,<strong> but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you (i.e. Muhammad) alone</strong>.”  Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him by saying<strong> ‘Go suck clitoris of al-Lat (i.e. the female goddes of pagans)’</strong> فَقَالَ لَهُ أَبُو بَكْرٍ <strong>امْصُصْ بَظْرَ اللاَّتِ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">Prophet Muhammad didn't intervene to stop or rebuke or punish Abu Bakr for his actions, and his silence on the matter is seen as support, known as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hazriah-Hasan/publication/336374711_PROPHETIC_SUNNAH/links/5d9ef1e0a6fdcc04fac678ad/PROPHETIC-SUNNAH.pdf">Taqriri Hadith</a>, making it an established "<strong>Sunnah</strong>" of the Prophet and a part of Islamic Sharia law.</p>
<p class="western">Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani wrote (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020134752/http://qandabenefits.com/1984/explanation-of-hadith-of-abu-bakr">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">As the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) was <strong>silent</strong> on saying of Abu Bakr and didn’t rebuke him,<strong> it shows the permissibility of using these words </strong>(for gods of non-Muslims) ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s worth noting that the exact words used by Abu Bakr were so offensive that <strong>all Muslim translators of Sahih Bukhari chose to distort them in their translations</strong> to make them appear milder. This deliberate alteration is dishonest and deeply regrettable, especially in matters of religion, where Muslims often claim moral superiority over others. Such actions undermine the integrity of religious discourse. Please read the details about this distortion and dishonesty in our article: <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/blasphemy/abu-bakr-s-blasphemy-telling-quraysh-to-go-and-suck-the-clitoris-of-their-female-goddess-al-lat">Abu Bakr's Blasphemy: Go and SUCK the clitoris of pagan goddess al-Lat</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s important to clarify that the ambassador of the Quraysh, ‘Urwah, did not insult or abuse Muhammad or the Muslims. He merely expressed his opinion, referencing the historical fact that Muslims had fled during the Battle of Uhud, leaving Muhammad behind. His comment reflected his belief that such an event could happen again. <strong>How does sharing an opinion amount to blasphemy?</strong></p>
<p>It is a common human reaction—particularly among individuals lacking civility or restraint—to become aggressive and resort to abuse when they feel they are losing an argument. This is precisely what happened with Abu Bakr and Muhammad in this instance. Rather than responding with measured diplomacy, they resorted to aggression and insults towards ‘Urwah.</p>
<p>Given ‘Urwah’s position as an ambassador, a more civilized and diplomatic response from Abu Bakr and Muhammad would have been appropriate. Resorting to abusive language not only undermined the dignity of the interaction but also failed to reflect the high moral standards they are often believed to uphold. </p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId806730"></a>Islamic Sharia Prescribes Blasphemy Laws Only for Islamic Prophets, Not for Other Religions or Their Sacred Figures</h2>
<p>Islamic teachings dictate severe consequences for those who mock Prophet Muhammad, yet they remain silent on punishing Muslims who insult the gods or sacred figures of other religions. For example, an incident involving Abu Bakr illustrates this disparity: he used highly offensive language toward a pagan goddess in Muhammad's presence, but Muhammad neither reprimanded nor punished him. This incident (discussed later in detail) underscores the selective application of blasphemy within Islamic teachings.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Modern Blasphemy Laws and Their Injustice:</strong></span></p>
<p>The unequal nature of blasphemy laws in many Islamic countries today reflects this inconsistency. For instance, in Pakistan (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_in_Pakistan">link</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Insulting Islamic prophets, including Muhammad, is punishable by <strong>death</strong> under the Pakistan Penal Code.</li>
<li>Insulting sacred figures of other religions, however, results in a <strong>maximum of three years in prison</strong>.</li>
<li>Defiling the Quran carries <strong>life imprisonment</strong>, but desecrating sacred items of other religions results in just <strong>two years in prison</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This stark disparity reveals a blatant violation of Equal Human Rights.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Root of the Inequality in Islamic Sharia:</strong></span></p>
<p>In the original Islamic Sharia, there was no prescribed punishment for insulting non-Islamic religions or their sacred figures. However, modern Islamic countries faced the challenge of justifying unrestricted insults toward other religions while demanding severe consequences for any offense against Islam. To address this, they introduced <strong>Bid'ah</strong> (innovations), criminalizing insults against other religions.</p>
<p>Even so, these laws are applied unequally. Muslims who insult other religions often escape with minimal or no consequences, while non-Muslims face disproportionately harsh punishments under blasphemy laws, especially when accused of insulting Islamic figures or beliefs.</p>
<p>This double standard violates the principles of equal rights and justice. If blasphemy laws are to exist, they must be applied equitably to all religions and sacred figures, or they risk perpetuating systemic injustice. The selective enforcement of these laws not only undermines the concept of equality but also fosters division and discrimination.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Islamic Apologists: If Western countries can make laws about the Holocaust, then why not about blasphemy?</h2>
<p>Please understand this difference: the ban on Holocaust denial is not due to 'insult,' but because of Hate Speech and is for the protection of a minority."</p>
<p>There is a huge difference between “<strong>people</strong>” and “<strong>ideology/religion</strong>”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holocaust, LGBT and laws regarding the use of the word NEGRO, are providing protection to <strong>people</strong>, from being persecuted (Hate Speech). </li>
<li>While the Blasphemy Laws are providing protection to an <strong>ideology/religion</strong> from being criticized. </li>
</ul>
<p>Holocaust laws provide protection only to <strong>PEOPLE</strong>, but they don't provide any protection for the <strong>religion of Judaism</strong>. You are free to criticize Judaism as much as you wish. </p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId213373"></a>Islamic Apologists: But the Quran forbids to abuse gods of non-Muslims.:</h2>
<p class="western">Islamic apologists often present the Quranic verse 6:108 as evidence to question the incident where Abu Bakr allegedly abused Urwa in the presence of Muhammad. The verse states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/6.108">6:108</a>: Do not revile those who invoke others apart from God, lest they begin to revile God out of malice and ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western"><strong>Response:</strong> </p>
<p>Understanding the context of this verse is crucial. It was revealed during the later years of the Meccan period when Muslims were in a vulnerable position and lived under the dominance of the Meccan polytheists (Kuffar). At that time, the Muslim community feared the power of the Meccans and lacked the strength to resist.  </p>
<p>However, the incident involving 'Urwa and Abu Bakr took place much later, during the Medinan period, specifically during the Treaty of Hudaybiah in the 6th year of Hijra. By then, the Muslims had grown significantly stronger and no longer feared the Meccans.  </p>
<p>The Quran itself reflects this progression. During the early Meccan period, its teachings were largely non-violent, focusing on patience, tolerance, and moral guidance. There were no verses advocating for fighting (Qitaal) or Jihad (war) during this phase.  </p>
<p>However, in the later Madinan period, as Muslims gained power, the tone of the Quran shifted. It began to emphasize warfare, Jihad, and the subjugation of Kuffar, often through threats and calls to violence. This evolution illustrates how the Quran’s messaging changed in response to the shifting socio-political power dynamics of the Muslim community.</p>

			<title>Using Holocaust laws to defend Islamic Blasphemy Laws</title>
			<link>https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/blasphemy/using-holocaust-laws-to-defend-islamic-blasphemy-laws</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/blasphemy/using-holocaust-laws-to-defend-islamic-blasphemy-laws</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Let us first look at the evils of Blasphemy Laws in Islamic states. </p>
<ul>
<li>Islamic Blasphemy laws are against human Nature. It is normal that people will get angered during discussions/debates and insult each other while making criticism (i.e. criticism automatically follows with insults and blasphemy).</li>
<li>Thus, the writer of the Quran (Allah/Muhammad) himself got angered in the Quran, and he cursed non-Muslims in the Quran, resembled them to dogs and donkeys, and called them filth, and the worst of animals and worst of creatures. Also, the Quran called its opponents Bastards and many more things. When Allah/Muhammad is unable to control himself against insulting others, how then do we accept normal human beings to show better morals than Allah/Muhammad? Please read our detailed article: <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/blasphemy/to-ridicule-insult-blaspheme-is-a-fundamental-human-right">Islamic Blasphemy laws are against Human Nature, thus even Allah/Muhammad cannot pass this Blasphemy Test.</a></li>
<li>And they don't stop only insulting Allah/Muhammad, but every <strong>CRITICISM</strong> of Islam is labelled as Blasphemy, and thus, punished with death. </li>
<li>You cannot publish even a single book in Islamic countries which criticizes Allah/Muhammad and Islam. You cannot deliver a single speech criticizing Islam and Muhammad.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to preach to people to leave Islam by showing the negative sides of Islam. If you dare to criticize Islam in any way, you will be put to death in an Islamic State. </li>
<li>And you cannot leave Islam in an Islamic state, i.e. leaving Islam is also labelled as an insult and blasphemy against Islam, and you will be killed for that. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>But still, Muslim preachers brainwash Muslims into believing these unjust blasphemy laws.</p>
<p>Their TACTICS are as under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every state puts some restrictions upon people, and Islam is no different. </li>
<li>Even Western countries put restrictions upon people and usurped their 'Right of Expression' through HOLOCAUST laws. </li>
<li>These same Western countries also made it a crime if people don't address LGBT people by their desired pronouns. </li>
<li>Facebook and Twitter also have their own “Community Guidelines”. Then why Muslims in an Islamic State cannot have “community guidelines” of their own?</li>
<li>Therefore, if Muslims in their Islamic countries don't want Allah/Muhammad and Islam to be insulted, then the western people have no right to protest against it. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can see these same tactics in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rELyvRDRi7E&amp;t=1951s">debate between a Muslim debater and an Atheist debater</a>. </p>
<p>Let us debunk these tactics of Muslim preachers one by one. </p>
<p><strong>Firstly:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Muslim Argument</strong>: Every state puts some restrictions upon people, and Islam is no different. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not all restrictions are the same. It depends from restriction to restriction. </li>
<li>Restriction upon '<strong>hate speech</strong>' is not the same as a restriction upon '<strong>criticism</strong>'. </li>
<li>If all restrictions are the same, then all DICTATORSHIPS will use this as an excuse for putting a ban on criticism of them and putting to death everyone who dares to do so. How are you then going to stop such a dictatorship from doing so? </li>
</ul>
<p>And Islam indeed belongs to the category of the worst kind of dictatorship, while it bans all kinds of criticism of Islam/Allah/Muhammad in the name of blasphemy, and it puts everyone to death who dares do it. And it does not let any Muslim leave Islam, without killing him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Secondly:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Holocaust law is only LIMITED to providing protection to a <strong>SMALL</strong> <strong>PERSECUTED Minority</strong>.</li>
<li>Centuries of open "Hate Speech" against the Jewish community (i.e. people), enable extremists to misuse it to bring more violence and hate against them, which leads to their further killings and other hardships. </li>
</ul>
<p>But Muslims in their Islamic countries are neither persecuted nor are a small minority, nor they are being killed. Muslims are only using blasphemy laws in order to kill anyone who dares to criticize their religion.</p>
<p>Therefore, holocaust laws can absolutely not be compared with blasphemy laws. <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">One is for the protection of a prosecuted minority</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #0010fd;">while the other is from a Majority in order to IMPOSE its OPPRESSION upon the minorities. </span></strong></p>
<p>The same is true with LGBT laws too in western countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>LGBT community is also facing violence due to centuries of open "Hate Speech" by religious fanatics, which still continue to this day. </li>
<li>Since they are a minority, they are unable to protect themselves against this centuries-old hatred. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, these LGBT laws are limited only to providing PROTECTION to this persecuted minority. How can it be then compared to the blasphemy law, which is by a Majority in order to usurp the basic human right of criticism of minorities? </p>
<p>The same is true with the use of the word <span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">NEGRO</span></strong></span>. </p>
<p>Due to centuries-old brainwashing, a bigger majority of people went to such extent in their hatred, that they used this word in order to humiliate them and to bring more hardships to them. Thus, only in order to provide protection to this minority, this word is no more used (but there is any law which declared it to be a crime to use this word). </p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong></p>
<p>There is no LGBT law which demands any use of desired pronouns by LGBT people (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/cbcdocspov/features/canadas-gender-identity-rights-bill-c-16-explained#:~:text=Bill%20C%2D16%20added%20the,religion%20and%20disability%2C%20among%20others.">link</a>). It is only false propaganda by opponents. The Muslim Preacher cited the incident of Prof. Jordan Peterson as proof. But he is wrong, as there exists no such law, and Prof. Jordan Petersen got absolutely no punishment for not using the desired pronoun for LGBT people (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson">link</a>). </p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong></p>
<p>Although Holocaust laws are there only in order to provide protection to a persecuted minority of people, still half of the Western world itself doesn't agree with them and considers it to be against the freedom of expression. Even all Islamic countries themselves consider Holocaust Laws against the freedom of expression, and none of them made a law that denying the genocide of Jews is a crime. But these same Islamic countries still want to use this same Holocaust law in order to defend their unjust blasphemy laws. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Thirdly: </strong></p>
<p>There is a huge difference between “<strong>people</strong>” and “<strong>ideology/religion</strong>”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holocaust, LGBT and laws regarding the use of the word NEGRO, are providing protection to <strong>people</strong>, from being persecuted. </li>
<li>While the Blasphemy Laws are providing protection to an <strong>ideology/religion</strong> from being criticized. </li>
</ul>
<p>Holocaust laws provide protection only to <strong>PEOPLE</strong>, but they don't provide any protection for the <strong>religion of Judaism</strong>. You are free to criticize Judaism as much as you wish. </p>
<p>The same is true with LGBT laws. There is no law which prohibits criticizing the ideology of LGBT and proves it wrong. If you believe that LGBT is unnatural, then you are free to criticize it as much as you want and no one is obstructing your right of expression. </p>
<p>But the case of the Blasphemy Law is totally different. It is there only in order to provide protection to a religion. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fourthly: Double Standards of Islam &amp; Muslims</strong></p>

</table>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Fifthly:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Muslim Argument: </strong>If Facebook/Twitter are allowed to make their own Community Guidelines, why then Islamic States cannot make their own Cummunity Laws?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a huge difference between “<strong>private property</strong>” and “<strong>public/state property</strong>”.</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter are “private organizations”.  </p>
<p>And the owners of private properties/organizations are allowed to make laws for their private properties/organizations, which are different from public laws. Facebook and Twitter have to do business in Muslim countries, which is why they make their own public guidelines according to their own business interests. </p>
<p>If a Muslim (even if he lives in the US) owns any such private organization like Facebook/Twitter, then he is fully allowed to ban any type of blasphemy/criticism of Islam. No one can compel him to do otherwise. </p>
<p>But the difference is, we have a <strong>CHOICE</strong> in case of private property/organization either to join it on not. But this CHOICE is not present in the case of public/state affairs. </p>
<p>Muslims/Islam don't own any state, but a state is owned by all its citizens on the basis of equity and justice. Thus, the laws of the state guarantee the basic human rights of each and every citizen. While blasphemy laws are usurping exactly these basic human rights of minorities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Muslims cannot hide the unjust blasphemy laws behind excuses like the holocaust and LGBT laws. They cannot deceive the whole world by making such lame excuses. </p>
<p>And if Muslims don't reform themselves, then it will only lead towards hatred against Islam and Muslims automatically for their double standards, where they want the right to preach and criticize and convert people towards Islam, but do not offer the same rights to non-Muslims in their Islamic states. </p>
<p>And this hatred against Islam &amp; Muslims is not going to go away in non-Muslim countries, despite crying for Islamophobia. It is due to the reason that the ORIGIN of this issue lies in the Double Standards of Muslims and their one-sided practices, such as blasphemy laws and <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/blasphemy/islamophobia-vs-kafirophobia">Kafirophobia</a>. Thus, the rising Islamophobia is only a symptom, while the real disease lies in blasphemy laws and Kafirophobia. </p>
<p>It is also a request to the Western Left that they should realize that they will utterly fail to end hatred against Muslims in their western countries, without protesting and ending the unjust laws like blasphemy in the Islamic countries. The Western Left has not done justice with the issue of Blasphemy laws in Islamic countries and has not done enough to erase this problem. Blasphemy laws in Islamic countries should end, just like slavery ended in Islamic countries under the PRESSURE of the modern civilized world.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is a request to the Western Left to please make it their top priority to end the blasphemy laws in Muslim countries, so that people can freely criticize Islam, without fearing being killed in the name of blasphemy and apostasy.   </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Blasphemy is a basic human right?</h2>
<p>Please remember these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Where there is “Preaching”, there is also “Criticism”</b></li>
<li><b>Where there is “Praise”, there is also “Insult”</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Muslims consider Muhammad to be the best of mankind. Thus, they can highly “praise” Muhammad.</p>
<p>While non-Muslims believe Muhammad to be a false prophet, who killed thousands of people for his personal interests. Thus, non-Muslims are hurt and feel emotionally harmed when such a person is highly “praised” by Muslims.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the western secular system fully allows Muslims to praise Muhammad as much as they want, while non-Muslims cannot stop them from praising Muhammad, <b>and they have to bear this praise in the name of Freedom of Expression</b> and move on.</p>
<p>Similarly, even if Muslims claim they are hurt when someone insults Muhammad, still they cannot stop non-Muslims from orally insulting Muhammad. <b>They have to bear this insult </b>and move on.</p>
<p>Thus, praising Muhammad is a Right of Muslims, while insulting/blasphemy is the Right of non-Muslims. </p>
<p>Moreover, without the right of insult/blasphemy, nobody knows what makes Muslims accuse a non-Muslim of blasphemy and then kill him. </p>
<p>For example, when the Quran curses non-Muslims, resembling them with dogs and donkeys, call them filth and worst of animals and worst of creatures, or call them bastard, then it is neither insult nor blasphemy for Muslims. But just imagine if a non-Muslim curses Muhammad or resembles him with an animal in an Islamic country, then what would Muslims do with him? </p>
<p>Therefore, insulting/ridiculing are fundamental parts of discussions and debates, just like praising someone is a fundamental right. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A heavy majority of the Western people doesn't support the act of burning of the Quran (and correctly so). But still they support a law, which does not consider burning of the Quran as a crime.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>The answer is, while the Quran is already insulting them in the name of Kafir and calling them Filthy, Unclean, Fools, Dog, Donkey, Pigs, Worst of Creatures, Evildoers, Wicked, Transgressors, Ignorants, etc. </strong></p>
<p>But still the Western people bear this insult of the Quran and let it be published in their countries. And it happens only in the name of <strong>freedom of expression &amp; criticism &amp; ridicule &amp; insult.</strong> </p>
<p>Yes, all these are basic human rights (i.e. criticism &amp; ridicule &amp; even insult). Even though the majority of Western people don't like to indulge in ridicule and insult activities, and oppose it, still they consider it a basic human right. </p>
<p>Only due to these rights, Muslims first got the right to publish the Quran in Western countries, despite its cursing and insulting the local population of the Western countries. </p>
<p>Moreover, according to their law, the copies of the Quran are the private property of the protesters, and there is no crime involved if they burn their private property. It is not the same as setting fire to any mosque, which is not the private property of the protesters, but of Muslims. Thus, the law protects mosques from protesters. </p>
<h2><b>Western Law is fully in accordance with Human NATURE:</b></h2>
<p>It is normal according to human nature that people may become angry during discussions &amp; debates due to the difference of opinions. And they use harsh words in anger toward their opponents. Thus, western law is based exactly according to this human nature.</p>
<p>Even the writer of the Quran (which is Muhammad himself according to non-Muslims) showed this exact human nature. When the opponents didn't accept the prophethood of Muhammad, then the writer of the Quran became angry. And then he started <strong>cursing</strong> them at several places in Quran. And he started <strong>insulting</strong> them by equating them to the <em><strong>Donkey</strong></em>, <em><strong>Dogs</strong></em> and <em><strong>Pigs</strong></em>, the <em><strong>worst of animals</strong></em> and the <em><strong>worst of creatures</strong></em>, and for being <strong><em>filthy</em></strong>, and calling them names (like Abu Jahl) and “<em><strong>bastard</strong></em>” (Arabic: زنیم) and <em><strong>fools</strong></em> and deaf and <em><strong>blind</strong></em> and <em><strong>Kafir etc.</strong></em>.</p>
<p class="western">Muslims claim Allah has divine MORALS.</p>
<p class="western">Then the question is: “<em><strong>Why even the  “Divine Allah” is not able to control his anger, and he curses and abuses the opponents? How then can we expect a “normal human being” to have full control over his anger, and to show “better Morals” than even divine Allah?</strong></em>” </p>
<p>Moreover, this cursing and abuse of the opponents in the Quran is also PROOF that there exists no Allah in the heavens, and it was Muhammad himself, who was making the Quran on his own. And since Muhammad was only a human, thus he showed human errors in form of becoming angry and cursing and abusing his opponents.</p>
<p>That is why, Western law is totally perfect according to the Nature of human beings, and it cannot be changed for accommodating the blasphemy laws of Islam. The blasphemy laws of Islam have the problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are biased.</li>
<li>They are one-sided</li>
<li>They are against justice.</li>
<li>Furthermore, they go totally against human nature. </li>
<li>They are the precursors. Islamic states further use these blasphemy laws in order to kill ALL the CRITICISM against Islam. In Islamic countries, you cannot publish a single book or speech, which criticizes Islam, and they immediately blame it to be blasphemy, and then they kill the person. </li>
</ul>

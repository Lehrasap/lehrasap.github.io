			<title>Not a SINGLE Native Arabic Speaker (Pagan or Jew) converted to Islam due to the alleged Greatest Miracle of the Quran's Inimitability Challenge</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="first:mt-0 last:mb-0" dir="ltr">In that era, Arabic had a higher literary standard compared to today's language norms. Poetry was a primary form of hobby, entertainment and a widely practiced art. This wasn't exclusive to Arabic; many older languages had richer literary traditions than we see today.</p>
<p class="first:mt-0 last:mb-0" dir="ltr">As a result, while modern Arabic speakers might feel the Qur'anic Arabic as possessing some literary excellence, it held absolutely no literary excellence for the native Arabic-speaking pagans and Jews from the time of Muhammad. Consequently:</p>
<ul>
<li class="first:mt-0 last:mb-0" dir="ltr">Not even a SINGLE pagan or Jew converted to Islam based on the alleged literary excellence of the Qur'an.</li>
<li>And yes, almost ALL of these Pagans and Jews converted to Islam <span style="color: rgb(132, 63, 161);"><strong>LATER</strong></span>, but not due to Quran's Literary Excellence, but only due to the Fear of Sword.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Islamic preachers assert that the Quran stands as the<span style="color: #1200ff;"> <span style="color: #ff0000;">GREATEST Miracle of all time</span>, </span>either due to its purported inimitability or its proclaimed literary excellence<span style="color: #1200ff;">. </span>However, if this were indeed the case,<span style="color: #1200ff;"> </span>one would logically expect<span style="color: #1200ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> a significant number of conversions to Islam </span></span>as a result of this purported GREATEST Miracle<span style="color: #1200ff;">. </span>However, not a<span style="color: #1200ff;"> <span style="color: #ff0000;">SINGLE </span></span>native Arabic-speaking Pagan or Jew embraced Islam based on this acclaimed greatest miracle, although they were unmatched in their knowledge of classical Arabic.</strong></p>
<p>At most, Islamic preachers offer the names of only a few individuals who supposedly converted to Islam due to the inimitability miracle. For instance, they mention individuals like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Umar Ibn Khattab,</li>
<li><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab%C4%ABd">Labīd ibn Rabī al-ʿĀmirī</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufayl_ibn_Amr">Tufayl ibn Amr</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubayr_ibn_Mu%E1%B9%AD%CA%BDim">Jubayr ibn Mut'im</a></li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_ibn_al-Mughira">Walid ibn al-Mughira</a> (Actually, Walid didn't even accept Islam and he was a staunch opponent of Muhammad)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> Yet, even these individuals are not conclusively linked to accepting Islam because of the inimitability challenge (as we will see in this article later).</p>
<p>It was only Muhammad's true and most significant miracle, known as<span style="color: #1200ff;"> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">"The Sword Miracle,"</span></strong></span> that led the pagans to accept Islam en masse later in the 9th Hijri year. </p>
<h2>How did native Arabic-speaking Pagans understand this challenge (according to the witness of the Quan)?</h2>
<p>Islamic scholars of the last 14 centuries themselves failed to come to a consensus on what inimitability means regarding the Quran. It seems that the doctrine of the "Quranic Literary Miracle" was added to the "inimitability challenge" only in the fourth century. </p>
<p>But let us leave Islamic scholars and their claims. Let us concentrate on the Quran. </p>
<p>Firstly, it's crucial to understand that according to native Arabic-speaking Pagans/Jews, the Quranic Challenge specifically centers around the inimitability of the Quran and is unrelated to any literary miracle. These are two distinct concepts. It was only later generations of Muslims who associated the inimitability challenge of the Quran with a literary miracle. The Quran itself never claims to be a literary miracle, nor does any Hadith make such a claim.</p>
<p>Here are the verses of the Quran concerning this challenge, and you can see they all focus on inimitability, with none mentioning a literary miracle:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Or do they say he has <strong>fabricated </strong>it? Say bring then a chapter like unto it, and call upon whom you can besides God, if you speak truly!" (<a class="mw-redirect" title="Q10:38" href="https://quranx.com/10.38">10:38</a>) <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup></li>
<li>"Or do they say he has <strong>fabricated </strong>it? Nay! They believe not! Let them then produce a recital like unto it if they speak the truth." (<a class="mw-redirect" title="Q52:34" href="https://quranx.com/52.34">52:34</a>) <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"></sup></li>
<li>"And if you are in <strong>doubt </strong>concerning that which We have sent down to our servant, then produce a chapter of the like. But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the Kafirs." (<a class="mw-redirect" title="Q2:23" href="https://quranx.com/2.23">2:23</a>)</li>
<li>"Say, Bring you then ten chapters like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than God, if you speak the truth!" (<a class="mw-redirect" title="Q11:13" href="https://quranx.com/11.13">11:13</a>)</li>
<li>"If men and Jinn banded together to produce the like of this Qur'an they would never produce its like not though they backed one another." (<a class="mw-redirect" title="Q17:88" href="https://quranx.com/17.88">17:88</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Consequently:</p>
<ul>
<li>The native Arabic-speaking Meccans did not perceive the Quranic Challenge as a trial of the Quran's literary excellence.</li>
<li>Instead, they viewed it as a challenge related to the Quran's content and substance, rather than its style or linguistic prowess. They understood Muhammad's claim that his God communicated with him, revealing information about the unseen— past events, and tales of earlier nations. This claim mocked the pagans as their gods didn't communicate with them and didn't provide them with similar knowledge about past events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, regarding the inimitability challenge, the pagan Meccans were unimpressed, not considering it a miracle. Their response to the challenge is reflected in Quran 8:31:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="citation-1 citation-end-1">"When Our Signs are rehearsed to them, they say: '<strong>We have heard this (before): <span style="color: #ff0000;">if we wished, we could say (words) like these</span>: <span style="color: #0600ff;">these are nothing but tales of the ancients</span></strong>.'"</span> (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/8.31">8:31</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>They accused Muhammad of fabricating these tales with the assistance of others, as stated in Quran 25:4-5:</p>
<ul>
<li>"This [Quran] is not except a falsehood he fabricated, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>and another people assisted him in it</strong></span>. And they say: '(These are the) <span style="color: #0600ff;"><strong>Tales of the ancients, which he has written down</strong></span>.'" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/25.4?context=2">25:4-5</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as the additional literary miracle is concerned, then the Quran is itself proof that the Native Arabic-speaking pagans were aware of the somewhat poetic nature of the Quran. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/21/5/default.htm">6:5</a>:</p>
<p>بَلْ قَالُوٓا۟ أَضْغَٰثُ أَحْلَٰمٍۭ بَلِ ٱفْتَرَىٰهُ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>بَلْ هُوَ شَاعِرٌ</strong></span> </p>
<p>Yet they say: "These (i.e. the Quranic verses) are only confused dreams (of Muhammad), or he has invented them; or <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>he is only a poet</strong></span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There existed tons of poets in that era, whose poetry was considered great, despite them being illiterates (just like Muhammad). Therefore, the fact of Muhammad's illiteracy would in no way constitute proof of the Qur'an miraculous origin as the great pre-Islamic poets were illiterate.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the mindset of the people of pre-Islamic Arabia. Eloquence and poetry were the essence of their society. The natural taste for Arabic poetry and literature was ingrained in every child. Eloquence and rhetoric flowed through their veins like lifeblood. They possessed a lot of pride in their poetry and literature. They were so proud of poetry that they used to call all other nations "Ajam," meaning "dumb", in comparison to themselves.</p>
<p>So, they were the best people to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>JUDGE</strong></span> if there existed any literary miracle in the Quran or not. And according to their judgment, the Quran had absolutely no miracle. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>During the era of Muhammad, poetry in Arab culture stood at notably higher standards compared to contemporary Arabic literature. Hence, modern-day Arabs might perceive it as having some literary impact. However, this phenomenon isn't unique to Arabic; many languages had higher literary standards in the past. Take, for instance, the Hindu religious text Ramayana, an epic poem comprising over 24,000 couplet verses divided into seven kāṇḍas. The Hindus of TODAY also claim their Ramayana to be a literary miracle as its literary standard is very high for present-day people. </p>
<p>Consequently, for the people of Muhammad's era, the Quran did not represent a literary miracle.</p>

<h2>Muhammad was not a poet, but he was fluent and very eloquent in Arabic:</h2>
<p>In his sira book, <a href="https://archive.org/details/NobleLifeOfTheProphetMuhammadSAWDr.AliMuhammadSallabi"><em>Noble Life of the Prophet (page 84)</em></a>, Al-Sallabi talks about how the city-dwellers of Makkah would send their kids to the desert, where one of the benefits was to be raised with proper Arabic grammar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was common during those times for women who lived in the city to give up their infants for a while to women who lived in the desert. Those women were wetnurses; they would rear and breastfeed the infants for a number of months or years, depending on the child. The theory behind this practice was that children who were raised in the desert were at a safe distance from the diseases that commonly afflicted city-dwelling people; furthermore, in the desert, a child would grow up independent and strong, both physically and mentally; <strong>and he would learn pure, grammatically correct Arabic, and avoid picking up the slang that was often spoken in the city</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ali al-Sallabi then mentions a conversation where Abu Bakr asks Muhammad about his eloquence, and Muhammad's response to the question (<a href="https://archive.org/details/NobleLifeOfTheProphetMuhammadSAWDr.AliMuhammadSallabi">page 89</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the desert land of the Banu Sa'd tribe, the Prophet learned fluent, pure Arabic; later on in his life, he became the most eloquent speaker of the language. Once, Abu Bakr &amp; said to him, "O Messenger of Allah, I have not seen anyone who is more eloquent than you are." The Prophet replied, "And what would prevent me (from being so), for I am from the Quraish, and I was nursed (and raised) among (the) Banu Sa'd (tribe)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Martin Lings' sira, <em>Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources</em>, it is mentioned (<a href="https://ia802807.us.archive.org/18/items/muhammad_martin_Lings/muhammad_martin_Lings.pdf">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Muhammad had never shown any inclination to compose a poem, though he was unsurpassed in his mastery of Arabic, and in the beauty of his speech. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the above quote, it appears in the book's introduction, where Lings discusses Prophet Muhammad's eloquence and his lack of inclination toward composing poetry, despite his mastery of the Arabic language. For a comprehensive understanding of Prophet Muhammad's life based on early sources, Martin Lings' biography is highly regarded and widely available.</p>
<h2>Failure of Islamic preachers to show where a large number of native Pagans/Jews converted to Islam due to this alleged Greatest Miracle of all time</h2>
<p>If the Quran truly stands as the greatest miracle of all time, it would be reasonable to expect a substantial number of conversions to Islam because of it. However, Islamic preachers have not provided evidence of such widespread conversions attributable to the Quran's inimitability challenge.</p>
<p>At most, Islamic preachers offer the names of only a few individuals who supposedly converted to Islam due to the inimitability miracle. For instance, they mention a few individuals like Umar Ibn Khattab, <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab%C4%ABd">Labīd ibn Rabī al-ʿĀmirī</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufayl_ibn_Amr">Tufayl ibn Amr</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubayr_ibn_Mu%E1%B9%AD%CA%BDim">Jubayr ibn Mut'im</a>. Yet, even these individuals are not conclusively linked to accepting Islam because of the inimitability challenge. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Biggest Problem: Muslims <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">FABRICATED</span> thousands of false traditions for the sake of their religion:</strong></span></p>
<p>The most significant issue is the fabrication of thousands of false traditions by later Muslim generations to bolster their religion. These fabrications cast doubt on the authenticity of traditions related to these individuals. </p>
<p>To understand this issue of the fabrication of traditions by Muslims to bolster their religion, please read our articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/component/content/article/131-ahadith-claim-ishaaq-was-sacrificed-vs-133-ahadith-claim-ismael-was-sacrificed?catid=23">The Hadith Fabrication Factory of Muslims: 131 Traditions claimed it was Ishaaq who was slaughtered, while 133 Traditions were fabricated that claimed it was Ismael who was slaughtered</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/the-unreliability-of-hadith-and-ilm-ul-hadith/the-lie-of-moon-splitting-ample-proof-that-hadiths-cannot-be-trusted">The Lie of Moon Splitting: Ample Proof that Hadiths Cannot Be Trusted</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, please keep in mind that later Muslim generations were fully capable of fabricating dozens of false traditions about these few individuals too. </p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(1) Umar Ibn Khattab:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Islamic preachers assert that Umar, upon hearing the verses of the Quran in his sister's home, was deeply moved, leading to his acceptance of Islam. However, this claim faces several challenges. For example, t<span style="font-size: 1rem;">he hadith recounting Umar's experience in his sister's home is not considered Sahih (authentic) according to the standards of Hadith in Islam. Moreover, c</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">ontradictory traditions exist regarding the circumstances of Umar's conversion, undermining the reliability of the story involving his sister's home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Furthermore, even within the narrative of his sister's home, there is no mention of a specific challenge related to the inimitability or linguistic miracle of the Quran. Instead, it suggests that Umar was moved by the Quranic message of monotheism. </span>Yes, the Quranic message might have touched the hearts of some pagans. Perhaps they would have found it more attractive than the pagan religion which had multiple gods and questionable rituals. </p>
<p>However, <span style="color: #e67e23;"><em>finding the Quranic message more attractive than the pagan religion is not equal to converting to Islam due to the Quranic challenge of inimitability or its alleged literary miracle</em></span>. </p>

<p>Again there exist no reliable traditions about him. And those traditions, which exist, tell contradictory stories about how he accepted Islam.</p>
<p><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab%C4%ABd">One tradition</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> claims Muhammad hanged 3 verses of "Sura al-Kawthar" on Ka'ba. When </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Labīd</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> saw those 3 verses of Surah al-Kawthat, he claimed it to be only a divine speech and accepted Islam. However, it seems logically not possible that the pagans of Mecca would have ever allowed Muhammad to put the verses of the Quan on Ka'ba. </span></p>

<h3>(3) Tufayl ibn Amr:</h3>
<p><span class="mw-page-title-main">The story of Tufayl Ibn Amr is as under. Ibn Hisham wrote (<a href="https://asimiqbal2nd.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/seerah-ibnhisham.pdf">English Translation, page 154</a>):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="mw-page-title-main">... I (i.e. Tufayl) said. The apostle explained Islam to me and recited the Quran to me. By Allah I never heard anyting finer nor anything more just. So I became a Muslim and bore true witness. I said, `O prophet of God, I am a man of authority among my people and when I go back and call them to Islam, pray to Allah to give me a (miracle as a) sign which will help me when I preach to them.' He said, `O Allah give him (a miracle as) a sign.'  So I went back to my people and when I came to the pass which would bring me down to the settlement a <strong>light like a lamp played between my eyes</strong> and <strong>I said, `O God, not in my face!</strong> for I fear that they will think that a dire punishment has befallen my face because I have left their religion.' <strong>So the light moved and lighted on the top of my whip</strong>. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, this story is not narrated in accordance with the authentic (Sahih) standards as per Muslims' own criteria. Secondly, the portrayal of light appearing between Tufayl's eyes as a miracle leans more towards a fantasy narrative rather than reality. Please read our following article to see how the Quran itself become a witness that all claims about miracles by Muhammad/Allah were false:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/why-test/allah-failed-to-pass-his-own-test-of-showing-a-miracle">Allah's FAILURE to pass his own TEST of showing a Miracle </a></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, does this not suggest a lapse in Allah's omniscience, given that he apparently did not foresee that Tufayl's people would interpret it as a severe punishment for abandoning the religion of their ancestors rather than embracing Islam because of this miracle? How did Tufayl surpass Allah in wisdom?</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span class="mw-page-title-main">(4): Jubayr ibn Mut'im:</span></strong></span></h3>
<p>Islamic <a href="https://dawatnews.net/%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%EF%B7%BA-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%AC%D8%B2%DB%81-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%93%D9%86/">preachers</a> also claim that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubayr_ibn_Mu%E1%B9%AD%CA%BDim">Jubayr ibn Mut'im</a> was arrested and taken to the Prophetic mosque. There, when he heard the verse <em>[Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators of themselves? (Verse <a href="https://quranx.com/52.35">52:35</a>)]</em>, then he was impressed and he accepted Islam. </p>
<p>In response, we assert that his conversion cannot be solely attributed to the Quran being a literary miracle. While it's true that the Quran's message may resonate with certain individuals, such experiences are common across various religions and ideologies. Additionally, <a href="https://alsharia.org/2014/aug/aejaz-e-quran-jaiza-muhammad-hasnain">another tradition</a> presents a different narrative, suggesting that he embraced Islam due to verse <a href="https://quranx.com/52.7">52:7</a> (which concerns Allah's torment rather than creation).</p>

<p>Islamic preachers often cite the case of Walid ibn al-Mughira to bolster the claim of the Quran's literary miracle. However, he did not even embrace Islam because of this alleged miracle. In fact, he was one of Muhammad's staunchest opponents. So much so that Muhammad denounced him harshly in the Quran (<a href="https://quranx.com/68.13?context=5">68:10-13</a>), labeling him as "<em><span style="color: #1200ff;">a worthless habitual sweater, a slanderer, a preventer of good, a transgressor, a sinner, and a</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bastard زنيم</span></em>".</p>
<p>Why did Muhammad use such strong language for him in the Quran?</p>
<p>The reason lies in Walid's remarks about the Quran. He referred to it as "the tales of ancient people أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلْأَوَّلِينَ" (Quran <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://quranx.com/68.13">68:15</a>) and dismissed it as "magic" and "the speech of only a human being" (Quran <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://quranx.com/74.24?context=2">74:24-25</a>).</p>

<p>Muhammad's purpose in revealing these verses was to refute Walid's judgment about the Quran and to warn of severe punishment for him in the afterlife. However, Muhammad, being human, made a significant error here, as these verses also serve as evidence that Walid did indeed "reflect" and then "evaluate" the Quran as merely magic and the speech of a human being.</p>
<p>Thus, these verses contradict Muhammad and the Quran, indicating that native Arabic speakers did indeed perceive the Quran as nothing more than magic and human speech.</p>
<p>To counter these explicit Quranic verses, Muslims fabricated the following tradition, alleging that Walid did not contemplate to evaluate the Quran, but he only reflected to plot a scheme against the Quran.</p>

<p>... from<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong>Ibn Abbas</strong></span>, may Allah be pleased with them both, that Al-Walid ibn Al-Mughirah <strong>came to the Prophet</strong>, peace be upon him, <strong>and he recited the Quran to Walid</strong>. It was as if al-Mughirah was enchanted by it. This news reached Abu Jahl, so he went to him and said, "O uncle, your people are thinking of gathering wealth for you." The Prophet asked, "Why?" Abu Jahl replied, "To give it to you, so that you leave the path of Muhammad and stay on the religion that you followed previously." Walid replied, "Quraysh know that I am among its wealthiest." Abu Jahl said, "Then say something about Muhammad that would reach your people that you reject him or that you dislike him." Walid replied, "What should I say? By Allah,<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> there is no man among you who knows more about poetry than me</span></strong>, nor do anyone knows more about rhymes, or the<strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">poetry of the jinn</span></strong> than me. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>By Allah, his speech does not resemble anything. By Allah, what he says has a sweetness to it, and upon it, there is a beauty. It is fruitful, its highest part is overflowing, and its lowest part is deep. It rises above, and nothing rises above it. It breaks down whatever is beneath it.</em></span>" Abu Jahl said, "Your people will not be satisfied with you until you say something about him." Al-Mughirah said, "Leave me until I <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>think</strong></span>." When he <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>pondered</strong></span>, he said, "This is magic that influences but cannot be influenced by others."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the problem persists: Islamic traditions are highly unreliable, with hundreds of thousands of such traditions fabricated for the sake of religion. For instance, in this tradition, we encounter the perplexing notion of "<strong>knowing the poetry of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jinns</span></strong>." How did Walid come to possess this knowledge? Was he in communication with Jinns?</p>
<p>Moreover, why was Walid singled out as the only one able to discern that the Quran was not of human origin? What about other native Arabic-speaking pagans, who boasted numerous skilled poets? Why were they unable to recognize the literary brilliance of the Quran? Does this imply that one must be among the top poets, and know both human and Jinn poetry to recognize the Quranic literary excellence?</p>
<p>Furthermore, contradictions often arise in such cases, where falsehoods are spoken. This inconsistency is evident in another tradition narrated by the same Ibn Abbas, which also contains contradictions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=74&amp;tAyahNo=11&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=2&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">Tafsir Ibn Kathir, verse 74:11</a>:</p>
<p>عن ابن عباس قال دخل الوليد بن المغيرة على أبي بكر بن أبي قحافة، فسأله عن القرآن، فلما أخبره، خرج على قريش فقال يا عجباً لما يقول ابن أبي كبشة فوالله ما هو بشعر ولا بسحر، ولا بهذي من الجنون، وإن قوله لمن كلام الله، فلما سمع بذلك النفر من قريش، ائتمروا وقالوا والله لئن صبأ الوليد، لتصبو قريش، فلما سمع بذلك أبو جهل بن هشام قال أنا والله أكفيكم شأنه، فانطلق حتى دخل عليه بيته، فقال للوليد ألم تر إلى قومك قد جمعوا لك الصدقة؟ فقال ألست أكثرهم مالاً وولداً؟ فقال أبو جهل يتحدثون أنك إنما تدخل على ابن أبي قحافة لتصيب من طعامه، فقال الوليد أقد تحدث به عشيرتي؟ فلا والله لا أقرب ابن أبي قحافة ولاعمر ولا ابن أبي كبشة، وما قوله إلا سحر يؤثر</p>
<p> He (Ibn `Abbas) said, "Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the <strong>house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an</strong>. When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. <em><strong>I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah</span></strong></em>!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>charity</strong></span> for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his <strong>food</strong>.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the contradictions become apparent:</p>
<p>The first tradition asserts that Walid visited Muhammad, who recited the Quran to him. However, the second tradition contends that Walid visited Abu Bakr's house, where Abu Bakr recited the Quran to him.</p>
<p>In the first tradition, Abu Jahl didn't orchestrate any plot; instead, he simply informed Walid that the Qurayshi people were amassing funds to "<strong>BUY his loyalty</strong>", dissuading him from following Muhammad and remaining steadfast in his ancestral religion. Conversely, the second tradition alleges that Abu Jahl indeed plotted, informing Walid that the Qurayshi people were gathering funds as "<strong>CHARITY</strong>" for him, while he visited Abu Bakr's home under the pretense of seeking "food." Abu Jahl hoped to provoke Walid's anger with this plot and thereby ensnare him in his scheme.</p>
<p>Is it plausible to believe that a discerning individual like Walid would so easily succumb to Abu Jahl's ploy, especially when he supposedly knew well that Muhammad's speech was neither poetry nor magic but indeed the words of Allah, a fact he allegedly openly testified to before Quraysh?</p>
<p>The contradictions persist. Yet, a third tradition posits that it wasn't due to Abu Jahl, but rather Walid independently devised this scheme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=74&amp;tAyahNo=11&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=2&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">Tafsir Ibn Kathir, verse 74:11</a>:</p>
<p>وقد زعم السدي أنهم لما اجتمعوا في دار الندوة ليجمعوا رأيهم على قول يقولونه فيه قبل أن يقدم عليهم وفود العرب للحج ليصدوهم عنه، فقال قائلون شاعر، وقال آخرون ساحر، وقال آخرون كاهن، وقال آخرون مجنون كما ... كل هذا والوليد يفكر فيما يقوله فيه، ففكر وقدر، ونظر وعبس وبسر، فقال إنْ هذا إلا سحر يؤثر، إنْ هذا إلا قول البشر</p>
<p>Al-Suddi claimed that when they gathered in Dar al-Nadwah to agree on a statement to say about him before the Arab delegations arrived for Hajj to dissuade them from following him, some said he was a poet, others said he was a magician, others said he was a soothsayer, and others said he was insane ...  All of this while Al-Walid was contemplating what to say about him. So he pondered, estimated, looked, frowned, and scowled, and he said, "This is nothing but magic that has an influence. This is nothing but human speech."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quranic verses themselves provide clarity that Walid did not scheme/plot anything. These verses contain no indication of Walid recognizing the speech as Allah's, Abu Jahl's plot, or any planning by Walid.</p>
<p>Surah 74 was revealed early in Muhammad's proclamation of prophethood in Mecca. Throughout his 13-year Meccan life, Walid persistently opposed Muhammad, yet neither Muhammad nor any of his Muslim companions reminded him of the events mentioned in these traditions (i.e., why Walid opposed Muhammad despite allegedly acknowledging the Quran's excellence and divine origin).</p>
<p>The Quran consistently denounces Walid as "<em>a worthless habitual sweater, a slanderer, a preventer of good, a transgressor, a sinner, and a Bastard زنيم,</em>" among other things, but never once reminds him that he had previously acknowledged the Quran as Allah's speech and a miracle.</p>

<p>The term "قَدَّرَ" means "to evaluate/to deliberate/to measure/to determine." It belongs to the "Verb (form II)" category. <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=74&amp;verse=15">Link</a>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the modern Quranic translators have altered the meaning of "قَدَّرَ" to "to plot/to plan/to make a scheme." (<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/74/18/">link</a>).</p>
<p>However, they are caught red-handed, as "قَدَّرَ" has been used in numerous other Quranic verses, consistently conveying the meaning of "to evaluate/to determine" and never as "to plot/to plan". (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=qdr#(74:18:3)">link</a>). Moreover, even many of modern Quran translators translated it correctly as "to evaluate/to deliberate/to measure/to determine." (<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/74/18/">link</a>)</p>

<h2>Some people even believed in Musaylimah's false prophethood after hearing his Quran</h2>
<p>Even if we assume any individual became a Muslim while he found the Quran beautiful, it is still not proof as many people were also became impressed from Musaylimah after listening his Quran and they believed in him. </p>
<p>In <strong>Volume 10</strong> of al-Tabari's "History of the Prophets and Kings," specifically in the section covering the Ridda Wars, al-Tabari recounts the story of Musaylimah and his following. Here is a relevant passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Musaylimah ibn Habib, known as Musaylimah the Liar, claimed prophethood and was followed by the Banu Hanifa tribe. He composed verses that he presented as divine revelation, which some people of his tribe accepted and believed in. His influence grew, and many adhered to his message, leading to conflicts with the followers of Muhammad." </p>

<h2>Why did Muhammad have to UPGRADE the Quran's Inimitability Challenge?</h2>
<p>Why do you think the QURAN CHALLENGE went on upgrading from one verse to the whole Quran?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 1: Produce <strong>one verse</strong> like this</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surah At-Tur 52 verse 33-34: Or do they say, “He has made it up”? Rather, they do not believe. Then let them produce a statement like it, if they should be truthful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 2: Produce <strong>a whole chapter</strong> like this</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surah Al-Baqarah 2 verse 23: And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant, then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.</p>
<p>Surah Yunus 10 verse 38: Or do they say, “He invented it?” Say, “Then bring forth a surah like it and call upon whomever you can besides Allah, if you should be truthful.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 3: Produce <strong>ten chapters</strong> like this </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surah Hud 11 verse 13: Or do they say, “He invented it”? Say, “Then bring ten surahs like it that have been invented and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides Allah, if you should be truthful.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 4: Produce <strong>a complete Qur'an</strong> like this </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surah Al-Isra 17 verse 88: Say, “If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Qur’an, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Fact: People Embraced Islam because of the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sword Miracle</span>" of Islam, and not because of the  "Inimitability" (i.e. the alleged greatest miracle of all time)</h2>
<p>These are the factors influencing why Arabic-speaking pagans embraced Islam:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lower-status individuals with immature opinions.</li>
<li>Dissatisfaction with the pagan religion.</li>
<li>Power dynamics and politics.</li>
<li>Coercion through Sword: Particularly evident during the later years of Muhammad's life when he wielded absolute power in the entire Arabian peninsula, and he issued threats of violence against all pagans in the Quran (9:5). This fear of sword was a primary catalyst for the spread of Islam.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>(1) Lower-status People with immature opinions</strong></h3>
<p>According to the pagan Quraysh, only a small number of lower-status individuals believed in Muhammad's message due to their immaturity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/11/27/default.htm">11.27</a>: The chiefs of the disbelieving nation said, "We find you to be no more than a human like us, and we find that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only those of lower status and immature opinion follow you</span>. We do not find you superior to us in any way. In fact, we think you are a liar!".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the number of such people was very limited, and many of them were slaves.</p>
<h3><strong>(2) Dissatisfaction with the Pagan Religion</strong></h3>
<p>Pagan religions often involved strange rituals that seemed nonsensical to many. In contrast, Muhammad's message of monotheism, focusing on one single god, was appealing to certain individuals. According to Muslim accounts, some pagans had already abandoned their faith to become Christians or followers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif">Hanif</a> religion. However, their numbers remained relatively small.</p>
<h3><strong>(3) Power dynamics and politics</strong></h3>
<p>Throughout the entire Meccan period spanning 13 years, only a handful of people embraced Islam. Surprisingly, in Medina, a significant number of people converted to Islam even in Muhammad's absence. How did this happen?</p>
<p>The answer lies in power dynamics and politics.</p>
<p>Medina was home to two major pagan Arab tribes, Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj, alongside three major Jewish tribes and several smaller ones.</p>
<p>The pagan Arabs, feeling inferior to the Jews due to their superior education, wealth, and fertile lands, gradually began to convert to Judaism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2682">Sunan Abi Dawud, 2682</a>:</p>
<p>When the children of a woman (in pre-Islamic days) did not survive, she took a vow on herself that if her child survives, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">she would convert it a Jew</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the pagan Arabs were also afraid of the Jews, as they used to hear from their Jewish neighbours that a prophet would be sent at the end of time and that the Jews would follow him and fight the Arabs along with him and kill them in the same manner in which the earlier nations of ‘Ad and Iram were killed and destroyed.</p>
<p>A huge civil war took place in Medina, where al-Aws and al-Khazraj fought each other too. And when al-Aws lost a lot of wars against al-Khazraj, they went to seek the alliance of pagan Meccans, but they refused (Samhudi, Wafaa al-Wafaa, Vol. 1, p. 385). At that time Muhammad presented himself to them, seeking protection in Medina and telling them that he and his followers would then assist them. Some of them accepted Islam at that time. </p>
<p>This was soon followed by the war of Bu'ath (another civil war in Medinah). It took place 5 years before hijra (i.e. Muhammad's migration to Medina). </p>
<p>*Aisha described this war:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3846">3846</a>:</p>
<p>"Allah caused the day of Bu'ath to take place before Allah's Messenger (saw) was sent so that when he reached Medina, those people had already divided (in different groups) and their chiefs had been killed or wounded. So, Allah made that day precede Allah's Messenger (saw) so that they (i.e. the two pagan Arab tribes) might embrace Islam." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of their key leaders (those who had a similar mentality to ibn Ubbay) who could hinder the message of Muhammad were killed as well as large numbers of their followers. Thus, the new generation of two pagan Arab tribes wanted to unite again and utilised the offer of Muhammad. (Samhudi, Wafaa al-Wafaa, Vol. 1, p. 389, Shireef, Tarikh Makah wa al-Madinah, p. 367)</p>
<p>The promise of the Jews to kill and destroy the polytheistic Arabs on the arrival of their next prophet also made al-Aws and al-Khazraj to accept Islam. As al-Aws and al-Khazraj collectively could exert control over the Jews, they received Muhammad and were able to launch the Islamic state.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In Zad Al-Ma‘ad, Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/115459/reasons-why-al-aws-and-al-khazraj-tribes-embraced-islam#:~:text=It%20was%20one%20of%20the,would%20follow%20him%20and%20fight">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things which Allah Almighty accomplished for His Messenger, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was that the tribes of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj heard from their allies from among the Jews of Al-Madeenah, that 'A Prophet will appear in our time and we will follow him and kill you, in the same manner in which ‘Ad and Iram were killed.' The Ansar used to perform Hajj, as did the Arabs, but not the Jews. So when they saw the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, inviting people to Allah during the season of Hajj and they observed his manners, some of them said to the others, "<em>You know, by Allah, O people, that this is the prophet whom you were threatened with by the Jews, so do not let them precede you in following him. So hasten to accept his invitation.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>(4) Not even 10 Jews believed in Muhammad due to the alleged greatest miracle of inimitability:</h3>
<p>After arriving in Medina, initially, Muhammad tried to please the Jews so that they accepted him as a true prophet. For this purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad started to copy a lot of Jewish Laws into Islamic Sharia. </li>
<li>He also claimed the revelation of such verses, that were pleasing the Jews, like verse <a href="https://quranx.com/29.46">29:46</a> {<em>Our God and your God is one, and to Him we submit</em>}.</li>
<li>He also changed the Qibla from Ka'ba to the Jewish Temple (Bait-ul-Muqqadas) in Jerusalem. </li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, the Jews of Medina didn't believe in Islam and kept declaring Muhammad to be a false prophet. </p>
<p>The alleged inimitability and literary miracles of the Quran neither ever impressed the Pagans in Mecca, nor it ever impressed the Jews in Medina. </p>
<p>This frustrated Muhammad so much, that he used to say even if 10 Jews believed in him, then all Jews would become Muslims. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Note:</strong> The Islamic Translators of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim added these words in parenthesis on their own "<span style="background-color: #fcff01;"><em><strong>(amongst their chiefs)"</strong></em></span></span> or "<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;"><em><strong>Scholars of the Jews"</strong></em></span></span> It is a Distortion (TEHRIF) case, while these words have nothing to do with the original tradition, which is talking about normal 10 Jews, and not about any of their chiefs/scholars.

<p>This distortion by Islamic preachers is utterly shameful and shows how dishonest they are and how ashamed they are of the truth.</p>
<p>It seems Muhammad repeated this statement multiple times, and his companion 'Auf ibn Malik is also a witness to a similar statement from him. </p>

<p>But the Jews of Medina still refused to accept him as a true prophet, and that was the point where Muhammad's enmity and hatred started against the Jews:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, Muhammad changed the Qibla once again from Bait-ul-Muqqadas to Ka'ba in Mecca. </li>
<li>Then he started openly threatening the Jews to accept Islam, otherwise, they would be expelled from Medina, and he would snatch away all of their lands by force. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3167">Sahih Bukhari, 3167</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">While we were in the Mosque, the Prophet (ﷺ) came out and said, "Let us go to the Jews" We went out till we reached Bait-ul-Midras.

<p>Yes, that was the whole argument of Muhammad: "...<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong><span style="color: #e67e23;">that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle (only)</span></strong></span></span> ..."</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Please remember that Muhammad used the same argument to attack innocent Pagan tribes (who had nothing to do with Muhammad previously and had never attacked or harmed Muhammad). </span></p>

The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." Prophet said: <span style="color: #e67e23;"><em><strong>All the graze-lands belong to Allah and his prophet.</strong></em></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Later Muhammad's anger and hatred against the Jews went so high that he was no more satisfied by expelling them from Medina, but he wanted to expel them from the whole Arab peninsula. It was due to the reason that it was a shame for him that he was claiming himself to be the promised prophet of the Jews, but the Jews were telling people that he was not that promised prophet. Muhammad didn't want the Jews to tell this to others, thus he wanted to expel them from the whole Arabian peninsula. </p>

</div>
<h3>(5) Pagans didn't accept Islam even after the Victory of Mecca:</h3>
<p>Despite the conquest of Mecca by Muhammad in the 7th year of Hijri, the pagan Meccans remained resistant to accepting Islam.</p>
<p>In an effort to prevent opposition from the pagan leaders of Mecca, Muhammad offered stipends to them, fostering a sense of financial interest and aiming to ensure their compliance with Islam. Quran (<a href="https://quranx.com/9.60">9:60</a>). But despite getting the stipends, they didn't accept Islam. </p>
<h3>(6) Pagans accepted Islam only after they were FORCED to do it under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fear of Sword</span></h3>
<p>So, the situation was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native Arabic-speaking Pagans of Mecca were not accepting Islam due to its challenge of inimitability or any linguistic miracle.</li>
<li>They didn't accept it after the conquer of Mecca in 7th Hijri year. </li>
<li>They didn't accept it even after receiving stipends. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the 9th Hijri year, Muhammad claimed the revelation of verse <a href="https://quranx.com/9.5">9:5</a> (i.e. the Verse of the Sword, which ordered to kill all polytheists after 4 months). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/9.5">9:5</a>:</p>
<p>And when the sacred months have passed, then <span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong>kill the polytheists wherever you find them</strong></span> and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent,<strong><em> </em></strong>establish<strong><em> prayer, </em></strong>and give<strong><em> zakah</em></strong> (<em>i.e. if they become Muslims</em>), let them [go] on their way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad allowed the people of the book (i.e. Christians/Jews/Magians) to stay alive by paying Jizya tax, but he refused to accept any Jizya from polytheists. They either had to accept Islam, or they would be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Only after that, pagan Arabs accepted Islam to save their lives. </p>
<p>The Christians/Jews/Magians paid Jizya but didn't accept Islam. It was difficult for Muhammad to kill Christians and Jews as killing them for not accepting Islam would have angered the Christian Byzantine Empire while killing Magians would have angered the Magian Persian Empire. But pagan Arabs were vulnerable and they had no backing outside of Arabia. Therefore, Muhammad allowed them to stay alive by paying Jizya. </p>
<p>Due to this forced conversion, we do see Christians and Jews in Arab countries, but no polytheists as all of them were forced to convert to Islam. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<h3>The Ridiculous Level of Incoherence in the Quran</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can this Quran be a miracle, when it is so incoherent that thousands of the top commentators of the Quran of the last 14 centuries are trying to understand it, but are still unable to do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the verses which were revealed during the Meccan period are present in the Medinan Surahs and vice versa, making it impossible for a normal person to understand which verse is talking about which incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This disorder is not limited to the Surahs (Chapter), but this disease goes beyond this issue. For example, even in a single verse, the first part talks about one event, but the second part starts talking about another event which took place years apart, and then the 3rd part of the same verse starts talking again about the 1st event again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at this verse from the Quran:</span></p>

And this part has nothing to do with the previous part of the verse. </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there any book other than the Quran which could be so much Incoherent?</span></p>
<p>For sure, even the Bible is also incoherent in many places, but still, it is tens of times better in incoherence than the Quran and even a normal person can understand it while reading it. But this thing is not possible with the Quran, and a normal person is absolutely not able to understand it, despite the big claims of Muslims and the Quran itself that Allah made the Quran easy to understand for the people. </p>
<p><span style="color: #ba372a; background-color: #eccafa;"><em>Actually, the biggest miracle is how billions of Muslims could consider such an incoherent book like the Quran to be a miracle. </em></span></p>

<h3>Linguistic Mistake in the Quran, Indicating Its Human Origins</h3>
<p>Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/11/default.htm">4:11</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِىٓ أَوْلَٰدِكُمْ ۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ ۚ فَإِن كُنَّ <span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong>نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ</strong></span> فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ ۖ وَإِن كَانَتْ وَٰحِدَةً فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصْفُ ۚ </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Allah is incorrectly using the phrase “<strong>more than two daughters</strong>” when He actually wanted to say “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”.</p>
<p>Please read the detailed article <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/divine-revelation-or-a-human-drama/quran-s-mathematical-mistakes-in-the-inheritance-laws">here.</a></p>
<p>It is a clear linguistic mistake, and it happened while no Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own, and he was not safe from making human mistakes like these. </p>
<p>All Muslim Scholars agree that two daughters will get 2/3 of the estate.</p>
<p>Muhammad himself distributed 2/3rd of the estate between two daughters. </p>
<p>Sunan Tirmidhi, 2092:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The wife of Sa’d bin Rabi’ came with the two daughters of Sa’d to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, these are the two daughters of Sa’d. He was killed with you on the day of Uhud, and their paternal uncle has taken all that their father left behind, and a woman is only married for her wealth.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent until the Verse of inheritance was revealed to him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the brother of Sa’d bin Rabi’ and said: ‘Give the two daughters of Sa’d two thirds of his wealth, and give his wife on eighth, and take what is left.’”</p>

<h4>Tehrif (Distortion) Case:</h4>
<p>It was such a big error, that modern Muslims Quran Translators have to make a TEHRIF (Distortion) in its translation, and change it to “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”. For example, look at the translation of Yousuf Ali. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Quran 4:11</a>) Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, <span style="color: #236fa1; background-color: #eccafa;"><strong>two or more</strong></span>, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. (<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Yusuf Ali, Saudi Revised Edition,1985</a>)</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that modern Muslim apologists have made dishonesty HALAL for themselves. They distort, they hide, they tell clear lies ... but the truth will still become evident. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The negligence of the Quran resulted in the "suffering" of millions </h3>
<p>Let us look at an example of slave women. There are only those Quranic verses present in the Quran, which tell that having sex with them is Halal (permissible). But there is not a single verse present in the Quran about the "human rights" of slave women.</p>
<p>It resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past 1400 years, millions of slave women were forced to roam in public without the Hijab and with naked chests. All 4 Sunni Imams (actually all early (i.e. Salaf) Muslims of the first 450 years agreed upon it, while there is no verse in the Quran which denies it. </li>
<li>And all millions of captive/slave women were "raped" by Muslim men in a "Temporary" sexual relationship (like Shia Mut'ah). An owner fulfilled his lust by raping the slave girl, and then after getting bored with her, he sold her in the Islamic Bazaar of slavery. And then he bought himself a new slave girl and started raping her. Poor slave girls were sold multiple times, and they were multiple times raped by multiple different men. All this happened while there is not a single verse present in the Quran about the rights of slave women. </li>
<li>The children of slave parents were also born automatically as slaves due to the evil of "Slavery by Birth" in Islam. When the babies got two molar teeth (at about the age of 6 months), they were separated from their slave mothers and were sold in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery. </li>
<li>If a Muslim owner got a lust for the wife of his male slave, then he simply took her for himself, raped her, and after fulfilling his lust, sent him back to her husband (i.e. his male slave). This was practised by all Muslims during their 1300-year-long history of Islamic slavery. </li>
</ul>
<p>For details and proof, please read our article: <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity">The Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity</a></p>
<p>The Quran is a huge voluminous book, but it is filled with only old fantasy tales and lofty claims about the greatness of Allah. Meanwhile, it has neglected the rights and well-being of humanity. Only a single verse was enough to free millions of slave women from the evil of being raped. Only a single verse was enough that the 6-month-old babies were not separated from their mothers and sold in the Bazaars of Slavery ...</p>
<p>How can then such a book be called a miracle? </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Mathematical Mistake in the Quran</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>(1) When SHARES make less than the Estate (An <a href="https://islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/133406/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AB">'Asbah عصبة</a> Case)</strong></span></span></p>
<p>For instance, let's consider a scenario where an individual passes away, leaving behind one daughter, parents, and wife. In such a case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The share of the daughter is 1/2 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“...and if there is only one daughter, then she shall have half the inheritance.” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.12">4:12</a>]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of shares in this case is calculated as follows: 1/2 for the daughter + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 0.96.</p>
<p>To illustrate, if the deceased left behind $1000, according to the Qur'an, the judge would only need to distribute $960 among the heirs, leaving $40 remaining.</p>
<p>When confronted with this mathematical error, Muhammad found it impossible to rectify. As a solution, he advised them to allocate the remaining portion of the estate to the nearest "male" relative <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(Source: </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/23/2">Sahih Muslim, 1615a</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">). This is known as </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/133406/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AB">'Asbah عصبة</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></p>
<p>While the remaining amount of $40 USD in this particular scenario may appear insignificant for the next male relative, little did Muhammad know that it would turn out to be a fatal mistake. This error resulted in Islamic rulings that are deemed ridiculous, illogical, and unjust towards women.</p>
<p>Allow me to provide a few examples to demonstrate the unjust nature of these inheritance laws, and your human intellect will naturally recognize their lack of wisdom.</p>
<p>Numerous online Islamic inheritance calculators are available. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://inheritance.ilmsummit.org/">Calculator 1</a> (A simple Islamic inheritance calculator).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.inheritance-calculator.com/">Calculator 2</a> (A detailed Islamic inheritance calculator)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please use any online calculator to verify the following examples. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1st Example: Old Widow will get 25%, while a “MALE” relative (even a distant one like a cousin, or his son, or his grandson) will get 75% </strong></p>
<p>In the case where the deceased has no children but only a wife and a distant male relative (such as a cousin, son, or grandson), the distribution of shares would be as follows:</p>
<p>The widow will receive 25% of the inheritance, while the "male" relative, regardless of their proximity, will receive the remaining 75%.</p>

</table>
<p>In the case of a wife who remains with her husband throughout her life, it may seem unjust that when she becomes a widow in her old age, she is entitled to only 25% of the inheritance. Meanwhile, the remaining 75% of the inheritance is awarded to a distant male relative, such as a cousin or any of his descendants, whom the deceased person may have never even encountered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this arrangement appear sensible to you?</li>
<li>Can you discern any divine wisdom in this particular Islamic law?</li>
<li>Do you believe that justice has been served to women by Muhammad/Allah in this regard?</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the opposite scenario does not hold true. If a woman passes away, her husband will inherit all her property, regardless of the presence of her closest relatives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2nd Example: Mother will get 33.33%, while distant relatives (like cousins, or his son, or his grandson) will get 66.67%</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, if the deceased person has an old mother and a distant male relative, the distribution of shares would be as follows:</p>
<table id="dgSharesIndiv" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 38.0997%; height: 136px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1" rules="all" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">

</table>
<p>Therefore, in this case, the old mother will receive only 33.33% of the inheritance, while a cousin (or his descendants, whom the deceased person may not have even encountered in his entire life) will receive 66.67%.</p>
<p>One might question the rationale behind this distribution and whether any divine wisdom can be perceived in it.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Example: Sister will get much more share in inheritance than the mother and the wife</strong></p>
<p>Even if the sister is married, she will still receive a larger share of the inheritance compared to the mother or the wife.</p>

<p>Despite the closer bond between a mother and her son, the illogical distribution of shares dictated by the Quran results in the sister receiving a larger inheritance portion than the mother (even if the sister is married).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the widow's share is even smaller than that of the mother, while the sister's share becomes even more substantial.</p>

<p>These inequitable and absurd divisions are a result of the illogical Islamic laws of inheritance, which lack any divine wisdom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>(2) When SHARES make MORE than the Estate (An <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance">'Awl عول</a> Case)</strong></span></span></p>
<p>For instance, in the case where an individual passes away, leaving behind three daughters, parents, and wife, the distribution of inheritance would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The share of the three daughters is 2/3 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“...If (the heirs of the deceased are) more than two daughters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.12">4:12</a>]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of shares in this scenario is calculated as 2/3 for the daughters + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 1.125.</p>
<p>In other words, if the deceased left behind 1000 dinars, according to the Quran, the judge would require 1125 dinars to distribute among the heirs, which exceeds the available amount.</p>
<p>Muhammad passed away without providing any solution to rectify this mathematical mistake in the Quran or Hadith.</p>
<p>Later, a similar case was presented to 'Umar Ibn Khattab, and he also found himself at a loss regarding what to do. However, someone suggested that he proportionally reduce the share of all heirs, and 'Umar adopted this "self-made" solution in an attempt to address the mathematical error in the Quran <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">). </span></p>
<p>However, Ibn Abbas disagreed with 'Umar's approach, and Shia Muslims also have a different perspective. They proposed an alternative "self-fabricated" solution (<a href="https://www.bzu.edu.pk/PJIR/vol10/eng%206%20Shahbaz%20Cheema%2004-11-13.pdf#page=9">link</a>).</p>

<h3>Scientific Blunders in the Quran</h3>
<p>According to Islam, Allah is believed to be completely 100% perfect. As a result, if it can be demonstrated that there is even a "single" scientific error in the Islamic revelation, it would undermine the entire foundation of Islam, which is built upon the premise of Allah's 100% infallibility. Modern Science is an ultimate weapon which will expose false religions and dismantle their claims sooner or later.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This section is about understanding the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ORIGIN</strong></span> of the challenge of inimitability. The Pagans challenged Muhammad (and his Allah) to "<strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">Bring a Miracle</span></strong>" as proof of his prophethood. However, Muhammad and his Allah failed constantly to perform any miracle in front of the pagans. Subsequently, Muhammad started making different <strong>EXCUSES </strong>for his inability to show any miracle, and this challenge of "inimitability" was one of those <strong>excuses </strong>Muhammad used to deflect the original pagan's challenge of showing any miracle.</p>
<p>This we can see directly in the Quran where the pagans challenged Muhammad to bring a miracle. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/21/5/default.htm">21:5</a>:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">بَلْ قَالُوٓا۟ أَضْغَٰثُ أَحْلَٰمٍۭ بَلِ ٱفْتَرَىٰهُ</span> بَلْ هُوَ شَاعِرٌ فَلْيَأْ<span style="font-size: 1rem;">تِنَا بِـَٔايَةٍ كَمَآ أُرْسِلَ ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ</span></p>
<div class="stcl2">Yet they say: "These (i.e. the Quranic verses) are only confused dreams," or "He has invented them;" or  "He is only a poet. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Let him therefore <span style="color: #1200ff;">bring a</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">MIRACLE</span> to us as the earlier (apostles) were sent with."</strong></span></div>
</blockquote>
<p>But Muhammad and his Allah were unable to perform even a single miracle in front of pagans.</p>
<p>In order to divert attention from his <strong>failure to perform</strong> a miracle, Muhammad started presenting different <strong>EXCUSES </strong>in the Quran. And the "Quran's Inimitability Challenge" was one of those Muhammad's excuses. Those excuses were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muhammad cannot show a miracle while he is only a human. </li>
<li>Allah would not send a miracle to Muhammad this time while nations of earlier prophets denied the miracles of earlier prophets. </li>
<li>Muhammad should not ask Allah to show a miracle to pagans while Allah has misguided them.</li>
<li>Muhammad would not show the miracle to the Jews while their forefathers sinned.</li>
<li>The miracle of the sky falling on the Meccans did not occur due to Muhammad's presence among them.</li>
<li>Bring a chapter like this Quran.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us see the details about these Quranic Excuses here to understand it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 1st Quranic Excuse: Muhammad cannot show a Miracle while he is only a human</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident occurred in Mecca. Muhammad used to threaten the Meccans, warning them to believe in his prophethood or face the consequences, claiming that his Allah would make the sky fall upon them in fragments. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>: And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "...  <strong>Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">AS YOU HAVE (previously) CLAIMED</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Actually, the pagan Meccans not only accepted this challenge by Muhammad but also extended it and asked Muhammad to show other miracles too and they would believe in his prophethood. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, Muhammad/Allah failed to deliver on this promise.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, Muhammad was forced to come up with an <strong>EXCUSE</strong> for his failure to fulfil his promise and show any miracle. And he made the following excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring. Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>as you have (previously) claimed</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read." <strong> Say: "Glory to my Lord. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(I cannot do it while)</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">I am only man and a messenger</span></em></span></strong></span>." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer of the Quran (i.e., Muhammad himself) attempted to justify his failure to perform miracles by claiming that he was merely a messenger and could not perform miracles.</p>
<p>However, the pagan Meccans had issued this challenge not only to Muhammad <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but also to Muhammad's god <span style="color: #2800ff;">(i.e., Allah was already automatically included in this challenge)</span></strong></span>. They believed that if Allah truly existed, He should have demonstrated a miracle to them.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was Muhammad/Allah who promised that the sky would fall upon them if they didn't believe in Muhammad's prophethood. Yet, both Muhammad and his Allah failed to fulfill their promise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Muhammad's lack of miracles was due to his role as a mere messenger, why did previous prophets demonstrate miracles to validate their prophethood? For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, Cured the blind and the leper and gave life to the dead by God’s permission (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.110">5:110</a> and <a href="https://quranx.com/3.49">3:49</a>).</li>
<li>Moses received nine miracles, including his staff transforming into a dragon, his hand becoming radiant, the plague of locusts/lice, the swarm of frogs, and the parting of the sea for the Children of Israel (Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/17.101">17:101</a>).</li>
<li>Solomon comprehended the language of animals and birds and controlled jinn and winds (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.16?context=2">27:16-17</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/34.12?context=2">34:12-13</a>),</li>
<li>while Joseph interpreted dreams and predicted future events (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.46?context=2">12:46-47</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/40.51?context=2">40:51-52</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the Meccans were correct in their demand. Even the Quran mentioned their argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/21.5">21:5</a>: So let him bring us a sign just <strong>as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles].</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, if the earlier prophets were able to demonstrate miracles despite being humans, why then Muhammad could not?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And then the Quran claims that Allah does not change his PRACTICE (i.e. Sunnah):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.77">17:77</a>:</strong> This has been Our Way with the Messengers whom We sent before you. You will find <strong>no change</strong> in our <strong>Practice</strong> (i.e. the Sunnah of Allah).</p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>:</strong> [This is] the established practice of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the Practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>:</strong> <strong>But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quran presents a contradiction regarding the expectation of miracles from prophets. In one instance, it suggests that prophets are not required to display miracles as evidence of their prophethood, yet in another, it describes earlier prophets performing miracles to prove their legitimacy. This raises a question: Why did earlier prophets show miracles to disbelievers, but Muhammad and his Allah refused to do so?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that the Quran recounts fictional tales of earlier prophets' miracles, which cannot be verified since they took place in the distant past. Conversely, when it came to Muhammad and his Allah, they were expected to perform miracles in real-time, right before the very eyes of the Kuffar Meccans who challenged them. However, they failed to deliver on these expectations.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>PS: </strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This Excuse in the Quranic Verse also challenges those so-called Sahih Islamic Traditions (Ahadith) which claim that Muhammad showed Meccans the miracle of the splitting of the moon. Had Muhammad really split the moon, then he would have presented it to the Kuffar Meccans as proof of his prophethood. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h3>The 2nd Quranic Excuse: Allah would not send a miracle to Muhammad this time while nations of earlier prophets denied the miracles of earlier prophets</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident also happened in Mecca.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58-59</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَسْطُورًا</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِلَّآ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ</span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And We <span style="color: #e03e2d; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REFRAIN </strong></span>from sending the signs (now in front of Kuffar Meccans), <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only because the men of former generations treated them as false</strong></span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meccans repeatedly asked Muhammad for a miracle, but he always offered new excuses for not delivering one. Earlier Muhammad claimed he could not perform any miracle while he was only a human being. But that excuse was shaky as the challenge was not limited to Muhammad only, but his god (i.e. Allah) was also automatically included in that challenge. </p>
<p>Thus, Muhammad was forced to change his excuse. This time, he came up with a new excuse that Allah had ceased sending new miracles/signs since earlier people rejected them.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, Allah's practice (i.e. Sunnah of Allah ) supposedly changed when earlier people denied the signs. However, this contradicts the Quranic CLAIM that Allah's Sunnah never changes.</p>
<p>As they say, where there's a contradiction, there's a lie.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's worth noting that there's also a flaw in Verse 58:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad recounted various tales in the Quran about ancient prophets like Thamud, 'Aad and Saleh etc., describing how their communities were destroyed by Allah. Muhammad presumed that nobody could fact-check his accounts by journeying into the past. However, he made a critical error.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that, according to the Quran, Jesus also performed miracles in front of the Jews and Romans. He spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, cured the blind and the leper, and even brought the dead back to life, all by God's permission (Quran 5:110 and 3:49). Yet, neither the Jews nor the Romans believed in him. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Despite this, neither the Jews nor the Romans of Jesus's era were destroyed </strong></span>(<span style="color: #0000ff;">which again goes against the Quranic Promise of Destruction</span>).</p>
<p>The incident of Jesus took place in the recent past, making it feasible to verify its authenticity through historical records. Thus, this claim in the Quran has been exposed as a lie.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The 3rd Excuse: Muhammad shouldn't ask Allah for a Miracle while Allah had misguided the Pagans</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the previous two excuses naturally failed to satisfy people regarding Muhammad's/Allah's inability to show any miracle. They continued to ask Muhammad to bring a miracle as proof of his prophethood. To deflect their demand, Muhammad introduced another excuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>He (Muhammad) cannot ask Allah for any miracle because Allah does not want the pagans to be guided.</li>
<li>And if he (Muhammad) persists in asking Allah for a miracle, then Allah will punish him, and he (Muhammad) will be among the ignorant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/6/35/default.htm">6:35</a>:</p>
<p>وَإِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكَ إِعْرَاضُهُمْ فَإِنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتَ أَن تَبْتَغِىَ نَفَقًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَوْ سُلَّمًا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَأْتِيَهُم <strong>بِـَٔايَةٍ</strong> ۚ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَمَعَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ ۚ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ</p>
<p>If you (O Muhammad) find rejection by the unbelievers so unbearable, then seek a tunnel into the ground or a ladder into the sky in order to bring them a <strong>SIGN</strong>, but [remember that], <strong>had God willed it</strong>, <strong>He would have guided all of them. Do not be among the ignorant (by asking a SIGN from Allah)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more, this verse serves as evidence that no miracle was shown to the Meccan disbelievers by Muhammad/Allah. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h3>The 4th Quranic Excuse: Muhammad will not show the miracle to the Jews while their forefathers sinned</h3>
<p>This incident happened just after Muhammad's migration to Medina when he had to prove his prophethood to the Jews of Medina. </p>
<p>The Bible contains several passages that highlight the phenomenon of divine acceptance of a person's sacrificial offering through the appearance of a mysterious fire that consumes the offering. These instances can be found in verses such as Judges 6:20-21, 13:19-20, and 2 Chronicles 7:1-2.</p>
<p>Actually, Muhammad had already made a mistake, and he had also previously confirmed this method of the miracle of fire in the Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.27">5:27</a>, in the story of Adam and his sons, where a fire appeared and consumed the offering of one son who sacrificed a sheep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/5.27"> 5:27</a>:</p>
<p>Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one, but not from the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tafsir Tabari, under verse 5:27 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=3&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was narrated from as-Suddi, in his narration from Abu Maalik and from Abu Saalih from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Murrah from Ibn Mas‘ood, and from some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ... Habeel (Abel) offered a fat lamb as his offering, while Qabeel (Cain) presented a sheaf of corn but secretly took out and consumed a large portion of the corn. Subsequently, fire descended from the heavens and consumed Habeel's offering, while Qabeel's offering remained untouched and unaccepted. In response, Qabeel became enraged and threatened to kill Habeel, vowing that he would not allow him to marry his sister.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220428104808/https://dorar.net/h/808e9bbf2bff4252bd3830e50578ec2d"> Sahih (Albani)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, when Muhammad asserted his prophethood, the Jews asked him to provide proof through the manifestation of a miracle, specifically the fire consuming his offering.</p>
<p>Muhammad found himself unable to dismiss this demand outright, as he already acknowledged it in the story of Adam in the Quran.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad resorted to a different approach, offering a new excuse. He accepted the validity of the miracle involving the fire accepting the offering, but he refused to showcase this miracle. He justified his inability to show this miracle by accusing the Jews of Medina that their forefathers sinned by killing previous prophets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/3.183?context=3"> 3:183</a>:</p>
<p>They (the Jews) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in any messenger <strong>unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire</strong> (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: <strong>why then did ye slay them</strong>, if ye speak the truth?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this excuse by the writer of the Quran does not hold up under scrutiny for several reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is unjust to punish individuals for the sins of their ancestors. In this case, the writer of the Quran is essentially claiming to hold the Jews of his time accountable for the actions of their forefathers. This contradicts the concept of divine justice, which does not attribute guilt based on lineage.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Jews of Muhammad's era maintained a strong belief in their own holy scriptures, which also indicated that the proof of prophethood involved successfully passing the miracle test. It is understandable that they would request the same evidence from Muhammad and, upon his failure to provide it, reject his claims. This rejection cannot be seen as their fault, as they were simply following the principles outlined in their own religious texts.</p>
<p>Ironically, when the Jewish holy books seemingly predicted the arrival of Muhammad (<a href="https://www.judaism-islam.com/muhammad-in-the-torah-bible/">according to Muslim claims</a>), Muhammad expected the Jews to adhere to their own scriptures. However, when those same holy books instructed them to seek the miracle of fire as a validation of prophethood, Muhammad wanted them to abandon that requirement. This double standard raises questions about consistency and fairness.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the writer of the Quran contradicts his own claims within the text. The Quran repeatedly asserts that the practices of Allah remain unchanging. Yet, in this instance, Muhammad is deviating from that principle by rejecting the miracle of fire as a valid proof of prophethood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>: [This is] the established way of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>: <strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Muhammad was unable to perform the miracle of fire in front of the Jews, a sudden shift occurred in the ways of Allah to accommodate his inability to demonstrate miracles.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it is worth noting that compared to the ancestors of the Jews, the ancestors of the <strong>pagan Meccans (Mushrikeen)</strong> did not have a history of killing prophets. However, Muhammad didn't show any miracle to them too by making other excuses. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad got so much exposure in this incident, that despite all his struggles to make the Jews of Medina happy in the beginning (by adopting many Biblical laws in Islamic Sharia), not even 10 Jews of Medina believed in him and converted to Islam;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3941">Sahih Bukhari, 3941</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Prophet said: <span class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">"Had only ten Jews believe me, all the Jews would definitely have believed me."</strong></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 5th Quranic Excuse: The Miracle of the Sky Falling on the Meccans Did Not Occur due to Muhammad's Presence Among Them</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident happened later in Medina after Muhammad had also failed to show the miracle of fire to the Jews.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In Mecca, Muhammad used to threaten the Kuffar Meccans that Allah would let the sky fall on them if they don't believe in his prophethood. But Muhammad (along with his Allah) failed to deliver his promise of this punishment. Later, Muhammad flee to Medina (leaving Mecca), but people kept on asking questions about his failure to deliver his promise of falling of the sky upon the Kuffar Meccans. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This compelled Muhammad to come up with an ADDITIONAL Excuse.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad claimed the revelation of the following verses, which claim that Allah didn't let the sky fall upon Kuffar Meccans at that time while Muhammad was also present there among them, and Allah didn't want him to be harmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/8.32?context=2">8:32</a>: </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And when they [Meccans] said, "O Allah, if this should be the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment."<strong> But Allah did not punish them while you, [O Muhammad], was among them</strong>, and Allah would not punish them while they sought forgiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses were revealed in Medina after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Badr">Battle of Badr</a> (in the 2nd Hijri Year), in which Muhammad got the victory against the Meccan pagans. </p>
<p>Two pertinent questions arise from this narrative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, why did Allah not choose to punish the Meccans with the miracle of the falling sky during Muhammad's absence or after his migration to Medina? This query is particularly intriguing since Muhammad had previously asserted that Allah would send this miracle as a sign of his prophethood.</li>
<li>Secondly, the Meccans did not solely request the miracle of punishment; rather, they sought any miraculous manifestation (even without any punishment), similar to those experienced by the previous prophets, that could substantiate Muhammad's claim to prophethood. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Please see the following verse again where they are also asking Muhammad for any miracle (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>even without punishment</strong></span>), and they were ready to believe in his prophethood. </span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(1)</strong></span> you break open for us from the ground a spring. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(2)</strong></span> Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the SKY FALL UPON US IN FRAGMENTS AS YOU HAVE CLAIMED <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(3)</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(4)</strong></span> Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(5)</strong></span> or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read."  Say: "Glory to my Lord. (I cannot do it while) I am only man and a messenger." </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, Muhammad along with his Allah failed to show even any simple miracle without any punishment, as it happened in the cases of previous prophets. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h3>The 6th Quranic Excuse: Bring a chapter like this</h3>
<p>This excuse also served as part of Muhammad's strategy to divert attention from the pagan's challenge to bring a miracle.</p>
<p>The pagans used to demand Muhammad to bring a miracle as proof of his prophethood. Instead of providing a miracle, Muhammad would counter by challenging them to bring a chapter like the Quran.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/29.51?context=2">29:50-51</a>:</p>
<p>وَقَالُوا۟ لَوْلَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَٰتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْءَايَٰتُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ </p>
<p>But they say, "<strong>Why are not signs (miracles) sent down to him from his Lord</strong>?" Say, "<strong>The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner</strong>." <strong>And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book </strong>which is recited to them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this strategy failed, as not a SINGLE pagan or Jew accepted Islam due to the Quran and its inimitability challenge (as discussed in part 1 of this article), and Allah (i.e. Muhammad) was exposed to them due to his inability to show any miracle despite initially giving threats of miraculous punishment himself. </p>
<h4>The timeline of verses regarding the inimitability challenge:</h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the pagans (and later the Jews of Medina) would ask Muhammad for a miracle as proof of his prophethood. The last verse addressing this demand for miracles was <a href="https://quranx.com/8.32?context=2">8:32</a>, revealed in the 2nd Hijri year (after the Battle of Badr). For the following 8 years in Medina (until Muhammad's death), no further verses were revealed regarding this demand for a miracle challenge.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the last verse about the inimitability challenge also came in the 2nd Hijri year, and for the subsequent 8 years in Medina (until Muhammad's death), no additional verses were revealed concerning the inimitability challenge.</p>
<p>The verses regarding the inimitability challenge are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Surah Yunus <a class="mw-redirect" title="Q10:38" href="https://quranx.com/10.38">10:38</a></li>
<li>Surah Hud <a class="mw-redirect" title="Q11:13" href="https://quranx.com/11.13">11:13</a></li>
<li>Surah at-Tur <a class="mw-redirect" title="Q52:34" href="https://quranx.com/52.34">52:34</a></li>
<li>Surah al-Isra <a class="mw-redirect" title="Q17:88" href="https://quranx.com/17.88">17:88</a></li>
<li>Surah al-Baqara  <a class="mw-redirect" title="Q2:23" href="https://quranx.com/2.23">2:23</a></li>
</ol>
<p>All these verses are from the Meccan period, except for Surah al-Baqara, which was revealed during the initial period after migration to Medina.</p>
<p>The question arises: Why did Muhammad consistently repeat the inimitability challenge in Mecca but cease in Medina, refraining from repeating it during the last 8 years of the Medinian period?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that the demand to "Bring a Miracle" also ceased after the initial period in Medina. Following the victory in the Battle of Badr, Muhammad gained absolute power in Medina, and no one dared to challenge him to bring a miracle as proof of his prophethood. The Jewish tribes of Medina were divided, engaged in internal conflicts, and outnumbered by the Muslim tribes of Aws and Khazraj.</p>
<p>Therefore, Muhammad neither made further excuses regarding his inability to perform miracles after the Battle of Badr, nor did he need to reiterate his challenge of the Quran's inimitability.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Double Standards: Muhammad consistently refused to display any miracle as evidence of his prophethood, yet he demanded others to exhibit miracles of their prophethood</h2>
<p>As you've seen, Muhammad always denied showcasing any miracle of his prophethood. However, consider the following tradition:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3055">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3055</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Ibn 'Umar: Umar and a group of the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) set out with the Prophet to Ibn Saiyad. He found him playing with some boys near the hillocks of Bani Maghala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty. He did not notice (the Prophet's presence) till the Prophet (ﷺ) stroked him on the back with his hand and said, "Ibn Saiyad! Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, "<em>I testify that you are the Apostle of the illiterates</em>." Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet. "<em>Do you testify that I am the apostle of Allah</em>?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, "I believe in Allah and His Apostles." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to Ibn Saiyad). "What do you see?" Ibn Saiyad replied, "True people and false ones visit me." The Prophet said, "Your mind is confused as to this matter."<em><strong> The Prophet (ﷺ) added, " I have kept something (in my mind) for you." Ibn Saiyad said, "It is Ad-Dukh." The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Shame be on you! You cannot cross your limits.</strong></em>" On that 'Umar said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allow me to chop his head off." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "If he should be him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) then you cannot overpower him, and should he not be him, then you are not going to benefit by murdering him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad never demonstrated a miracle to others as evidence of his prophethood and offered various excuses.</li>
<li>But when Ibn Siyad failed to display a miracle on the spot, Muhammad IMMEDIATELY accused him of being a false prophet.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In simple words, these are Double Standards. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Message:</strong></h2>
<p>Where there are <em><strong>contradictions</strong></em>, there are always <em><strong>lies </strong></em>present there.</p>
<p>Dear Muslims!</p>
<p>Please don't let anyone fool you anymore, and let you swallow all these contradictions in the name of religion. </p>
<p>Dr. Ali Shariati wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the birth of holy prophet (pbuh), <strong>enormous fire of Zoroastrians which had been burning for thousands of years in Istihrabad suddenly died out, fourteen towers of Kisra’s Palace in the city of Madayin fell down, but it effected not a single person in Mecca. It would have been a better if all 360 idols in Ka'ba would have fell down, so that the people of Meccan would know that something special happened on that day. But no such thing happened. (Ref: Dr. Ali Shariati, Book 23 Years). </strong></p>

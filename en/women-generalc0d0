<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:15"><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:181">Do you know that there is absolutely no mention of any Houris in the thousands of pages of the Old Testament and the New Testament? It was Muhammad who later made it all up himself.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:247">By the time of Muhammad (i.e., 7th century AD), the stories of many religions and cultures had reached Arabia. Muhammad mixed all of those stories from different religions and <span class="citation-0">cultures in order to form his new religion of Islam. For example:</span></p>
<ul data-sourcepos="9:1-12:0">
<li data-sourcepos="9:1-9:88"><span class="citation-0 citation-end-0">Muhammad took the basic idea of his new religion from Judaism</span> and Christianity.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="10:1-10:220">At the same time, Muhammad also introduced the Hajj rituals of pagan Arabs into Islamic Sharia. This suited his new religion and gave it strength by connecting with pagan Arabs through the continuation of Hajj rituals.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="11:1-12:0">Muhammad also took many practices from Zoroastrians, such as praying five times a day, wearing head coverings during prayers, the Ascension to Heaven, ritual purification before prayer, and the Bridge over Hell (Islamic Pul-Sirat). (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210316190807/https://lampofislam.wordpress.com/2020/09/01/zoroastrian-influence-on-traditional-islam/">link</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Muhammad also took the concept of houris from Zoroastrianism (<a href="https://darbyblion.com/?p=2334">link</a>). This helped him to entice men into joining his new religion and also to wage wars for him in the greed of getting houris by becoming martyrs.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId105003"></a>Question: If Muslim men receive Houris in Paradise, then what will pious Muslim women receive in Paradise?</h2>
<p>The Quran remains silent on what pious Muslim women will receive in Paradise, despite its numerous descriptions of Houris for men. However, a Hadith suggests that women will be reunited with their last husbands as their companions in Paradise.</p>
<p>This Hadith is as under:</p>
<p>Imaam al-Tabaraani said in his book al-Mu’jam al-Awsat, 3/275:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>خطب معاوية بن أبى سفيان أم الدرداء بعد وفاة أبي الدرداء فقالت أم الدرداء إني سمعت أبا الدرداء يقول سمعت رسول الله  صلى الله عليه وسلم  يقول أيما امرأة توفي عنها زوجها فتزوجت بعده فهي لآخر أزواجها وما كنت لأختارك على أبي الدرداء </p>
<p>Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan proposed marriage to Umm al-Darda’ after Abu’l-Darda’ had passed away. Umm al-Darda’ said: I heard Abu’l-Darda’ say: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say:<strong><em> any woman whose husband dies and she marries someone else after him, she will be with the last of her husbands (in paradise), and I would not choose you over Abu’l-Darda’</em></strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even this reward for women in paradise is also problematic, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Hadith ultimately stops a poor widow Muslim woman from remarrying in this world due to the fear of not being able to reunite with her deceased husband in paradise.</li>
<li>What if she loves someone else but is forced to marry a person (for example, an old man) whom she never loved throughout her married life?</li>
<li>Even if we assume that a woman in this world will also become beautiful in paradise (like Houris) and remain a virgin whom her husband can deflower every time, it is still a reward for the man and not for the woman.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: There is another tradition that claims women will get their favorite husband in paradise, but that Hadith is considered 'extremely weak' by Muslim authorities (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10053/will-men-in-paradise-have-intercourse-with-al-hoor-aliyn">link</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, both the Quran and Ahadith are completely silent about the fate of a female believer who dies unmarried or was married to a man who will not enter Paradise.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId230917"></a>Why are women denied the opportunity to enjoy 72 male Houris?</h2>
<p>The concept of physical pleasures, including sex, drinking, and eating, being available in paradise was introduced by Allah/Muhammad. As such, men will be granted 72 virgin Houris to indulge in physical intimacy whenever they desire.</p>
<p>While sex may or may not be a factor, women undeniably require <strong>Companionship and Affection</strong>.</p>
<p>One wonders what harm could come from providing women with the companionship, affection and love of attractive young males (غلمان), or male Houris? Women would surely relish their company and might even experience love through sexual interaction with them. After all, love is an integral aspect of sexual intimacy, and women are known to appreciate it.</p>
<p>Instead, women are left waiting for their husbands, who will be preoccupied with their 72 Houris. This raises the question: Why should women not be endowed with the unique ability to savour the love and companionship of 100 male Houris simultaneously, just as men will purportedly possess the enhanced strength of a hundred? </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2536">Jami' at-Tirmidhi 2536:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (s.a.w) said: "The believer shall be given in paradise such and such strength in intercourse ." it was said: "O Messenger of Allah! And will he able to do that?" He said: "<strong>He will be given the strength of a hundred.</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This begs the question: Why should women be subjected to double standards when it comes to sexual pleasure and intimacy in the afterlife? Instead of receiving equal treatment, women are expected to patiently await their spouses, who'll presumably be preoccupied with their 72 Houris. It's worth noting that women also naturally crave sexual satisfaction and experience profound love during this act.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId510828"></a>Threatening women to obey their husbands through curses and mocking by Houris</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We all know about Islamic brainwashing: if women don't allow their husbands to rape them, then angels curse them the whole night. But this is not the only curse that women receive; they are also cursed and mocked by the army of Houris if their husbands are merely annoyed.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:1174">Jami` at-Tirmidhi, Hadith 1174</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet said, "No woman annoys her husband in this world except that his wife among the Al-Huril-Ain says, 'Do not annoy him, may Allah destroy you, he is only like a guest with us, soon he will part from you for us.'"</p>

</blockquote>
<p>However, in contrast, if a Muslim husband annoys his wife, there are no male Houris present to curse and mock him. Even if a Muslim husband beats his wife brutally, he has full permission for that, and no male Houris are present to curse him. That is why, even the Sahaba (male companions) of Muhammad used to beat their wives even more brutally than non-Muslims, but Muhammad never threatened them with the curse of angels or any male Houris.</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5825/">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5825:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rifa`a divorced his wife whereupon `AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. `Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her <strong>a green spot</strong> (bruise) on her skin caused by severe beating).<strong> It was the habit of ladies to support each other</strong>, so when Allah's Apostle came, <strong>`Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women (i.e. even the non-Muslim men don't beat their non-believing women so brutally)</strong>.<strong> Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many Sahaba, including Zubair Ibn 'Awam, who was among the ten most esteemed companions, were known for beating their wives. Despite this, they were never threatened with curses from angels or the presence of male Houris. Why the double standards?</p>

<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(5) Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/2.25">2:25</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ ۖ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُوا۟ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقًا ۙ قَالُوا۟ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ ۖ وَأُتُوا۟ بِهِۦ مُتَشَٰبِهًا ۖ وَلَهُمْ فِيهَآ <strong>أَزْوَٰجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ</strong> ۖ وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ</p>
<p>And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, "This is what we were provided with before." And it is given to them in likeness.<strong> </strong>And they will have therein <strong><em>purified spouses</em></strong>, and they will abide therein eternally<strong>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Islam apologists attempt to deceive by claiming that this verse refers to Muslim women of this world, who will be wives of men in Paradise. However, this interpretation is incorrect, as the Arabic word Azwaj (أَزْوَٰجٌ) is used, and in previous verses <a href="https://quranx.com/44.54">44:54</a> and <a href="https://quranx.com/52.20">52:20</a>, the same word is used by the Quran to refer to the marriage of Houris with men in Paradise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the number of pious Muslim women is fewer than pious Muslim men, as most of them will be in Hell, according to Muhammad <a href="https://bewley.virtualave.net/bukhari4.html#6">Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 6, Hadith 298</a>). Therefore, every pious man in Paradise cannot have multiple wives if Muslim women of this world are meant here. The condition of multiple wives for pious Muslim men can only be fulfilled in the case of Houris.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Surah Baqarah was revealed during the Meccan period, while the following Hadith indicates that until the Medinan period, there was no verse in the Quran regarding women in Paradise.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3211">Jami` at-Tirmidhi, Hadith 3211</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Umm 'Umarah Al-Ansariyyah: that she came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: "<strong><em>I do not see but that everything is for the men, and I do not see anything being mentioned for the women.</em></strong>" So this Ayah was revealed: Verily men and women who have come to submission, men and women who are believers, men and women who are devout, truthful men and truthful women, men and women with endurance, men and women who are modest, men and women who give alms, men and women who observe fasting, men and women who guard their private parts, and those men and women who remember God a great deal, for them God <strong>has forgiveness and a great reward</strong>. (Verse <a href="https://quranx.com/33.35">33:35</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>She is an Ansariyyah woman, which proves that until that time in the Medinan period, nothing had been revealed in the Quran about women in Paradise. Moreover, Surah Ahzab (i.e., verse 33:35) was also revealed in Medina.</p>
<p>Therefore, it also proves that the verse of Surah Baqarah (<a href="https://quranx.com/2.25">2:25</a>) refers to Houris and not to Muslim women of this world, while Surah Baqarah was revealed earlier in the Meccan period.</p>
<p>Additionally, Umm Salama (Muhammad's wife) also noted the same thing - that nothing had been revealed in the Quran about women (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/170975/the-woman-companion-because-of-whom-the-verse-3335-was-revealed">link</a>). She also wed Muhammad only in Medina.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(6) Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.57">4:57</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا ۖ لَّهُمْ فِيهَآ<strong><em> أَزْوَٰجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ</em></strong> ۖ وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِلًّا ظَلِيلًا</p>
<p>But those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. For them therein are <em><strong>purified spouses</strong></em>, and We will admit them to deepening shade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3254">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3254</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The first batch (of people) <em><strong>who will enter Paradise</strong></em> will be (glittering) like the full moon, and the batch next to them will be (glittering) like the most brilliant star in the sky. Their hearts will be as if the heart of a single man, for they will have neither enmity nor jealousy amongst themselves; <em><strong>everyone will have two (to 72) wives (depending of their status) from the houris</strong>, (who will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the bones and the flesh</em>."</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>(7) Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/43.70">43:70</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ٱدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْجَنَّةَ أَنتُمْ وَ<strong>أَزْوَٰجُكُمْ </strong>تُحْبَرُونَ</p>
<p>Enter Paradise, you and your spouses delighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Surah Zukhruf was also revealed in Mecca, and we know nothing was revealed in Quran for women there. Thus, again Houris are meant here from spouses and not the worldly wives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(8) Quran: <a href="https://quranx.com/56.35?context=3">56:35-37</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَٰهُنَّ إِنشَآءًفَجَعَلْنَٰهُنَّ أَبْكَارًاعُرُبًا أَتْرَابًا</p>
<p>Indeed, We [We] have produced them (into) a creation, And We have made them virgins, loving and of matching age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Islam apologists try to claim this verse is not about Houris but about pious Muslim women of this world. But they are again refuted by the fact that this Surah 56 (i.e. Surah Waqiya) was also revealed in Mecca. Moreover, see the following hadith.</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">

<p>Moreover, the previous verses have no mention of Muslim women of this world but they only mention Houris in paradise (see Verse <a href="https://quranx.com/56.22?context=3">56:22-23</a>). This also proves that verses <a href="https://quranx.com/56.35?context=3">56:35-37</a> are not for pious Muslim women of this world, but about Houris.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(9) Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/55.56">55:56</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>فِيهِنَّ قَٰصِرَٰتُ ٱلطَّرْفِ لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلَا جَآنٌّ</p>
<p>In the midst of these shall be maidens with modest, restrained glances; maidens whom no man or jinn has ever touched before.</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(10) Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/78.33?context=3">78:31-33</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>اِنَّ لِلۡمُتَّقِیۡنَ مَفَازًا حَدَآئِقَ وَ اَعۡنَابًا <strong>وَّکَوَاعِبَ</strong> اَتۡرَابًا</p>
<p>Verily for the Righteous there will be a fulfilment of (the heart's) desires; Gardens enclosed, and grapevines; And <em><strong>full-breasted voluptuous girls [i.e. Houris]</strong></em> of equal age</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of this verse (<a href="https://archive.org/details/TafsirIbnKathirVolume0110English_201702">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word (<strong>کَوَاعِبَ</strong>) has been interpreted to refer to <em><strong>"fully developed" or "round" breasts</strong></em> ... they meant by this that the breasts of these girls will be fully rounded and not sagging, because they will be virgins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quran explicitly mentions at least 10 times that men will receive beautiful Houris in Paradise. However, there is not a single verse that describes what women will receive in Paradise. This raises a question about the inspiration and motivation for women. Why does the Quran only describe the benefits for men and neglect to provide any such description for women?</p>
<p>Apologists argue that the mention of Houris serves to inspire men towards achieving Jannah. However, this response creates a double standard since it fails to address the lack of inspiration for women. If the purpose of describing Houris is truly to inspire both genders equally, then why did the Quran not include similar descriptions of male companions for women?</p>
<p>This discrepancy highlights a fundamental flaw in the argument that the Quran treats both men and women equally. It appears that the Quran caters primarily to the desires and aspirations of men, leaving women without equal representation or consideration.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId490174"></a>Quran and Ahadith are full of mention of the BEAUTY of Houris, but both are empty about the beauty of Muslim women in paradise</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">While the Quranic passages analyzed earlier highlight the alluring nature of Houris, there are no corresponding verses that extol the virtues of earthly women who will join their spouses in Paradise. Similarly, Ahadith accounts that detail the attributes of Houris are abundant, yet there are no parallel narratives that celebrate the beauty and grace of female believers.</span></p>

<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "...<em>every man will have two (to 72) wives from the houris, <strong>(who will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the bones and the flesh</strong></em><strong>.</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2796">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 2796</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "...<em> And if an houri from Paradise appeared to the people of the earth, she would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world and whatever is in it</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are hundreds of Ahadith recorded by Muslim scholars that describe the beauty of Houris, including their vaginas. For instance, one hadith states that all Houris will have libidinous vaginas, while Muslim men will have an eternal erection in their penises. </p>
<p>Please read the following article at <a href="https://wikiislam.net">WikiIslam.net</a> for details: <a href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Houri_%28Heavenly_Virgin%29">Houri (Heavenly Virgin)</a></p>
<p>Moreover, Maulana Tariq Jamil of Pakistan is known for his speeches that elaborate on these Ahadith, describing the beauty of Houris and how Muslim men will deflower them repeatedly, as well as the length and enjoyment of the sexual acts, and how they will continue for eternity.</p>
<p>In contrast, both the Quran and Ahadith lack mentions of the beauty of Muslim women in paradise. Islamic apologists justify this discrepancy by arguing that the emphasis on Houris is meant to inspire Muslim men. However, this raises questions about inspiring Muslim women.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that there aren't any verses in the Quran that encourage men to treat their wives well by promising them that their wives will be even more beautiful than Houris in paradise, and that they will receive their wives' companionship there if they treat them well.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Some scholars have attempted to fill this gap by claiming that Muslim women will be more beautiful than Houris in paradise. However, these claims are not supported by any authentic Quranic verses or Hadith. Instead, they appear to be based on personal interpretations and biases. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId38306"></a>Islam Apologists: It is in the nature of man to wish to have multiple women for sex, but women don't wish to have multiple partners</h2>
<p>Islamic Apologists argue that it's innate for men to desire multiple female partners for sexual gratification, yet women supposedly don't share this inclination. If this argument holds water, then shouldn't it follow that women naturally want to showcase their physical attractiveness and seek male admiration? And wouldn't it make sense for Islam to accommodate this aspect of human nature, just as it purportedly caters to men's desires?</p>
<p>However, the reality is that Islam restricts women's expression of their natural instincts while catering exclusively to men's wants. Women inherently require more time, attention, love, and affection from their partners. But Islam suppresses these fundamental aspects of women's nature by permitting polygamy and also allowing Muslim men to do sex with dozens of slave girls, leaving wives to wait patiently for their husbands to finish indulging in the company of 72 celestial virgins.</p>
<p>This oppressive treatment of women under Islam extends beyond this mortal realm; in paradise, Muslim husbands will allegedly be preoccupied with their heavenly brides, leaving their earthly spouses to languish in neglect. Why does Allah seemingly disregard the natural needs and desires of women, both in this life and the next?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId941044"></a>Islam apologists: The term Hūr refers both to pure men and pure women</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists have struggled to provide equal paradisaical rewards for Muslim women as they have for Muslim men, particularly regarding the latter's sexual activities with Houris. In response, some modern apologists have attempted to reinterpret the Quranic term Hūr as referring to both virtuous men and women.</p>
<p>However, this explanation won't suffice, as the Quran explicitly states in verses <a href="https://quranx.com/55.70?context=6">55:70-76</a> that these Houris are untouched by any man or jinn before them, thereby implying a feminine gender. Furthermore, the concept of Houris is consistently presented as a reward for faithful men, with no mention of a similar reward for women.</p>
<p>Muhammad's teachings on Houris, as recorded in various Hadiths, further reinforce the notion that Houris are female and exist primarily as sexual objects for male believers. The question remains whether modern Islamic apologists truly believe they possess a deeper understanding of the Quran than Muhammad himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId365664"></a>Islam apologists: The concept of Houris is only allegorical and not literal</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists argue that the reference to Houris should be understood allegorically, rather than literally. For example, <a title="Muhammad Asad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Asad">Muhammad Asad</a>, a modern Islamic scholar, cites Quran 32:17 as evidence that the idea of Houris is meant to symbolize spiritual rewards rather than physical pleasure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/32.17">32:17</a>: No one knows what delights of the eyes are kept hidden for them as a reward for their deeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p>Muhammad (the prophet of Islam) knew Quran better than <a title="Muhammad Asad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Asad">Muhammad Asad</a>, but he never took the concept of Houris to be allegorical, but totally literal in his Ahadith where he mentioned them as beautiful sexual objects. So, who is then <a title="Muhammad Asad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Asad">Muhammad Asad</a> to refute the understanding of Muhammad (the prophet of Islam)?</p>
<p>Even Quran is itself clear that it is not allegorical but literal when it describes the marriage with Houris, who had never been touched by any man or jinn before. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It was Muhammad, who</span><span class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU" style="font-size: 1rem;"> just made it all up</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> to entice men into joining his new religion and to wage wars for him in greed of getting houris by becoming martyrs. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Therefore, Muhammad didn't care much about the Muslim women in paradise, but he was only interested in telling what men will get in paradise if they accept Islam and get martyrdom in this life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In fact, Muhammad told in Ahadith that normal Muslim men will get 2 Houris, but martyrs will get 72 Houris:</span></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated"><a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:1663">Jami` at-Tirmidhi, Hadith 1663</a>:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">Narrated Al-Miqdam bin Ma'diykarib: That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "There are six things with Allah for the martyr. He is forgiven with the first flow of blood (he suffers), he is shown his place in Paradise, he is protected from punishment in the grave, secured from the greatest terror, the crown of dignity is placed upon his head - and its gems are better than the world and what is in it - <em><strong>he is married to seventy two wives along Al-Huril-'Ayn of Paradise</strong></em>, and he may intercede for seventy of his close relatives." [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad was indeed a smart and clever person, and a master of religious brainwashing by fabricating stories. Unfortunately, millions of innocent people had to pay the price of the smartness of Muhammad through their blood. </p>]]></description>

			<title>Brutal Wife BEATING in Islam (Recommendation VS Actual Law)</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><!--StartFragment --></p>
<h2 data-sourcepos="3:1-3:63">Summary </h2>
<p>Islamic preachers claim:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wife beating is not allowed in Islam under any circumstances, except in cases of disloyalty.</li>
<li>Husbands cannot beat their wives directly. They must follow a three-step process:
<ul>
<li>First, offer advice to the wife.</li>
<li>Second, separate their beds.</li>
<li>Only in the third and final step are they allowed to beat their wives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moreover, this beating must be very mild (e.g., using a Miswak, a small tooth-cleaning stick about 6 inches long).</li>
</ol>
<p>Islamic preachers use the following verse as their proof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:63">Quran <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/4/34/default.htm">4:34</a>:</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:63"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">ٱلرِّجَالُ قَوَّٰمُونَ عَلَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَآ أَنفَقُوا۟ مِنْ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ ۚ فَٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتُ قَٰنِتَٰتٌ حَٰفِظَٰتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ ٱللَّهُ ۚ وَٱلَّٰتِى تَخَافُونَ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>نُشُوزَهُنَّ </strong></span>فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَٱهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِى ٱلْمَضَاجِعِ وَٱضْرِبُوهُنَّ ۖ فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا۟ عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا</span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:63"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">(Dishonest Translation by Islamic Preaches): </span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:63"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>disloyalty</strong></span></span>- <span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="color: #1200ff;"><strong>[first]</strong></span> advise them; <span style="color: #1200ff;"><strong>[then if they persist]</strong></span>, forsake them in bed; and <span style="color: #1200ff;"><strong>[finally]</strong></span>, <span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 18px;"><strong>beat them</strong></span> <span style="color: #1200ff;"><strong>[lightly]</strong></span>. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But all these claims by Islamic apologists are false and nothing more than lies they fabricated themselves. They were caught red-handed while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad was considered the best person (according to Islam) to understand the verses of the Quran.</li>
<li>Muhammad never interpreted this verse in the way modern Islamic apologists do.</li>
<li>Muhammad permitted his male companions to beat their wives brutally, even causing bruises all over their bodies. 'Aisha testified in Sahih Bukhari that the male companions of Muhammad beat their wives more brutally than Kafir men.</li>
<li>Muhammad also allowed his male companions to slap their wives.</li>
<li>Muhammad allowed his companions to beat their wives in every matter of life under the guise of discipline.</li>
<li>Some of Muhammad's male companions became notorious for their wife-beating.</li>
<li>Muhammad did not grant women the right to divorce if their abusive husbands beat them. Only if a bone or another part of their body was broken did Muhammad permit Khul' (خلع), which still required the woman to pay additional ransom money to her abusive husband to obtain a divorce.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how Muhammad himself understood the verse on beating wives. Islamic apologists have no grounds to challenge Muhammad's interpretation of this verse.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is crucial to distinguish between these two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>What Muhammad recommended (i.e., not to beat wives severely or to slap them on the face).</li>
<li>What Muhammad stipulated as law (i.e., even if a man beats her severely, leaving bruises all over her body, this is still legally permissible with no punishment for the man. Similarly, if he slaps her in the face, she has no recourse against this abuse. She cannot obtain a divorce due to such treatment, nor seek any form of retribution; she must endure this abuse for the rest of her life according to Sharia law).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Muhammad's Strategy:</span></strong></p>
<p>Muhammad was a shrewd politician. He aimed to avoid alienating Muslim women. When women approached him with complaints about being beaten, he issued ruling in their favor (i.e. prohibiting husbands to beat their wives or to slap them in the face). However, Muhammad also sought the support of men, who were crucial for warfare and obtaining war booty.</p>
<p>Thus, Muhammad employed the following tactics to balance the interests of both groups:</p>
<p>- Firstly, when women approached him, he provided a ruling in their favor.<br>- But later, when his male companions came to him, Muhammad claimed that Allah revealed new verses abrogating the earlier ruling, thus allowing men to beat and slap their wives.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId855551"></a><span>Upon </span><strong>what</strong><span> matters is a man allowed to beat his wife in Islam?</span></h2>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:6"><span>Please read this Fatwa (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321030017/http://www.onlinefatawa.com/fatawa/view_scn/19775">link</a>),</span><span> which outlines the </span><strong>original teachings</strong><span> of Islam and clarifies that a husband </span><strong>can</strong><span> beat his wife under the following circumstances:</span></p>
<ul data-sourcepos="7:1-8:71">
<li data-sourcepos="7:1-7:68"><strong>If</strong><span> she does not provide sexual services to him wholeheartedly.</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="8:1-8:71"><strong>If</strong><span> she does not make herself attractive for him (e.</span><span>g.,</span><span> by wearing jewelry,</span><span> using perfumes,</span><span> or bathing to arouse his interest).</span></li>

<p data-sourcepos="14:1-14:287"><span>In general,</span><span> Sharia Law permits a husband to beat his wife for any reason he deems fit </span><strong>if</strong><span> she is not conforming to his wishes (similar to the treatment of slaves,</span><span> as a wife is </span><strong>expected</strong><span> to follow her husband's desires in Islam).</span><span> This will become clearer as you review the Ahadith (traditions) and see how the male companions of Muhammad </span><strong>behaved</strong><span> towards their wives.</span></p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId810849"></a>Background: How Did Brutal Beating of Wives Become Part of Islamic Sharia?</h2>
<p>Human reason tells us that divine revelations should embody ‘justice’.</p>
<p>However, no divine entity exists in the heavens; rather, it was Muhammad who crafted these revelations according to his political ambitions. Thus, we observe not divine justice, but the ‘human errors’ of Muhammad and his ‘political motives’ in these revelations.</p>
<p>Initially, Muhammad understood that he needed women’s support to propagate his new religion. Therefore, when women came to him with complaints about their husbands beating them, he initially prohibited such actions entirely. This led to women becoming more assertive and resisting abuse, which angered men significantly.</p>
<p>Realizing that incurring men’s anger was more dangerous to his fledgling religion than angering women, Muhammad reversed his stance and allowed men to beat their wives. Moreover, Muhammad closed all avenues for women to escape from abusive husbands through divorce or any other means.</p>
<p>It is crucial to understand that divine revelation should not be subject to a ‘trial and error’ approach, where divine commands are altered under the guise of Naskh (abrogation) to suit Muhammad’s political goals. True divine revelation should ensure justice and protection for women from the outset.</p>
<p>The following Hadiths illustrate the trial-and-error approach of Muhammad’s revelations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2146">Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2146</a>:</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah (initially) said: Do not beat Allah's handmaidens (i.e. the women). But then Umar came to the Messenger of Allah and said: Women have become emboldened towards their husbands (i.e. they don’t let their husbands beat them). Upon that, <strong>he (the Prophet) gave permission (to the husbands) to beat them</strong>. Then <strong>many women</strong> came round the family of the Messenger of Allah complaining against (the beating of) their husbands. So, the Messenger of Allah said: Many women have gone round Muhammad's family complaining against their husbands. They (i.e. these men) are not the best among you.</p>
<p>Grade: <strong>Sahih </strong>(Albani)</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1985">Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 1985</a>:</p>
<p>"The Prophet said: 'Do not beat the female slaves of Allah (i.e. women).' Then 'Umar came to the Prophet and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the women have become bold towards their husbands? So, order the beating of them,' and they were beaten. Then many women went around to the family of Muhammad. The <strong>next day</strong> he said: 'Last night <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>seventy women</strong> </span>came to the family of Muhammad, each woman complaining about her husband. You will not find that those (men) are the best of you.' "</p>
<p>Grade: <strong>Sahih </strong>(Darussalam)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, male companions became emboldened and began beating their wives severely in all matters. Muhammad’s recommendation (that such husbands are not the best among you) failed to deter them as it was merely a “recommendation” and not legally binding. Practically, Sharia Law permitted severe beatings, with no legal repercussions for men. Women were also unable to escape abusive marriages through divorce or other means, as Muhammad had blocked those avenues through Sharia law.</p>
<h2>Muslim Demand: Muhammad should be "PRAISED" for this recommendation:</h2>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>How much credit does Muhammad deserve for merely recommending that men who beat their wives are not good human beings?</p>
<p>All societies have some form of moral code to protect women. In fact, the so-called Kuffar from the so-called era of IGNORANCE had better morals in protecting their women from being beaten by men. You will read 'Aisha's testimony later, where she states that Muslim women were beaten more brutally by their husbands than non-Muslim women were by their Kafir husbands.</p>
<p>Moreover, Muhammad's recommendation also had a political angle. Seventy women were already on the verge of rebellion against him due to being beaten. If Muhammad hadn't responded, he would have lost the political support of women entirely. Even the protest of these 70 women wasn't enough to prompt an immediate response; it took Muhammad another 24 hours (until the next day) to issue this small recommendation. It seems that Muhammad's wives and other women later supported this initial rebellion, as mentioned in another Hadith you'll read later, which tells how Muslim women used to support each other against their abusive husbands. This forced Muhammad to make the small recommendation after 24 hours.</p>
<p>After this inconsistent policy by Muhammad, things escalated to the point where some of Muhammad's male companions even became notorious for beating their wives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1480q">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1480q</a>:</p>
<p>وَأَبُو الْجَهْمِ مِنْهُ شِدَّةٌ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ - أَوْ يَضْرِبُ النِّسَاءَ أَوْ نَحْوَ هَذَا - وَلَكِنْ عَلَيْكِ بِأُسَامَةَ بْنِ زَيْدٍ ‏"‏ ‏.‏</p>
<p>(The Prophet told a woman Fatima bint Qais): …  <strong>Abu'l-Jahm is very harsh with women, or he beats women, or like that</strong> (so she should not marry him).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most nutorious companion for beating his wife was Zubayr Ibn al-Awwam (who was among the Top Ten highly-ranked Companions). We will read about him and the brutal torture of all of his wives later in this article. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId280156"></a>Sharia Law Ruling: People should neither interfere nor question a husband when he is beating his wife.</h2>
<p>Additionally, Muhammad declared that people should not stop a husband from beating his wife, nor should they ask him why he is doing so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1986">Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 1986</a>:<br>It was narrated that Ash'ath bin Qais said: "I was a guest (at the home) of 'Umar one night, and in the middle of the night he went and hit his wife, and I separated them. When he went to bed, he said to me: 'O Ash'ath, learn from me something that I heard from the Messenger of Allah" A man should not be asked (from other people) why he is beating his wife (i.e. he made a mistake by stopping Umar from beating his wife).<br>Darussalam graded this Hadith to be “Hasan” (i.e. Good). <br>Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani declared it to be “Sahih” (i.e. Authentic). "والحديث صحيح كما قاله ابن حجر في "تنبيه الأخيار" الفتوحات الربانية 7/140."

</blockquote>
<p>Islamic apologists decieve people by telling them that Islam allows to beat their wives only lightly with tooth-cleaning twig (i.e. Miswak). Please see how Umar Ibn Khattab was not beating his wife with the tooth-cleaning twig, but it was a brutal beating, and another person had to forcefully separate Umar from his wife. </p>
<p>Ibn Qaddamah wrote about this hadith (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180404050107/http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1005_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%AC-%D9%A8/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_165">link</a>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>لأنه قد يضربها لأجل الفراش – أي: امتناعها عن الجماع -، فإن أخبر بذلك استحيا، وإن أخبر بغيره كذب</p>
<p>(Other people should not ask a man why he beats his wife, while) it is possible that he beats her upon her refusal to do sex with him. And that man may feel ashamed to tell the real reason for the beating, so if he tells something else then it would be a lie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Imam al-Nawawi wrote under this hadith (<a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://library.tebyan.net/fa/Viewer/Text/108554/343">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" فصل: يكره أن يُسأل الرجل: فيم ضرب امرأته من غير حاجة: قد روينا في أول هذا الكتاب في " حفظ اللسان " والأحاديث الصحيحة في السكوت عما لا تظهر فيه المصلحة، وذكرنا الحديث الصحيح: ( من حسن إسلام المرء تركه ما لا يعنيه ) "</p>
<p>It is detestable to ask a man why he is beating his wife, if it is not needed. We have collected the traditions about “Hifz Lisan” in the beginning of the book, which tell us to stay silent if the reason for anything is not apparent to us. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This represents the height of cruelty against women. Muhammad not only permitted the beating of a wife but also prohibited others from intervening or even shaming the husband for it. People were not even allowed to ask why he was beating her.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Taliban_beating_woman_in_public_RAWA.jpg" alt="Sharia Law Ruling: People should neither interfere and stop the husband when he is beating his wives nor ask him why he is beating them" width="376" height="274" class="float-end" style="font-size: 1rem;"></p>
<p>This means that when this Talib (a member of the Taliban in Afghanistan) in the above photo was beating his wives, no one was permitted to interfere or question him about the reasons for the beating.</p>
<p>Additionally, modern Islamic preachers claim that the Quran states a beating is only permissible if a wife is "disloyal" and invites another man into the house. However, as seen above, a wife can be beaten for refusing to provide sex services. The 70 female companions, who were beaten by their husbands and were on the verge of rebellion against Muhammad were not "disloyal" and did not invite other men into their homes. Instead, they were beaten because Islam generally permits husbands to beat their wives for every matter.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> </p>
<p>Although Islamic scholars have declared this tradition to be authentic, some Islamic preachers argue that Sheikh Albani of Saudi Arabia considered it weak.</p>
<p>We respond to these preachers by pointing out that human rationale clearly reveals the contradictions within your Ilm-ul-Hadith (Science of Hadith). This field, which you created yourself later, it was only designed to manipulate the truth, allowing you to arbitrarily declare any tradition as authentic or weak to protect the honor of your religion.</p>
<p>Not only have other Islamic scholars affirmed its authenticity (in contrast to Albani's view), but additional traditions in your own books also testify that Muslim men could beat their wives like animals and still compel them to provide sex services afterward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6042">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6042</a>:</p>
<p>The Prophet said, "How does anyone of you beat his wife as he beats the stallion camel and then he may embrace (sleep with) her?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-7/Book-62/Hadith-132/">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5204</a>:</p>
<p>The Prophet said, "None of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that Muhammad was aware that his companions were beating their wives like animals and slaves, then compelling them to sleep with them later in the day. Despite this knowledge, he did not prohibit this behavior through any Sharia Law ruling. At most, he issued an “(empty) recommendation” not to do it. However, this recommendation was not binding on the husbands, and women were unable to gain freedom from such abusive Muslim husbands through Islamic courts or divorce/Khul'.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId179330"></a>Aisha witnessed that the male companions used to beat their wives far more brutally than even the Kuffar husbands</h2>
<p>The following Hadith in Sahih Bukhari describes a woman who was forced to undergo the Islamic practice of "Halala." Her first husband divorced her, but they later wanted to reunite. However, Islam requires a divorced woman to marry another man and then be divorced by him before she can return to her first husband.</p>
<p>The second husband, unwilling to divorce her and give her freedom, compelled her to provide him with sex services by beating her so brutally that she was bruised. Despite this severe abuse, she had no means to escape and regain her freedom.</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5825/">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5825:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rifa`a divorced his wife whereupon `AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. `Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her <strong>a green spot</strong> (bruise) on her skin caused by severe beating).<strong> It was the habit of ladies to support each other</strong>, so when Allah's Apostle came, <strong>`Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women (i.e. even the non-Muslim men don't beat their non-believing women so brutally)</strong>.<strong> Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!</strong>" When `AbdurRahman heard that his wife had gone to the Prophet, he came with his two sons from another wife. She said, "By Allah! I have done no wrong to him but he is impotent and is as useless to me as this," holding and showing the fringe of her garment, `Abdur-Rahman said, "By Allah, O Allah's Apostle! She has told a lie! I am very strong and can satisfy her but she is disobedient and wants to go back to Rifa`a (i.e. the first husband)." Allah's Apostle said, to her, "If that is your intention, then know that it is unlawful for you to remarry Rifa`a unless `Abdur-Rahman has had sexual intercourse with you." Then the Prophet saw two boys with `Abdur- Rahman and asked (him), "Are these your sons?" On that `AbdurRahman said, "Yes." The Prophet said, "You claim what you claim (i.e. that he is impotent)? But by Allah, these boys resemble him as a crow resembles a crow,"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tradition serves as evidence that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if a woman does not love her husband, the husband can still beat her brutally to force her to provide sex services with complete compliance. </li>
<li>'Aisha herself testifies that Muslim men used to beat their wives with far greater cruelty than non-Muslims (whom Muslims label as Kuffar from the Time of Ignorance).</li>
<li>This tradition also exposes the lies and deceptions surrounding the claim that Islam permits only light beating of women. In reality, Sharia Law permits severe beating of wives, with the "light beating" merely being a “recommendation.”</li>
<li>Muhammad's recommendation for light beating proved to be "empty" and had so little impact that even Muhammad's companions (the so-called best generation of Muslims) disregarded it, continuing to beat their wives far more brutally than non-Muslims. If Muhammad's companions ignored his recommendation, how can we expect today’s ignorant Mullahs and Muslims to heed it and spare their wives from brutal beatings?</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it possible that, despite this torture of wives by Muslim men, any rational person could believe that Islam provided women with their rights and justice?</p>
<p>The TRUTH is, Islam did not provide protection for vulnerable women. It is only the secular, non-religious West that has ensured women’s rights to justice and protection from abuse and beating by their husbands.</p>
<p>And what to talk about the non-religious West today, even the so-called Kuffar society from the Time of Ignorance demonstrated better morals than Muhammad in protecting women from beatings and torture by their husbands.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Excuse by Islamic Apologists:</strong></span></p>
<p>An Islamic apologist claimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The incident of the woman being beaten was an "exceptional case" because she used to provoke her second husband to force him to divorce her. That’s why the Prophet did not object to the severe beating from the second husband. For other women, husbands are only permitted to administer light beatings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This excuse lacks credibility.</p>
<p>The testimony of 'Aisha, as presented in the same tradition, shows that not only was this woman beaten by her second husband, but, in general, the Sahaba (male companions) were inflicting such severe beatings on women that even the Kuffar did not treat their women so brutally. Furthermore, another hadith recounts that 70 female companions gathered around Muhammad's house, complaining about being beaten severely by their Muslim husbands. Additionally, Muhammad himself acknowledged that men were beating their wives like animals and slaves, and then compelling them to provide sex services later that same night.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId809251"></a>If a husband breaks any part of her body, she still does not automatically gain the right to a divorce; instead, she must pay a ransom for her freedom</h2>
<p>A woman cannot  gain her freedom, even if she suffers bruises from severe beating by her husband. </p>
<p>But if the beating was so severe that it broke any part of her body, then she gets a chance to ger her freedom from such an abusive husband. Howoever, this seperation also does not happen automatically, but she must pay a <strong>ransom money</strong> to her husband,  known as ‘Khul’ (خلع) in Islam, to secure her freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2228">Sunnan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2228</a>:</p>
<p>Narrated Aisha: Habibah daughter of Sahl was the wife of Thabit ibn Qays Shimmas He beat her and broke some of her part. So she came to the Prophet after morning, and complained to him against her husband. The Prophet called on Thabit ibn Qays and said (to him): Take a part of her property and separate yourself from her. He asked: Is that right, Messenger of Allah? He said: Yes. He said: I have given her two gardens of mine as a dower, and they are already in her possession. The Prophet said: Take them and separate yourself from her.<br>Albani declared this Hadith to be authentic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please see how helpless a woman is in Islam: despite enduring brutal beating, she must still pay a ransom to escape an abusive husband.</p>
<p>Had this unfortunate female companion of Muhammad lived in a modern secular Western society, she would have:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">- Automatically obtained the right to a divorce,<br>- Received compensation for the pain and suffering inflicted upon her,<br>- And the abuser would have faced imprisonment for physically harming her.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId611226"></a>Slapping the Face of a Wife in Islam</h2>
<p>Islamic preachers often propagate that Islam forbids slapping a wife on the face. However, they often conceal the complete truth. While it is recommended not to slap the face, Sharia Law still permits husbands to do so. Women are neither able to retaliate against it nor obtain a divorce solely for being slapped on the face.</p>
<p>Islamic preachers mislead people by presenting only the hadith about the "recommendation," which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2142">Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2142</a>:</p>
<p>Mu'awiyah asked: Messenger of Allah, what is the right of the wife of one of us over him? He replied: That you should give her food when you eat, clothe her when you clothe yourself, <strong>do not strike her on the face</strong>, do not revile her or separate yourself from her except in the house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, it is important to note that Islam allows husbands to revile their wives (along with beating them), but it does not permit wives to revile their husbands in the name of "respect." This tradition highlights these double standards.</p>
<p>Secondly, despite the recommendation against it, Islamic Sharia Law still permits men to slap their wives on the face without any punishment. Moreover, women do not have the right to seek freedom from their husbands due to this abuse.</p>
<p>Islamic preachers often mislead people by concealing the truth, which is:</p>
<ul>
<li>INITIALLY Muhammad forbade to slap on the face of wives. </li>
<li>However, later Muhammad claimed that Allah allowed husbands to also slap their wives on their faces, and the verse 4:34 was revealed for this permission. </li>
</ul>
<p>All Muslim Mufassirin (Commentators of the Quran) like Ibn Kathir, Qurtabi, Ibn Jarir etc. recorded it under the commentary of verse 4:34</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Imam Suyuti also recorded from Zuhri, who clarified that, except in cases where the wife loses her life due to beating, no Qasas (retaliatory punishment) can be taken from the husband for other forms of beating, such as slapping, bruises or broken bones. Islam granted these "one-sided" rights of torture and brutal beating to husbands in the name of teaching the so-called "respect" to their wives (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;tSoraNo=4&amp;tAyahNo=34&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>وأخرج ابن جرير وابن المنذر عن الزهري قال: لا تقص المرأة من زوجها إلا في النفس</p>
<p>Zuhri said: There is no Qasas (retaliation in the form of eye for an eye) for a wife, except in case she loses her life (due to beating).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Muhammad could never allow any punishment for husbands under Qasas (retaliation), as he needed the support of men for wars, which aligned with his political motives. At the same time, he didn't want to anger the women, as that would also conflict with his political agenda. Thus, he made a revelation on the spot that prohibited any punishment for husbands. He appeased the women by telling them that he personally wished to punish the husbands under Qasas, but Allah did not permit it. Revelation was an ultimate weapon in Muhammad's hands, through which he easily achieved all his political and personal goals.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId125268"></a>Wives are like "slaves and prisoners" in the hands of their husbands</h2>
<p>Remember the Hadith from Bukhari (quoted above), which describes how male companions beat their wives like slaves and stallion camels? Here is another tradition where Muhammad explicitly claims that wives are indeed like "prisoners" in the hands of their husbands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1851">Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 1851</a>:</p>
<p>... Then he (the prophet) said: 'I enjoin good treatment of women,<strong> for they are prisoners with you</strong>, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark ...</p>
<p>Grade: Sahih (authentic)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, Umar Ibn Khattab said that Marriage is slavery, so be careful about whom you give your daughter for enslavement (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151225002410/http://fahmalhadeeth.com/the-athar-that-says-marriage-is-enslavement/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the exact reality of Islam, where Muhammad considered wives as "prisoners/slaves." They don't have their own free will but must follow the wishes of their husbands, having no control over their bodies, which are also controlled by their husbands.</p>
<p>Of course, all societies have morals where they recommend treating prisoners and slaves well, but such recommendations do not change the original status of prisoners and slaves. The same is true for women in Islam. They are like prisoners of their husbands, and despite some recommendations from Muhammad to treat them well, it does not change their original status as prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong></p>
<p>A wife is like a "prisoner," but even worse is the fact that children are considered the "property" of the father in Islam. Therefore, even if a Muslim father kills his son or daughter, he will not face the death penalty under Qasas (<a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/islam-general/children-are-property-and-no-punishment-for-fathers-for-killing-them">link</a>). Similarly, a slave is also the "property" of the Muslim owner, and this owner will not be killed in Qasas if he kills his slave (<a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/irreligion-atheism-agnosticism-deism-secularism/76">link</a>). </p>

<p>One of Zubayr's wives was Umm Kulthum, who had to trick him to get the divorce (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_Kulthum_bint_Uqba">link</a>):</p>

She asked him for a divorce, but he refused. So "she pestered him while he was doing <i>wudu</i> for the prayer, and he divorced her with a single divorce. Then she left." Zubayr afterwards complained, "She tricked me, may Allah trick her!" Prophet Muhammad advised him to "propose to her again," but Zubayr knew that Umm Kulthum probably might not return to him (Reference: Muhammad ibn Saad. <i>Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir</i> vol. 8.

<h2>A husband is even allowed to beat his wife with a Rope or a Whip</h2>
<p>According to Imam Malik, a husband is even allowed to beat his wife with a rope or a whip, till the time he does not break any part of her body. However, if he unintentionally breaks any part of her body, no retaliation would be made against the husband. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/416530">Muwatta Imam Malik, Book 43, Hadith 15</a>:</p>
<p>Malik said, "When a man intentionally goes to his wife and gouges out her eye or breaks her hand or cuts off her finger or such like, and does it intentionally, retaliation is inflicted on him. <strong>As for a man who strikes his wife with a rope or a whip and hits what he did not mean to hit or does what he did not intend to do, he pays blood-money for what he has struck according to this principle, and retaliation is not inflicted on him.</strong>"</p>

There are, for instance, multiple hadiths in which Muhammad's companions beat or strike women (sometimes in his presence), as well as some, albeit conflicting evidence narrated from his wife, Aisha, regarding whether Muhammad himself used physical force against the women in his life. The best examples, perhaps, of hadiths permitting wife-beating are those in which Muhammad explicitly attempts to<span> </span><i>moderate</i><span> </span>wife-beating while nonetheless permitting it, as these have frequently been cited by dissenting modern voices and apologists themselves.</p>

He took hold of his mantle slowly and put on the shoes slowly, and opened the door and went out and then closed it lightly. I covered my head, put on my veil and tightened my waist wrapper, and then went out following his steps till he reached Baqi'. He stood there and he stood for a long time. He then lifted his hands three times, and then returned and I also returned. He hastened his steps and I also hastened my steps. He ran and I too ran.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId303542"></a>Muslim Apologists: The Quran allows beating a wife only if she becomes disloyal</h2>
<p>Modern Islamic apologists deny that Islam allows husbands to beat their wives. Regarding the verse 4:34, they DISTORT the translation, and come up with these claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>The verse 4:34 is not applicable in general cases of "disobedience", but ONLY in the case if a wife becomes "<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>Disloyal</strong></span>". </li>
<li>And the verse 4:34 does not ask to "beat" them, but to "<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>separate from them</strong></span>". </li>
</ol>
<p> One of them presented the following excuse (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/tp9844/comment/i2a2zj0/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Many Muslims translate the word “idribuhunna” (which is the command form of “daraba”) as “beat them”. But that is not the right meaning of the word.<br>The verse says:<br><em>[4:34] “Men are the maintainers of women by means of what God has favored some over the others, and through what they spend of their money. The righteous women accept this willingly and they guard the secrets as God has guarded it. As for the women from whom you fear <strong>‘nushuz' (<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">disloyalty</span>)</strong>, you shall advise them, desert them in bed and <strong>‘idribuhunna' (<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">separate from them</span>)</strong>.”...</em><br>Bearing this in mind, we must look at the multiple meanings for the word “daraba” in the Quran and see what fits:<br>The meanings for “daraba” as found in the Quran: To go out or travel (3:156, 4:101), strike or beat (2:60-61, 3:112, 47:4), to present an example (43:57, 30:28, 13:17), to withdraw or separate (43:5), to seal or cover (18:11), to draw over (24:31), to attribute (43:17), to establish (57:13).<br>Verse 4:34 talks about what happens in the case of a wife’s disloyalty towards her husband. The only two that would fit and make sense semantically in this case would be to beat them, or to separate from them. But aggression is forbidden in 2:190 and 5:87, so beating is cancelled, therefore it cannot mean to beat them.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, Muslim apologists have no chance to deceive people and translate "nashuz" as "disloyalty", but it means 'ill-treatment'. </p>

<p>"The Prophet said: 'Do not beat the female slaves of Allah.' Then 'Umar came to the Prophet and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the women have become bold towards their husbands? So, order the beating of them,' and they were beaten. Then many women went around to the family of Muhammad.

<p>Grade: <strong>Sahih </strong>(Darussalam)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, those seventy women (i.e. female companions of Muhammad) were not "disloyal" to their husbands and they were not involved in adultery. But Muhammad allowed his male companions to beat them in every matter.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a challenge to Islamic preachers to refute the understanding of their Prophet, who never understood that beating wives is allowed only if they become disloyal. </p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Nevertheless, Muhammad was cunning and he "ABROGATED" that condition of Justice ('ADL عدل) later in this verse 4.129, by telling men that they don't have the "ability" to do Justice (i.e. ADL تَعْدِلُوا۟) between their wives, and thus they could demand their wives to give up some of their rights in name of "settlement".</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This then became a license in the hands of husbands to blackmail their wives and to compel them to dance according to the wishes of their husbands.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad himself threatened old lady Hafsa from giving her DIVORCE 'without' any reason. Poor old Hafsa didn't know what to do and where to go after divorce in that old age.

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId692040"></a>The Deadly Combination: Woman’s beating + A Woman not having the right to divorce</h3>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:311">We cannot understand the real misery of a woman until we look at things from the right perspective. This right perspective is the study of the deadly combination of a woman's beating and the fact that she does not have the right to get her freedom through a divorce, through a court, or through any other means.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:83">In Islam, a woman can get her freedom from her husband in the following three ways:</p>
<ol data-sourcepos="9:1-14:0">
<li data-sourcepos="9:1-9:166">
<p><strong>Divorce:</strong> A woman does not have the right to initiate a divorce in Islam. Therefore, if her husband is beating her, she cannot get her freedom through a divorce.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="10:1-11:235">
<p><strong>Khul' (خلع):</strong> There is a common misconception (due to the false propaganda of Islamic preachers) that Islam gives women the right to initiate a divorce through khul'. However, this is not the case. In the real Islamic khul', a woman has to bribe her husband and offer him "ransom money". If he accepts the money, then he divorces her. However, if he refuses to accept the money, no one (including an Islamic court) can force him to divorce her. In simple terms, khul' is not a right of a woman in Islam. It is also a right of the husband only. If he beats her and also refuses to accept the ransom money, she will not be able to get her freedom through khul' in any Islamic court. <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Note:</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Due to women's rights movements, some Islamic countries rejected the real Sharia law of Khul', and they indeed made laws which give the right to the woman to take divorce from their husbands through courts (but this is not what actual Islamic Khul' is). </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Please read our article for more details: </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/component/content/article/the-pharaoh-s-mummy-uncovering-deceptions-and-falsehoods?catid=10">Khul’ is not the “right” of a woman, but it is still the “right” of a husband to either grant it or deny it</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></p>

<p><strong>Faskh-e-Nikah (i.e. dissolution of marriage through an Islamic Court):</strong> In this case, the Islamic court can separate the woman from her husband. However, this is limited to only some special cases (such as if the husband is impotent or if he is not providing food and clothing for his wife, or his whereabouts are not known. Please read the details of these few exceptional cases <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/component/content/article/the-pharaoh-s-mummy-uncovering-deceptions-and-falsehoods?catid=10">here</a>. In the case of beating the wife (even with bruises), an Islamic court cannot grant a woman freedom from her husband through faskh. The only way that a wife can get her freedom from an abusive husband is if he breaks any part of her body. In this case, the wife will not automatically get a divorce, but she will have to pay the "ransom money" to her husband so that he will grant her freedom by divorcing her.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId749997"></a><strong>Summary:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad killed Safiyyah's brother, husband, and other male relatives during the daytime and then had sexual relations with her (most probably the next night)</li>
<li>He also tortured her husband before killing him.</li>
<li>Previously, Safiyyah's tribe resided in Medina. However, Muhammad expelled her tribe from Medina. They later settled in Khaibar but were subsequently attacked again by Muhammad.</li>
<li>Safiyyah's father had also been priviously slaughtered by Muhammad during the incident of Banu Qurayzah.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raping a captive woman is a cruel act, but to do so on the same night when she is in a state of trauma from the loss of her relatives is the height of cruelty. Muslims regard Muhammad as a mercy to all mankind, but his actions toward Safiyyah contradict this claim. Some Muslims justify Muhammad's behavior by suggesting that Safiyyah willingly engaged in intercourse with him just after killing of her male relativers because she had dreamt of him before and was not in shock or grief over the loss of her relatives. However, this explanation is flawed. Safiyyah, as a human being with emotions and agency, would have found it highly unlikely to willingly engage in intimate relations with someone just after he had killed her brother, husband and other male relatives.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId152353"></a>Not only Safiyyah, but indeed Muhammad is RESPONSIBLE when Muslim Jihadists raped millions of captive women on the very first night after killing their relatives</h2>
<p><strong>Muslim Excuse:</strong> Safiyyah had already dreamt about the Prophet. So, it was not a shock for her to have sex with him on the same night when her brother/husband and other male relatives were killed.</p>
<p><strong>Our Response:</strong> But Islam allowed the rape of all women on the very night and <strong>those women had never dreamt about their Jihadists rapists</strong> who killed their male relatives the same day.</p>
<p>In Islamic Sharia, it is allowed to rape the captive women of the war by making them slaves. This rape of captive women in Sharia is an abuse of humanity. But not even letting them mourn the dead bodies of their fathers/brothers/husbands/sons, and raping them in this state of shock and trauma, it is simply the peak of abuse of humanity. </p>
<p>If the captives were virgin girls (or minor girls who have yet not menstruated), then Muslims were allowed to rape them the same night, even with penetration in their vaginas. But if the captive women had husbands, then Muslims were not allowed to penetrate their vaginas, but they were allowed to drive all other kinds of sexual pleasures the same night, such as kissing them, making them naked and enjoying their whole body (except for vagina), compelling them to masturbate them, rubbing their penis in their thighs, etc. </p>
<p>Imam Bukhari writes in his Sahih Bukhari (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221101104834/https://shamela.ws/book/16684/2022">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>باب هل يسافر بالجارية قبل أن يستبرئها ولم ير الحسن بأسا أن يقبلها أو يباشرها وقال ابن عمر رضي الله عنهما إذا وهبت الوليدة التي توطأ أو بيعت أو عتقت فليستبرأ رحمها بحيضة ولا تستبرأ العذراء وقال عطاء لا بأس أن يصيب من جاريته الحامل ما دون الفرج وقال الله تعالى إلا على أزواجهم أو ما ملكت أيمانهم</p>
<p><strong>Chapte:</strong> Is it permissible for a man to travel with his slave-girl before he has had sexual intercourse with her?</p>
<p><strong>Al-Hasan did not see anything wrong with his kissing or engaging in foreplay with her.</strong> Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 'If a man gives a slave-girl who has already menstruated as a gift, sold her, or freed her, he should wait until she has purified herself from her menses before having sexual intercourse with her.<strong> As for a virgin, she does not need to wait until she has purified herself</strong>.' Ata' said: '<strong>There is nothing wrong with a man driving sexual pleasure with his pregnant slave-girl as long as he does not penetrate her vagina</strong>.' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ali raped a minor captive girl on the same night when she was made captive after the war.</p>
<p><a href="https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2">Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Buraydah: <br>I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: "O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!" Ali replied: "Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, <em><strong>and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.</strong></em>" ...<br><strong>Grading: </strong>Classed <em>Sahih</em> by al-Arna'ut</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Istibra </em>is a period of sexual abstinence required till the first period of the captive girl is over. This is to ensure no confusion on paternity. Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any<em> Istibra</em>, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220109230613/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;ID=7846&amp;bk_no=52&amp;flag=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة</p>
<p>"There was a question about whether it was permissible for 'Ali to have sexual intercourse with a slave-girl without waiting for her to purify herself from her menses, as well as whether it is permissible to divide her among partners. As for the first issue,<strong> it is assumed that the slave-girl in question was a non-pubescent virgin, and it was believed that such a girl does not need to purify</strong> (i.e. Istibra) herself, and<em><strong> it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.</strong></em>" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Those millions of captive women didn't dream about their rapist Jihadists, why did then Islam let them be raped the same night?</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #843fa1;">Did those millions of captive women have any less human value than Safiyyah? </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #e67e23;">Or does Islam consider them only as animals, and thus their trauma and grieving do not count? </span></li>

<p>So, even if the Jews and Christians were able to feel the pain of those captive women thousands of years before Muhammad, why did then Muhammad was not able to see the pain of those poor captive women?</p>
<p>Look at the anguish and trauma experienced by women when their families are slaughtered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sachaai.com/images/safiyyah_slain_bodies.png">The History of al-Tabari, vol.8, page 122</a>:</p>
<p>Safiyyah bint Huyayy was brought to Messenger of God, and another woman with her. Bilal, who was the one who brought them, led them past some of the slain Jews. <strong>When the woman who was with Safiyyah saw them, she cried out, struck her face, and poured dust on her head. When the Messgner of God saw her, he siad, "Take this she-devil away from me!"</strong> .. he messenger of God said to Bilal ... <strong>"Are you devoid of mercy Bilal, that you take two women past their slain men?</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unfortunate that Muslim apologists still try to defend Islam by questioning the authenticity of this tradition. But we tell them that this tradition does not need any authenticity, while it is a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UNIVERSAL TRUTH</strong></span>. Our human intellect tells us whenever you slaughter the family of any woman, then she will always cry and strike her face, and pour dust on her head in grief and sorrow. So, why do you need to deny the authenticity of this narration, when it is only telling a Universal Truth? </p>
<p>And Muhammad is strange, on one side he was telling Bilal to show mercy on the woman who had just seen her slain relatives, but on the other hand, the same Muhammad let his Jihadist Sahaba rape and drive sexual pleasures from those poor women the same night, when they were in the state of trauma. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId397882"></a>Muhammad had sex with Safiyyah the next night after killing her male relatives</h2>
<p>Safiyyah was the daughter of a Jewish tribe leader. Prophet Muhammad killed her brother and husband in the battle of Khaybar, and then didn't even let her weep at their dead bodies, but distributed all the captive women on the same day as slave women among his companions. Previously, Muhammad had also slaughtered her father. </p>
<p>Safiyyah initially came in the possession of companion Dihya Al-Kalbi. Later, when companions described the "beauty" of Safiyah in front of Muhammad, then he gave<strong> 7 slave women</strong> to Dihya and got Safiyah for himself. </p>
<p>Sahih Muslim, Book of Marriage (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/16/102">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the battle of Khaiber, the companion Dihya got beautiful slave woman (i.e Safiyah).<strong> When Prophet Muhammad came to know about the beauty of Safiyah</strong>, then he took her for himself <strong>and gave 7 slave women to Dihya as exchange for Safiyah.</strong> Then he handed her to Um Salim so that she could prepare her as bride for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad most probably slept with her (most probably on the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>next night</strong></span>) after killing her male relatives. Muhammad desired to have intercourse with her just when they were just 6 miles away from Khaibar. But it finally happened in As-Sahbaa, which is 16 miles (i.e. one day march) away from Khaibar. <span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, Book of al-Maghazi (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2893">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Anas bin Malik: ...Then we reached Khaibar; and when Allah enabled him to conquer the Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was described to him. Her husband had been killed while she was a bride. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) selected her for himself and took her along with him till we reached a place called <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sa`d-AsSahba</strong></span>, <span style="color: #1200ff;"><strong>(which was one station from Khaibar)</strong></span>' where her menses were over and he took her for his wife.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Sa'd, al-Tabqat (<a href="https://hadith.islam-db.com/single-book/82/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%89-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%AF/44509/9991">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, conquered Khaybar and Allah granted him their wealth, he took Safiyya bint Huyayy and her cousin from al-Qamus as captives ...  and when they reached a place called Tibar, six miles from Khaybar, he intended to consummate the marriage with her, but she declined ... When they reached al-Sahba, a distance of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>one station</strong></span> from Khaybar, the Messenger of Allah told Umm Sulaym, "Take care of your companion and comb her hair." The Prophet intended to consummate the marriage there ...  and the Messenger of Allah consummated the marriage with her and spent the night with her</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please remember, a day before having sex with her, Muhammad killed the husband ad brother of Safiyah in the battle of Khaybar. Muhammad gave no time to Safiyah even to weep for them. </p>
<h2>Muhammad tortured Safiyyah's husband before killing him</h2>
<p>Before becoming the captive and wife of Muhammad, she was married to Kinana, the treasurer of the Banu Nadir, a Khaybar clan. Kinana was tortured and killed under Mohammed’s eyes to get him to confess where the treasure was hidden. Finally, part of the treasure was found and the rest remained untraceable. Muhammad delivered Kinana to Az-Zubair, saying, “Chasten him to the point of bringing forth what he hides.”</p>
<p>Az-Zubair burned Kinana’s chest with flint, leaving him almost dead. Kinana was finally put to death by another companion of the prophet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://archive.org/details/TheLifeOfMohammedGuillaume">Sirah of Ibn Hisham, page 764</a>:</strong></p>
<p>“Kinana ibn al-Rabi, who was the guardian of the treasure of the Banu al Nadir, was brought before the apostle who questioned him about it. He did not know where it was. A Jew arrived in front of the apostle and said that he had seen Kinana around a ruin every morning very early. The Apostle asked Kinana, “Do you know that if we find out that you have hidden it, we will kill you?” He replied, “Yes.” The apostle gave orders for the ruin to be searched and the treasure was found. Then asked where the rest of the treasure was but he refused to reveal it, so the apostle ordered al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwan: Torture him until he reveals  what he knows. Then he lit a fire with and witha flint and he burned his chest until he was almost dead. Then the apostle delivered him to Muhammad ibn Maslama, who cut off his head to avenge his brother Mahmud.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId242991"></a>Excuses by Islamic apologists</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists present this excuse:</p>
<p>Book "Tabqat-Ibne-Saad", 8/123:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>فقال: لها رسول الله: اختاري، فإن اخترت الإسلام أمسكتك لنفسي وإن اخترت اليهودية فعسى أن أعتقك فتلحقي بقومك. فقالت: يا رسول الله لقد هويت الإسلام وصدقت بك قبل أن تدعوني حيث صرت إلى رحلك وما لي في اليهودية أرب وما لي فيها والد ولا أخ، وخيرتني الكفر والإسلام فالله ورسوله أحب إلي من العتق وأن أرجع إلى قومي<br><br>... So, the Prophet said to her: ‘Make your choice, if you will choose Islam, I’ll select you for myself and if you chose Judaism, I’ll set you free and send you to your people.’ She said; ‘O Allah’s Messenger indeed I felt affection for Islam and testified for you even before you gave me this invitation when I came to you. I have no guardian among the Jews, neither father nor brother and I prefer Islam over disbelief. Allah and His Messenger are dear to me then freedom and to return to my people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Islamic apologists found it convenient to fabricate traditions to uphold the honor of their Prophet.</p>
<p>To understand how Islamic apologists fabricated traditions, please read the following two articles:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/component/content/article/131-ahadith-claim-ishaaq-was-sacrificed-vs-133-ahadith-claim-ismael-was-sacrificed?catid=23">The Hadith Fabrication Factory of Muslims: 131 Traditions claimed it was Ishaaq who was slaughtered, while 133 Traditions were fabricated that claimed it was Ismael who was slaughtered</a></li>

</ol>
<p>The tradition in Sahih Muslim starkly contradicts the account in Tabaqat, suggesting that Muhammad conditioned Safiyya's freedom upon marrying him rather than setting her free first. </p>
<p>Sahih Muslim, Book of Marriage (<a href="http://www.hadithurdu.com/02/2-2-1005/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's Apostle emancipated Safiyya, <strong>and her emancipation was treated as her wedding gift</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, Safiyya's emancipation was conferred as her bridal gift, indicating a simultaneous act of marriage and liberation. This contradicts the notion that Muhammad initially freed her and then proposed marriage. Additionally, it raises questions about the rationale behind Safiyya's emancipation. What distinguished her actions that prompted Muhammad to grant her freedom?</p>
<p>Evidently, Muhammad's actions suggest a different motivation, primarily driven by Safiyya's allure. His gift of seven slave women in exchange for her further underscores his fascination with her beauty. Thus, it appears Muhammad's intent was not solely focused on her emancipation and return to her Jewish roots, but rather on indulging in her beauty.</p>
<p>This pattern echoes in Muhammad's encounter with Juwayriyyah, daughter of the Banu al-Mustalq leader. Initially enslaved, Juwayriyyah sought assistance from Muhammad to secure her freedom. However, Muhammad's reaction to her beauty led him to propose a marriage offer as a condition for her emancipation.</p>
<p>Sunan Abi Dawud, The Book of Manumission of Slaves (<a href="https://www.sunnah.com/abudawud/31/6">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Juwayriyyah, daughter of al-Harith ibn al-Mustaliq, fell to the lot of Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammas, or to her cousin. She entered into an agreement to purchase her freedom. <u><b>She was a very beautiful woman, most attractive to the eye</b></u>. Aisha said: She then came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) asking him for the purchase of her freedom. When she was standing at the door, <u><b>I looked at her with disapproval. I realised that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) would look at her in the same way that I had looked</b></u>. She said: Apostle of Allah ... I have come to you to seek assistance for the purchase of my freedom. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Are you inclined to that which is better? She asked: What is that, Apostle of Allah? He replied: <u><b>I shall pay the price of your freedom on your behalf, and I shall marry you</b></u>. She said: I shall do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And lastly, this "authentic" tradition of Muslims itself tells us that Safiya considered Muhammad as the "most hated" and abhorred person for killing his father, brother and husband. </p>
<p> Sahih Ibn Habban (11/607) (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180606065643/https://dorar.net/h/8c0075f9b3f63d7f09bf41d3ccfabef1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>عن عبد الله بن عمر رضي الله عنه قال : ... قالت صفية :وكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم من أبغض الناس إليَّ قَتل زوجي وأبي وأخي فما زال يعتذر إليَّ ويقول : ( إن أباك ألَّب علي العرب وفعل وفعل ) حتى ذهب ذلك من نفسي .۔۔ رواه ابن حبان في " صحيحه " ( 11 / 607 ) ،  .</p>
<p>Abdullah Ibn Umar narrates that Safiya said:"Rasool Allah was among the most hated person for me, while he killed my husband, father and brother. Then he used to make excuses that my father used to incite the Arabs against him. He kept on apologizing for so long till I was no more angry. <br>Grading: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180606065643/https://dorar.net/h/8c0075f9b3f63d7f09bf41d3ccfabef1">Sahih (authentic)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tradition is itself a testimony that Safiya was angry upon Muhammad after the killing of his husband, father and brother and considered him the most hateful person, and if she slept with him the very same night, then it was only in order to save herself from the harm that Muhammad could have inflicted upon her as a slave woman. </p>
<p>According to the following tradition, at first, Safiyyah denied sleeping with Muhammad which even upset him. </p>
<p>Ibn Sa'd, al-Tabqat (<a href="https://hadith.islam-db.com/single-book/82/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%89-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%AF/44509/9991">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Safiyyah mounted the camel. The Prophet rode beside her and put a veil over her. They travelled with the Muslim army until they were six miles from Khaybar, the home of the enemy where the battle had taken place, where they stopped to rest. <strong>While they were resting, the Prophet wanted to consummate the marriage with her, but Safiyyah refused, which upset him</strong>. ... Reaching As-Sahbaa', which is one station from Khaybar, Safiyyah obeyed him (and let him sonsummate the marriage) ... He asked: "Why did you refuse during the first rest?" She replied, "O Messenger of Allah, I was afraid for you because the Jews were too near.” ( " مَا حَمَلَكِ عَلَى الَّذِي صَنَعْتِ حِينَ أَرَدْتُ أَنْ أَنْزِلَ الْمَنْزِلَ الأَوَّلَ فَأَدْخُلَ بِكِ ؟ " فَقَالَتْ : خَشِيتُ عَلَيْكَ قُرْبَ يَهُودَ)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, at first, Safiyyah denied sleeping with Muhammad. But later she got control of her anger in order to save herself from harm and agreed to sleep with Muhammad. And when Muhammad asked him why she had not slept with her previously, then she made an excuse that she feared the enemies. But we all know that enemies (i.e. the Jews) had already been defeated completely, and the Muslim army was going back, and Muhammad and his Army knew the strength of the enemies was ZERO, and they knew it much better than the young Safiyyah. Clearly, it was an excuse that Safiyyah had to make in order to save her from harm. </p>
<p>And now look at this tradition:</p>
<p>The History of al-Tabari, Volume XXXIX (39), p. 185:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn ‘Umar [al-Waqidi] – Kathir b. Zayd – al-Walid b. Rabah – Abu Hurayrah: While the Prophet was lying with Safiyyah, (the companion) Abu Ayyub stayed the night at his door. When he saw the Prophet in the morning he said "God is the Greatest." He had a sword with him; he said to the Prophet, "O Messenger of God, this young woman <u><b>had just been married, and you killed her father, her brother and her husband</b></u>, so I did not trust her (not to harm) you." The Prophet laughed and said "Good". </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is recorded in Sirah Ibn Hisham(<a href="https://archive.org/details/SirahIbnHishan/page/n514/mode/2up?q=safiyyah">Source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Ibn Ishaq says: When the Messenger of Allah [peace be upon him] consummated his marriage with Safiyyah [Allah be pleased with her] at Khaybar or at some point on the road from Khaybar, he spent the night with her in a dome-shaped tent. Throughout that entire night, Abu Ayyub: Khalid Ibn Zayd Al-Ansari stood guard outside the tent, girding his sword and went on going round the dome along the night. When the Messenger of Allah [peace be upon him] saw Abu Ayyub in the morning, he asked him: “What is the matter O Abu Ayyub?” He replied: “O Messenger of Allah, I feared that this woman may harm you; <strong>she is a woman whose father, husband and people were killed, and she has only embraced Islam recendy. I feared that she might try to harm you.</strong>” The Prophet [peace be upon him] supplicated for Abu Ayyub saying: “O Allah, protect Abu Ayyub just as he spent the night guarding me (1) .”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only were some of the companions troubled, but one of Muhammad's wives was also disturbed by the fact that a woman would want to marry her family's murderer. Such a response is fully natural:</p>
<p><i>The History of al-Tabari,</i> Volume VIII (8), p. 187:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to al-Waqidi: In this year the Messenger of God married Mulaykah bt. Dawud al-Laythiyyah. One of the Prophet's wives came to Mulaykah and said to her, "<u>Are you not ashamed to marry a man who killed your father?" She therefore "took refuge [in God]" from him</u>. She was beautiful and young. The Messenger of God separated from her. He had killed her father the day of the conquest of Mecca.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId271018"></a>Muslim Excuse 1: If only beauty was the reason, why did then Muhammad marry her and not enjoy her as a slave girl?</h2>
<p>The reason seems to be the beauty of Safiyyah, from which Muhammad was overpowered.</p>
<p>We know that Muhammad had multiple wives, which required a significant amount of time and space. Given that his house was small and located near the mosque, it was challenging for him to find private moments with his slave woman, Mariyah, without drawing criticism from his spouses. As a result, Muhammad struggled to spend intimate moments with Mariyah freely. When his wife Hafsa visited her father's home, Muhammad saw an opportunity and took it, engaging in sexual activity with Mariyah in Hafsa's quarters. Unfortunately, Hafsa returned unexpectedly, catching Muhammad and Mariyah together in a compromising position. This led to a major controversy, with the other wives joining Hafsa in protesting against Muhammad's actions. It went to the extent that Muhammad had to use the revelations in the name of Allah in order to threaten his wives. (<a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959">Sunan Nisai, Hadith 3959</a>)</p>
<p>Moreover, Safiyyah was a costly commodity for Muhammad, as he bought Safiyyah after giving away 7 slave women in exchange (Muhammad got those 7 slave women as war booty). Therefore, perhaps Muhammad didn't want such a costly commodity to become a slave and to stay dirty while doing work at home, but he wanted her to be free so that she remained beautiful and he could continue to enjoy her.</p>
<p>And as a slave girl, Safiyyah then had to go outside the home without a Hijab, with naked breasts, and then other Muslims would also have enjoyed her beauty (Note:<a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/women-and-hijab/islam-prohibited-hijab-for-slave-women-and-kept-their-breasts-naked"> Islam Prohibited Slave Women from Taking Hijab or Even Covering Their Naked Breasts in Public</a>).</p>
<p>Muslims claim that it was an old custom to marry the daughters of the defeated king so that the slaves of the defeated nation feel some relief. Yes, we do agree too that such custom existed, but it doesn't seem that Muhammad married Safiyyah/Juwariyyah to bring any relief to the slaves, but his sole purpose seems to be keeping these 2 beauties to himself. That is why in the case of Juwariyyah, he married her after a long time had already passed. And in the case of Safiyyah too, beauty seems to be the main factor while earlier he gave away Safiyyah to another companion Dihyaya, and he became interested in Safiyyah only when other Sahaba described her beauty to Muhammad. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId821612"></a>Muslim Excuse 2: Safiyyah dreamt of Muhammad even before the war</h2>
<p>Muslims also come up with this tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<div> نَزَلَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ خَيْبَرَ وَصَفِيَّةُ عَرُوسٌ فِي مَجَاسِدِهَا، فَرَأَتْ فِي الْمَنَامِ كَأَنَّ الشَّمْسَ نَزَلَتْ حَتَّى وَقَعَتْ عَلَى صَدْرِهَا، فَقَصَّتْ ذَلِكَ عَلَى زَوْجِهَا، فَقَالَ: وَاللَّهِ مَا تَمَنَّيْنَ إِلا هَذَا الْمَلِكَ الَّذِي نَزَلَ بنا، فَفَتَحَهَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَضَرَبَ عُنق زوجها صبرا، وتعرض من هناك من فتية النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ليتزوجها</div>
<div>When Allah’s Messenger (pbuh) reached Khyber while Safiya was a bride at her place. She saw in her dream that a sun came into her lap. She mentioned it before her husband. He said; ‘By Allah you do not wish for anyone except the King who has come upon us.’ Allah’s Messenger conquered Khyber and her husband was killed. From that time (of dream) she loved that the Prophet (pbuh) may marry her. (Tabarani Kabeer, Hadith 19667)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that Muslims were totally free to make up such fantasy traditions on their own, in order to defend the honour of their prophet. </p>
<p>If a woman accepts the marriage proposal and sleeps willingly with the man the same night, who killed her father, brother and husband, then it means only one thing she is trying to save herself from the humiliation that she has to face as a slave woman. </p>
<p>Other traditions also prove that, despite any such dream, Safiyyah considered Muhammad the most hated person. And in fact, at first, she denied even sleeping with him. </p>
<p>Therefore, if Safiyah really had told this fantasy story, it is far more likely that she made it up in order to gain the favour of her captor rather than actually having a fantasy prophetic dream such as this.   </p>]]></description>

			<title>Women's testimony is not even half but ZERO in serious Hudud cases</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><!--StartFragment --></p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:121">There is a widespread misunderstanding that the testimony of women is accepted and counted as half in all cases in Islam.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:149">This is a myth and only false propaganda by Muslim apologists. The reality is far worse for women, and they have been far worse degraded by Muhammad.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:95">In reality, their witness is only accepted in a few matters that are not of primary importance:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="9:1-11:0">
<li data-sourcepos="9:1-9:78">Women's testimony is accepted and counted as <strong>half</strong> <strong>only</strong> in <strong>financial</strong> matters.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="10:1-11:0">And a woman's testimony is accepted and counted as full only in a few matters that are about her body or related to her (like the birth of a child, breastfeeding a child, and her testimony <span class="citation-0 citation-end-0">if she is menstruating or not, or if she has hidden physical handicaps in her body etc.). These are the matters where men could not get firsthand information, and thus one is compelled to rely on the testimony of women.</span></li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="12:1-12:8">However:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="14:1-16:0">
<li data-sourcepos="14:1-14:215">In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud">Hudud</a>(Arabic: حدود) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qisas">Qisas</a> (Arabic قصأص) cases (like adultery, rape, robbery, theft, and murder, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirabah">Hirabah</a>, drinking alcohol, etc.), <span class="citation-1">the testimony of women is absolutely not accepted (not even as half).</span></li>
<li data-sourcepos="15:1-16:0"><span class="citation-1 citation-end-1">Similarly, in all other cases (which are not related to a woman's body or affairs), then again women's testimony is absolutely not accepted. These cases are like nikah</span> (marriage), talaq (divorce), raju' [restitution of conjugal rights], <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/women-and-divorce/ila-alayla-another-unjust-islamic-ruling-against-woman">Ila (الإيلاء)</a>, <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/divine-revelation-or-a-human-drama/zihar-another-unjust-islamic-way-to-divorce-a-woman">Zihar</a>, apostasy, parentage, <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%88%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9_%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9">al-Wakalah</a>, wills, etc.). Nevertheless, a few Islamic scholars accepted half testimony of women in these cases too, but the majority absolutely denied any testimony from women in these cases.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a case of Zina (adultery), where testimony of four people is needed, and women could not be included in those 4 witnesses (i.e. they all should be men). Quran say:</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=24&amp;verse=4">24:4</a>:</p>
<p>وَٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُوا۟ بِأَرْبَعَةِ <em><strong>شُهَدَآءَ</strong></em> فَٱجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَٰنِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلَا تَقْبَلُوا۟ لَهُمْ شَهَٰدَةً أَبَدًا ۚ</p>
<p>Translation: And those who accuse the chaste women, then not they bring four (male) witnesses <em><strong>(Arabic شُهَدَآءَ, which is genitive masculine plural noun)</strong></em>, then flog them (with) eighty lashe(s) and (do) not accept their testimony ever.</p>
<p>... And there are few cases where testimony of only 2 people is needed, but women are not included in them (i.e both witnesses should be men). These cases are of Hudud and Qisas, for example cutting hands for stealing, drinking alcohol, Hirabah (i.e. treason), and <em><strong>all Islamic scholars agree upon it</strong></em>.</p>
<p>And then there are cases, (which are not about woman's body and affairs, and thus) men could get direct information about them, and they are also not about the financial matters. These cases are like Nikah, Talaq, Raju' [restitution of conjugal rights], Ila (الإيلاء), Zihar, Apostasy, parentage, al-Wakalah, will-testaments etc., then according to <em><strong>majority of Fuqaha</strong></em> (Islamic jurists) testimony of 2 men is needed, but women are not included in it.</p>
<p>And a proof for it lies in this Quranic <strong>verse of divorce</strong> too:</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=65&amp;verse=2">65:2</a>:</p>
<p>فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُوا۟ ذَوَىْ<em><strong> </strong></em>عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلشَّهَٰدَةَ لِلَّهِ ۚ</p>
<p>Translation: Then when they have reached their term, then retain them with kindness or part with them with kindness. And take witness two <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>men</strong></span> <em><strong>(</strong>Arabic ذَوَىْ accusative masculine dual noun<strong>)</strong></em> just among you and establish the testimony for Allah.</p>
<p>And also, proof is found in the Quranic <strong>verse of</strong> <strong>will-testament</strong>:</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=5&amp;verse=106">5:106</a>:</p>
<p>يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ شَهَٰدَةُ بَيْنِكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ حِينَ ٱلْوَصِيَّةِ ٱثْنَانِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ أَوْ ءَاخَرَانِ مِنْ غَيْرِكُمْ إِنْ أَنتُمْ ضَرَبْتُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَأَصَٰبَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ ۚ تَحْبِسُونَهُمَا مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِٱللَّهِ إِنِ ٱرْتَبْتُمْ لَا نَشْتَرِى بِهِۦ ثَمَنًا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ ۙ وَلَا نَكْتُمُ شَهَٰدَةَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّآ إِذًا لَّمِنَ ٱلْءَاثِمِينَ</p>
<p>Translation: O you who believe! (Take) testimony among you when approaches one of you [the] death, (at the) time (of making) [the] a will two <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>men</strong></span> <strong><em>(</em></strong><em>Arabic ٱثْنَانِ: nominative masculine dual noun</em><strong><em>)</em></strong>, just, among you, or two other <strong>men</strong> <em>(Arabic اخَرَانِ: nominative masculine dual noun)</em> from other than you if you (are) travel(ing) in the earth then befalls you calamity (of) [the] death. Detain both of them from after the prayer and let them both swear by Allah if you doubt, "Not we will exchange it for a price even if he is (of) a near relative, and not we will conceal testimony (of) Allah.</p>
<p>And about Nikah (marriage) too, the holy prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p>( لا نكاح إلا بولي وشاهدي عدل )</p>
<p>Translation: Nikah could not be held without the guardian and<strong><em> 2 male witnesses</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This tradition has been recorded by Imam Bayhiqi.</p>
<p>While Imam Malik narrated from Imam Zuhri:</p>
<p>مضت السنة بأنه لا تجوز شهادة النساء في الحدود ولا في النكاح والطلاق</p>
<p>Translation: It has been a regular practice according to Sunnah <em><strong>that testimony of women is not accepted in Hudud, Nikah and Talaq</strong></em>.</p>
<p>But Ahnaf (i.e. follower of Imam Abu Hanifa) differed from it. They accept the witness of women in these matters too, but consider their witness to be half than of men. ...<br>Nevertheless, <strong><em>majority of jurists denied the testimony of women in these cases too, and limited the half testimony of women in the financial matters only</em></strong>.</p>
<p>And then there are few matters where only the testimonies of women are accepted, and these are matters like birth of a child, breastfeeding a child, and those matters/physical handicaps which are hidden in her body, upon which men could not get firsthand information. In all these cases testimony of women is accepted (and counted as a full witness).</p>

<p>Therefore, all the Quranic Verses (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=24&amp;verse=4">24:4</a> regarding adultery, <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=65&amp;verse=2">65:2</a> regarding Talaq and <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=5&amp;verse=106">5:106</a> regarding will-testament) demand only males as witnesses.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId829986"></a>Hadith:</h2>
<p>Imam Ibn Abi Shaybah recorded the following tradition in his book al-Musannaf (<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ufsE_z5q2akJ:islamport.com/d/1/mtn/1/114/4256.html+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de">link</a>):</p>

<p>Imam Zuhri said: It has been a regular practice since the time of the holy prophet and the first 2 caliphs (i.e. Abu Bakr &amp; Umar) that the testimony of a woman is not accepted in the cases of Hudud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very clear tradition that women were not allowed to testify in the cases of Hudud.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Muslim apologists try to use their old tactic and they try to get rid of this Hadith by declaring it a <strong><em>weak tradition</em></strong>.</p>
<p>But fortunately, this tactic by Muslim apologists does not work here while Imam Ibn Abi Shaybah also made a whole chapter regarding witnesses of women in Hudud cases, and there he recorded 7 more Ahadith. And all of these Ahadith are supporting each other and unanimously tell the same fact that women's testimonies are not allowed in Hudud cases.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, these Ahadith are also supported from the facts that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is not even a single hadith directly from Muhammad, which claims otherwise i.e. where Muhammad ever directly allowed the testimony of women in any Hudud case.</li>
<li>And there is also not even a single incident during Muhammad's and later during Caliph's time, where any woman ever testified in any court in Hudud cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please understand the tactics of Muslim apologists. They are themselves unable to provide a single hadith in their favour, but all they do is try to declare all those multiple Ahadith to be weak, which go against their wishes.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId720835"></a>Ijma (i.e. unanimous decision):</h2>
<p>There has been an Ijma (i.e. unanimous decision) of all the Muslim Jurists and the whole Ummah of the last 14 centuries that the witness of women is not allowed in Hudud cases.</p>
<p>Actually, not a single Muslim woman ever testified in any <em><strong>Islamic court</strong></em> during the last 1400 years in any Hudud case.</p>
<p>Muslim women suffered a lot. There is not a single incident during the last 1400 years, where a Muslim woman was raped, and then any <em><strong>Islamic Court</strong></em> accepted her testimony in her own rape case.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId400066"></a>Dire consequences of not accepting women's testimony in Hudud and Qisas cases:</h2>
<p>Please think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if theft took place at home, where only women were present and witnessed it?</li>
<li>What if a murder took place at home in front of women only?</li>
<li>Why can't they testify against the culprits and thieves if they are the sole witness?</li>
<li>Does Islam consider all women to be totally BLIND (if not from eyes, then from the mind) that they could not identify the culprits?</li>
</ul>
<p>And the case of rape is even more strange and the biggest madness, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women (who are raped) are the first eyewitness of this crime, but their own witness is rejected by Islam.</li>
<li>Even worse, if they go to the courts to get justice, but fail to produce 4 men as eyewitnesses of their rape, then the Islamic court put those poor women in prison and lashed them 80 times in name of 'false Accusation/slander' against their rapists.</li>
<li>Even if the poor woman does not go to Islami court, still her pregnancy can be used as proof against her: Cases of rape were converted into a case of adultery if a woman could not prove the rape. Her pregnancy and her reporting of rape were taken as her admission of fornication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Madness!!! Madness!!! Madness!!!</p>
<p>Pakistani government imposed these Sharia laws in name of Hudud Ordinance in 1979 in the country. And the result was (<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1096629">link</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of women were sent to prison by the courts. Why? While they went to court for seeking justice after they were raped. But Pakistani Courts rejected their own testimonies while they were women. And since those women were unable to produce 4 men as eyewitnesses, thus, courts charged them with offence of making false slanders against their rapists.</li>
<li>A permanent state of harassment for women: This law was used very successfully by the rapists to harass, exploit, control and blackmail the women.</li>
<li>Moreover, investigation shows that women in jail on charges of Zina had been put there by their own fathers, brothers and husbands. It was used to torment women who marry of their choice, wives wishing to get a divorce, divorced women wishing to re-marry or who try to get custody of the children etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an unbelievably big oppression of Islam against women!!!</p>
<p>Remember, this is 1400 years long history of oppression of Islam against women.</p>
<p>You cannot find<em><strong> a SINGLE case</strong></em> in the last 1400 years of documented history of Islam, where a woman was raped, and then she was able to get justice through any <em><strong>Islamic court</strong></em> while they rejected their witnesses for being a woman, and there were never 4 male eyewitnesses present as she was raped. There were a few cases where the rapists themselves accepted their crime and thus punished, but no raped woman was able to produce 4 men as eyewitnesses during the last 1400 years.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId49723"></a>First Reason for depriving women of their testimonies: Muhammad deemed them to be deficient in memory and deficient in intelligence</h2>
<p>Muhammad deprived women of their testimonies completely in Hudud cases, and made their testimonies half in financial matters, while he believed that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Women are deficient in memory and they forget often.</li>
<li>And women are also deficient in intelligence.</li>
</ol>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/2.282">2:282</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], t<em><strong>hen a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs (through forgetfulness), then the other can remind her. </strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 304</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's messenger (ﷺ) said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you." The women asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?" <em><strong>He said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?"</strong></em> They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her religion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad considered women as creatures with low intelligence and memory. But still, women were allowed to have their own wealth and to manage their finances (perhaps Muhammad was unable to deny them this right while his first wife Khadija had her own wealth and she fed Muhammad through it when he was poor). Therefore, if women were managing their own finances, then there was no reason to deny their testimony in financial matters. Nevertheless, still Muhammad decreased the value of their testimony to half in the financial matters too.</p>
<p>And as far as Hudud's cases are concerned, then Muhammad considered them too low in intelligence and memory to be considered worthy enough to testify in these cases.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>If women have a bad memory or forget or easily err and are deficient in intelligence, then 'Aisha and other female companions must have told many wrong Ahadith. </p>
<p>These contradictions appear in Islam while there is no Allah sitting in the heavens, and all these revelations were only made by Muhammad himself. Thus, we see these contradictions and human mistakes in the revelation. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId678619"></a>Second Reason for depriving women/slaves of their testimonies: Muhammad discriminated against people on the basis of their STATUS</h2>
<p>Muhammad considered women to be lower in <strong><em>status</em></strong> than men.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.34">4:34</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ٱلرِّجَالُ قَوَّٰمُونَ عَلَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَآ أَنفَقُوا۟ مِنْ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ</p>
<p>Men stand superior to women in that God hath preferred some of them over others, and in that they expend of their wealth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also proven by the fact that Muhammad also deprived the slaves (even the male slaves) and the non-Muslims of their testimonies, while he considered them to be lower in status than the free Muslims.</p>
<p class="western">Imam Shafii wrote in his book “Ahkam-ul-Quran, vol 2, page 142 (<a href="https://answering-islam.net/BehindVeil/btv4.html">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">And the testimony should be from the free men, and not from the <em><strong>slaves</strong></em>. Similarly, these free men should be the follower of our religion (i.e. they should be Muslims), while the testimony of <em><strong>non-Muslims</strong></em> free men is not accepted</blockquote>
<p class="western">Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd writes in his Fiqh Book (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160117184347/http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/RISALA.htm">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western"><span lang="ur-PK">ولا تجوز شهادة المحدود ولا شهادة عبد ولا صبي ولا كافر</span><br>The testimony of someone who has been given a fixed punishment, or of a <em><strong>slave</strong></em>, a minor or a <em><strong>Kafir</strong></em>, is inadmissible.</blockquote>
<p>A male slave and a male Kafir didn't suffer from deficiency of memory and intelligence according to Muhammad, but it is their lower status which Muhammad used in order to discriminate against them and deprive them of their testimonies.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId592937"></a>Depriving slave women their testimony led to their rape and their inability to get any justice</h3>
<p class="western">There were people who used to force their slave girls into prostitution.</p>
<p class="western">When those slave girls complained to Muhammad,<em><strong> then he didn't punish their owners for compelling them to fornication</strong></em>. </p>
<p class="western">But why didn't he punish them?</p>
<p class="western">The answer is, that the witness of those slave girls was not admissible in Islamic courts. </p>
<p class="western">This incident is present in the Quran itself.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/24.33">24:33</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">Sunnan Abu Dawud, Kitab-ul-Talaq (<a href="http://www.hadithurdu.com/03/3-2-547/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">Musaykah, a slave-girl of some Ansari, came and said: My owner forces me to commit fornication (in order to earn money from it). Thereupon the following verse was revealed: <em>"(Quran 24:33) And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful."</em></blockquote>
<p>Actually, slaves are absolutely not allowed to go to court against their owners in any matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, a slave girl could cry as much as she can about her rape, but her witness is not accepted in any Islamic court, which makes it impossible to punish her owner.</p>
<p>That is why, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad), at maximum, only recommended the owners not to force the slave women into fornication, <strong><em>but he was unable to punish the owners for forcing their slave girls into prostitution.</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId381512"></a>Excuses by Muslim apologists:</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId821962"></a>1st Excuse: Women have half testimony, while they are <em>emotional</em></h3>
<p>Muhammad blamed women for having low memory and low intelligence. But Muslim apologists added one blame from their own pockets i.e. Women's testimony is rejected in hudud cases (or it is half in financial matters) while they are <em><strong>emotional and make mistakes while testifying due to their emotions.</strong></em></p>
<p>But contrary to this claim by Muslim apologists, we have data of several millions of testimonies of women in non-Muslim countries, and nowhere it is suggested that women were making mistakes in their testimonies due to emotions.</p>
<p>Therefore, Muslim apologists don't have to come up with empty conjectures from their own pockets that women make mistakes in their testimonies due to their emotions, but they have to bring scientific studies which support their claim.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The question is not if women are emotional or not, but the question is if women are emotional to the <em><strong>extent</strong></em> where they become unable to testify and where they make mistakes on that huge level where the disadvantages of their testimonies outperform the advantages of their testimonies.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId381673"></a>2nd Excuse: 2 female witnesses are required in order to relax the responsibility upon one woman</h3>
<p>Ghamidi came out with this excuse regarding 2 female witnesses as compared to 1 male witness (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_women%27s_testimony_in_Islam">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Islam asks for two female witnesses against one male in the case of financial transactions as a means of <em><strong>relaxation of responsibility</strong></em> as it is not very suited to their temperament, sphere of interest, and usual environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>As compared to this conjecture of Ghamidi, the holy prophet of Muslims himself told that the testimony of a woman is half while they are deficient in intelligence. While Quran gave the reason that women err due to their deficiency in memory.</p>
<p>So, who is correct here? Ghamidi or Prophet Muhammad/Quran?</p>
<p>The truth is, all these 3 are wrong. The data of witnesses of millions of women in non-Muslim countries prove that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neither are they deficient in intelligence.</li>
<li>Nor do they err due to memory</li>
<li>Nor do they need any so-called relaxation of responsibility, so that their single half testimony is rejected without the support of 2nd woman.</li>
</ul>
<p>This rejection of the witness of a single woman is not called a relaxation in responsibility, <em><strong>but a burden upon her</strong></em>, as she has to carry another woman along with her in order to complete her singular half-witness. And it is a burden upon the second woman while she is compelled to go the court against her temperament, sphere of interest, and usual environment.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId419555"></a>3rd Excuse: The wife of Caliph Uthman witnessed his murder</h3>
<p>Muslim apologists also bring this one tradition in their defence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_women%27s_testimony_in_Islam">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_women%27s_testimony_in_Islam</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, some hadith record the presence of only single female testimonies in the cases of one murder and the assassination of Caliph Uthman. Respectively, the acceptance of these testimonies resulted in the death penalty for the murderer and start of a campaign against the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citing this singular incident is again a deception from Muslim apologists.</p>
<p>Neither was any court held, nor the wife of Uthman (i.e. Naila) was asked to bring her testimony there.</p>
<p>It was not the case of murder and witness, but it was the case of Hirabah (i.e. treason). And there were hundreds and thousands of people from Uthman's family (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_dynasty">Banu Umayya</a>), who were witnesses to this treason.</p>
<p>Therefore, the fact remains the same during Muhammad's era, or era of his caliphs, or during the last 14 centuries, the testimony of a Muslim woman was never accepted in any Islamic court in any case of Hudud.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId753238"></a>4th Excuse: Some Zahiri scholars also accepted women's testimony as half in Hudud cases</h2>
<p>Muslim apologists bring this argument (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_women%27s_testimony_in_Islam">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Averroes (i.e. Ibn Rushd), certain scholars said that in these cases a woman's testimony is unacceptable regardless of whether they testify alongside male witnesses. However, he writes that the school of thought known as the <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Zahiris</strong> believe that if two or more women testify alongside a male witness, then (as in cases regarding financial transactions, discussed above), their testimony is acceptable.<br><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Ibn Rushd. Bidayatu’l-Mujtahid, 1st ed., vol. 4, (Beirut: Daru’l-Ma‘rifah, 1997), p. 311 ...</strong></em><br>Furthermore, some hadith record the presence of only single female testimonies in the cases of one murder and the assassination of Caliph Uthman. Respectively, the acceptance of these testimonies resulted in the death penalty for the murderer and start of a campaign against the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is true, then it is good that few Zahiri scholars accepted women's testimony. Any sane person with some logic will automatically reject this injustice against women. Nevertheless, it has nothing to do with Islam, as the Quran and Muhammad and his Caliphs never accepted their testimony and never let them witness the whole of their lives. Islam is what Quran and Muhammad said, and not what few Zahiri scholars later said (provided they really said it).</p>
<p>Moreover, </p>
<ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP">
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Who were those Zahiri scholars actually? Why are their names not given and why is it not told what they wrote? It is only a vague statement.</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">How many centuries after Muhammad those Zahiri scholars came (like Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim came 7 centuries after Muhammad)?</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Did any Zahiri scholar before them accept women's testimony too? If not, why then they went against the Ijma of Islamic scholars (including Zahiris) before them?</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">What was their proof from Quran &amp; Sunnah? As we already have Quranic verses and Ahadith, which all are unanimous about women having no right to testimony in Hudud cases.</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Without any proof from Quran/Hadith, how can merely a CONJECTURE by any Zahiri or non-Zahiri scholar defend Islam in this case?</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Did women in their era, or after their era, testify in Islamic courts in Hudud cases? In fact, even if they did after their era, still it is not going to save Islam itself from this injustice again women, while Islam is Quran and what Muhammad did, and not what later any Zahiri scholar said, based upon his own conjecture.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As far as proof from Quran and Hadith is concerned, then there exists no proof of women having any right to testify.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">At maximum, present-day Muslim apologists are able to bring up the incident of the killing of Uthman and her wife Naila. But we have already discussed in detail above that this claim is false while neither any court was held, nor Naila ever testified it there. But it was the case of Hiraba for which there were thousands of (male) witnesses were present.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId570248"></a>5th Excuse: Culprits get Tazir (lighter punishment) due to woman's testimony in Hudud cases</h3>
<p>Muslim apologists also come up with this excuse today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if Islamic courts don't give the stipulated Hudud Punishments in case of murder, theft, fornication etc., but still they can give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazir">Tazir</a> (i.e. is a lighter punishments) in light of witnesses of women, or in case if less than 4 witnesses are present in cases of fornication and rape. For example, the stipulated punishment of fornication (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud"><strong><em>Hadd</em></strong></a>) in presence of 4 male witnesses is 100 lashes. But if only 4 female witnesses are present, then an Islamic court can give half the punishment (i.e. 50 lashes). </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazir">Tazir</a> in Hudud cases (i.e. murder, rape, fornication, theft ...)  is a Biddah (a newly invented thing in Islam).</p>
<p>There was no concept of Tazir punishments in Hudud cases in the mind of Muhammad (or Allah, if He really exists and is different from Muhammad). That is why neither Quran ever mentioned Tazir nor ever mentioned that it is a substitute system in the absence of male witnesses. And Muhammad never let any woman testify in cases of Hudud in his whole life, neither for full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud">Hadd</a> punishment nor for any lighter Tazir punishment. </p>
<p>And after Muhammad, Abu Bakr and Umar and then the whole Ummah too in the last 1400 years never let any woman testify in Islamic courts neither for Hadd punishment nor for any lighter Tazir punishment.</p>
<p>It is only in this century (rather only a few years ago) that they introduced the use of Tazir punishments in Hudud cases in light of testimonies of women. In Pakistan, only in 2006, a Bill was presented in the National Assembly for introducing Tazir punishments in cases of Hudud where women were also allowed to testify (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudood_Ordinances#:%7E:text=It%20replaced%20parts%20of%20the,by%20the%20Women%27s%20Protection%20Bill.">link</a>). Even then Muslim scholars were deadly against it, but human rights groups and women put a lot of pressure, and in the end, they had to change the Sharia rules and made the witness of women admissible in cases of Hudud too (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudood_Ordinances#:%7E:text=It%20replaced%20parts%20of%20the,by%20the%20Women%27s%20Protection%20Bill.">link</a>). </p>
<p>Moreover, law experts also point out how ridiculous the Islamic system of punishment becomes due to these two parallel systems of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud">Hadd</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazir">Tazir</a>. There are 2 different punishments for the same crime. According to experts, in the eyes of law either a crime has 100% taken place, or 100% didn't happen. There is no such thing as 50% or 60% or 70% crime and thus only 50% punishment or 60% punishment. In case of doubt, you could not punish any human being. But this parallel system of Islam says if witnesses are females, then reduce the punishment for the same crime to half. </p>
<p>These contradictions in the Islamic system of law are happening only due to reason that there is no All-Wise and All-Knowing Allah sitting in the heavens, but all those revelations were made by Muhammad himself. And while he was a human being (and not all-wise), thus we see these human errors in Sharia laws. </p>]]></description>

<p>So, Muhammad ordered: "<strong>Marry the one who is fertile and loving"</strong>.</p>
<p>But here occurs a problem. Today Muslims are totally confused and asking this question themselves (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140612004851/http://forum.mohaddis.com/threads/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%B3%DB%92-%D9%BE%DB%81%D9%84%DB%92-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%88%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D9%88-%DA%A9%D8%B3-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AD-%D9%BE%DB%81%DA%86%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%92-%DA%AF%D8%A7-%DA%A9%DB%81-%D9%88%DB%81-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%AA-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%86%DB%92-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A8%DA%86%DB%92-%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%AF%D8%A7-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%86%DB%92-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C-%DB%81%DB%92%D8%9F.23334">link</a>): <strong>"How do you find out before marriage which woman is fertile and the loving one?</strong>"</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If a woman is divorced/widow, then one could estimate if she is fertile/loving or not,<strong> but how to estimate these 2 characteristics in a virgin girl</strong>? </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is proof enough to conclude that there was no Allah behind the revelations, and Muhammad was giving these Sharia rulings on his own, and that is why we find these human errors in these rulings. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And Muhammad in another Hadith asked to marry virgin girls instead of divorced/widow women.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5080">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5080</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: When I got married, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, "What type of lady have you married?" I replied, "I have married a matron' He said, "Why, don't you have a liking for the virgins and for fondling them?" Jabir also said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And Muhammad claimed the following about the virgin girls, that they bear more children:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1861">Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 1861</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">عَلَيْكُمْ بِالأَبْكَارِ فَإِنَّهُنَّ أَعْذَبُ أَفْوَاهًا وَأَنْتَقُ أَرْحَامًا وَأَرْضَى بِالْيَسِيرِ</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">“The Messenger of Allah said: 'You should marry virgins, for their mouths are sweeter, their wombs are more prolific (i.e. they bear many children) and they are satisfied with less.'”<br>(<a href="https://dorar.net/h/8db83b0b91847fb8168890c864e269d6">Hasan- Fair Hadith</a>) According to Albani</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, these assertions lack logical connections and demonstrate further human error on Muhammad's part, while:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is not connected with the virginity of a woman if her mouth is sweeter or not, but it is linked with her own behaviour. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the guarantee that a woman is going to bear many children (i.e. their wombs being prolific) does not lie in her virginity, but this lies in her health. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And there is no connection in it that virgin girls become satisfied with less, while widow/divorced women don't become satisfied with less. </li>
</ul>
<p>All these claims from Muhammad are once again proving only one thing there ss no divine Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making all this religion  honis own and thus we find all these human errors in the revelation. </p>

<p>And then there was an incident where a pair was unable to have a baby of their own, and thus they adopted another baby. Mother raised him as her own child.

<p>But the mother became extremely angry and she refused to cut the mother-son relationship with him.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, the question is, why didn't he marry another woman during his last 3 years?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The answer lies in the huge scandal of the secret sexual relationship of Mariyah (his slave girl).</p>

Thereupon Allah's Messenger said to 'Ali: Go and strike his neck. 'Ali came to him and he found him in a well making his body cool. 'Ali said to him: Come out, and as he took hold of his hand and brought him out, he found that his sexual organ had been cut. Hadrat 'Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah's Apostle and said: Allah's Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Why was that Coptic slave charged with fornication with Mariya?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">While Muhammad failed to make any other of his existing 12 wives bear a child for the last decade. Thus, people considered Muhammad to be infertile. In this situation, when slave girl Mariya became pregnant, then rumours arose that Mariya had a hidden sexual relationship with her cousin (i.e. the Coptic slave).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad ordered the killing of that Coptic slave without any court trial or witnesses.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even after it became clear that Coptic slave didn't have the sexual organ, still Muhammad kept on suspecting Mariya of illegal sex. But he was unable to punish Mariya without the witnesses. And then people started making even more rumours about it. In order to make their mouths shut, Muhammad then claimed that Jibrael came and confirmed that Mariya was pregnant with a child from him.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Ibn Kathir recorded the following tradition:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anas said, when Ibrahim was born to Muhammad (from his slave-girl Maria al-Qibtiyya), then Muhammad became doubtful if Ibrahim was really his son or not. Upon that angel Jibrael came to him and confirmed to him that Ibrahim was indeed his son. Only after that Muhammad believed that Ibrahim was his son.<br>Reference: al-Baday wa al-Nahaya by Ibn Kathir, under the Incidents of 11th Hijri year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But Muhammad himself kept on doubting the parentage of Ibrahim (his son from Mariya) even till his death.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2316" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Sahih Muslim</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">فلما توفى إبراهيم قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ان إبراهيم ابني وانه مات في الثدي وان له لظئرين تكملان رضاعه في الجنة</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"... then when Ibrahim demised the holy prophet of Islam (peace be upon him) said, " Ibrahim<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU"> was indeed my son</strong> and passed away at the age of infancy"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, it seems that this huge scandal of the illegal sexual relationship of Mariya ended Muhammad's journey of marrying any other woman, while people had already been raising questions about Muhammad's fertility.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore:</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">According to Islamic Sharia, a Mahram man can see the whole body of a woman, except for her vagina and buttocks.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This means:</p>
<ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR">
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">A father can see even the naked breast of his daughter,</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">and a son can also see the naked breasts of his mother,</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">and a brother can also see the naked breasts of his sister.</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">And a nephew/uncle can also see the naked breasts of their aunt/niece.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is written in Fatawa Alamgiri (also knowns as Fatawa-e-Hindiya, as it was compiled by 500 scholars from India on the orders of Emperor Aurganzeb Alamgir). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080103201511/http://feqh.al-islam.com/Display.asp?Mode=0&amp;MaksamID=896&amp;DocID=73&amp;ParagraphID=20362&amp;Diacratic=0">Link</a>:</p>

<p>As for looking at his Mahram women (like mother, adult daughter, sister and every Mahram female like the grandmother, child, grandchild and aunt) we say that it is permissible for him to look at the apparent and hidden areas of their adornment, which include the head, hair, neck, <strong>chest</strong>, ears, shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hands, legs, and face. This is the correct view, as mentioned in Al-Muhit. Whatever is permissible to look at, it is also permissible to touch, look at, and wink at without any barrier.</p>

<p>As you rightly point out, it was stated in an earlier detailed article that the nakedness (awra) of a woman in front of her Mahram men (unmarriageable kin) such as the father, brother, son, paternal uncle (father’s brother), maternal uncle (mother’s brother), father in-law, grandson, husband’s son (from another marriage) and son in-law consists of the area between the navel and knees (including the knees) and the stomach and back. It was also stated that as a consequence<span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;"> it will be permissible for a woman to expose her head, hair, face, neck, <b>chest,</b> shoulders, hands, forearms, and legs from below the knees in front of Mahram men</span> and impermissible to expose the stomach, back or any area which is between the navel and knees. This ruling was based on the verse of Surah al-Nur (24-31) as explained by the Hanafi jurists (fuqaha) in <i>al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya</i>, 5/328, <i>al-Hidaya</i>, 4/461 and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is also evident from this Hadith of 'Aisha.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:251">Sahih Bukhari, 251</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Abu Salama: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">`Aisha's brother and I went to `Aisha and he asked her about the bath of the Prophet. She brought a pot containing about a Sa` of water <strong>and took a bath and poured it over her head and at that time there was a screen between her and us</strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani is considered as an ultimate Hadith Master by Muslims. He wrote the commentary of Sahih Bukhari. And under the commentary of this Hadith, he wrote (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220923133859/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;idfrom=490&amp;idto=495&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=178">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p> قال القاضي عياض : ظاهره أنهما رأيا عملها في رأسها وأعالي جسدها مما يحل نظره للمحرم ; لأنها خالة أبي سلمة من الرضاع أرضعته أختها أم كلثوم وإنما سترت أسافل بدنها مما لا يحل للمحرم النظر إليه </p>
<p>Qadi Ayad said:<strong> It is apparent that they could see her actions from her head and the top half of her body, because they were allowed to do as she was a milk-aunt to Abu Salamah and his brother from her sister Umm Kulthum. As for the lower part of her body, this was covered.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet’s wife exposed the entire upper half of her body, hair, breasts, and all. The Muslim Scholars say that this is permissible because the sister of Aisha had nursed Abu Salamah and his brother.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 'Awrah of a slave woman is also from the navel to the knee</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, the 'Awrah of a slave woman in Islam was also from the navel to the knee. And thus all people were allowed to see their naked breasts. There were thousands of slave women present in public and in front of Muhammad with naked breasts.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You can find all the references to the naked breasts of slave women in this article:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/islamic-slavery/islam-no-hijab-for-slave-women-and-their-breasts-naked-in-public">Part 2: Allah/Muhammad forced the poor slave women to move with naked breasts in the public</a></p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Background: How is it possible?</h2>
<p>There were many cultures present where women did not hide their breasts. Even today, such cultures still exist.</p>
<p>In pre-Islamic Arabia, women also did not hide their breasts.</p>
<p>However, there was an old tradition in Arabia where women of high status used to wear a hijab, which was considered their right and honor. Slave women and prostitutes, on the other hand, were not allowed to wear a hijab.</p>
<p>Muhammad later reintroduced this old Arabic custom, allowing only "free Muslim women" to wear a hijab. He prohibited slave women from wearing one.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Thus, all slave women were present in public with naked breasts throughout 1300 years long the history of Islamic slavery. </span></p>
<p>However, it's important to note that the free Muslim women were not required to wear a hijab in front of their mahram men, such as their fathers, sons, brothers, or uncles. As a result, their breasts were exposed in front of these men.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that the association of the hijab with modesty is a later development and not part of its original purpose. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) introduced the hijab as a way to distinguish between high-status free Muslim women and low-status slave women.</p>
<p>This has led to a significant contradiction, making it challenging for Muslims to justify the hijab in modern times. The reality is that the hijab has become a symbol of the oppressive treatment of millions of enslaved women throughout history, rather than a symbol of modesty or piety.</p>

			<title>Islam and the disease of Virginophilia only for women</title>
			<link>https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/women-general/islam-and-the-disease-of-virginophilia-only-for-women</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/women-general/islam-and-the-disease-of-virginophilia-only-for-women</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Let's begin and examine the double standards in Islam:</p>
<p><strong>For Men:</strong><br>There is no difference between a young virgin man and a non-virgin man. Women should marry them without showing any preference to one over the other.</p>
<p><strong>For Women:</strong><br>However, when it comes to women, Islam considers widowed or divorced women as second-class citizens, labelling them as non-virgins. They are deemed inferior to virgin girls. Muslim men are commanded to choose virgin brides over non-virgin widows or divorcees, even if the latter are younger.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And Muhammad told the following reason for this:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:715e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Sahih Muslim</a>, <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3219" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Sunan Nasai</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Jabir said: "I got married then I came to the Prophet and he said: 'Have you got married, O Jabir?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'To a virgin or to a previously married woman?' I said: 'To a previously married woman.' He said: 'Why not a virgin, <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">so you could play with her and she could play with you?'</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad provided two reasons for why men should marry virgins instead of widows or divorcees. The first reason he gave was that virgins are more fun to play with and can play with their husbands too. However, this reasoning is flawed because widows and divorcees can also be playful and enjoy intimacy with their partners. Denying them the same opportunities for marriage and treating them as less valuable than virgins is unjust and cruel.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the next reason that Muhammad described was as under.</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://dorar.net/h/8db83b0b91847fb8168890c864e269d6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Sunnan Ibn Majah</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم:" عليكم بالابكار، فإنهن اعذب افواها، وانتق ارحاما، وارضى باليسير</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Messenger of Allah said: 'You should marry virgins, for their <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">mouths are sweeter</strong>, <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">their wombs are more prolific (i.e. they give birth to more children),</strong> and <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">they are satisfied with less.</strong>'Sheikh Albani declared it a Hasan (fair) Hadith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The second reason Muhammad gave was that virgins have sweeter mouths, are more fertile, and are content with less. However, these qualities do not necessarily depend on a woman's virginity. A woman's sweetness and fertility are determined by her natural disposition and health, respectively. Moreover, a woman's ability to be content with less is a function of her patience and character, not her sexual experience.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If Muhammad truly wanted to offer sound advice, he should have suggested that men marry women based on their positive qualities, regardless of whether they are virgins or not. For instance, he could have advised men to seek out women with good natures, sweet dispositions, and strong health. Instead, Muhammad's arguments only served to make life more challenging for widows and divorcees, and perpetuated harmful attitudes towards women.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Due to this same disease of Virginophilia, the writer of the Quran threatened the wives of Muhammad, that they should obey Muhammad, otherwise Allah would replace them with newer wives who would also be virgins.</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://quranx.com/66.5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">66:5</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Perhaps his Lord, if he divorced you [all], would substitute for him wives better than you - submitting [to Allah], believing, devoutly obedient, repentant, worshipping, and traveling - [ones] previously married <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">and virgins</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Additionally, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) promised Muslim men that they would receive 72 Houris in Paradise, all of whom would be virgins and remain so forever, regaining their virginity after each sexual encounter (Quran 56:35-36).</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://quranx.com/56.36?context=3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">56:35-36</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We have created (Houris) of special creation. And made them virgins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Poor widow/divorced women will neither get the virgin young boys (i.e. <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghilman" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Ghilman </a>Male Houris) in this world nor will they get them in paradise.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">These poor divorced/widow women will again get only those Muslim men in paradise, who will be busy in sex with those other 72 virgin Houris too. And the poor women had to wait for their turns in paradise too, just like in this world they had to wait for their turn when their husbands came to them after making sex with other wives and other dozens of slave girls.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This brainwashing has resulted in the entire Islamic society suffering from the disease of virginophilia.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Those women who were married as virgins had the opportunity to taunt and mock the other non-virgin wives, telling them that they were better than them because they were married as virgin girls. 'Aisha herself used to taunt the other wives of Muhammad throughout their lives, boasting that she was better than them because she was a virgin when she was married.</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Sahih Bukhari</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Narrated `Aisha:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I said, "O Allah's Messenger! Suppose you landed in a valley where there is a tree of which something has been eaten (i.e. non-virgin women) and then you found trees of which nothing has been eaten (i.e. virgin girls), of which tree would you let your camel graze?" <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">He (the prophet Muhammad) said, "(I will let my camel graze) of the one of which nothing has been eaten before.</strong>" (The sub-narrator added: `<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Aisha meant that Allah's Messenger had not married a virgin besides herself.</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Note that the love of a woman cannot be compared to a material object like the leaves of a tree, which diminishes in quantity when consumed. Muhammad made an error by agreeing with 'Aisha's flawed analogy, which likened a woman's love to the leaves of a tree.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muslim Excuse: But prophet Muhammad married only one virgin girl</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Women of that time too didn’t like their husbands to have multiple wives. When Muhammad wed the wealthy lady Khadijah, he was financially dependent on Khadijah. And what to talk about a beautiful young virgin girl, she didn’t even allow Muhammad to marry any other old widow lady or even to take any slave girl for pleasure. Khadijah was 15 years older than Muhammad, yet Muhammad didn’t dare to oppose her in the matter of marrying other women.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, when Muhammad asked for the hand of the virgin ‘Aisha, Abu Bakr asked in surprise how he could marry her while he was her uncle (</span><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5081"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih Bukhari</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).  Although Abu Bakr allowed Muhammad to marry ‘Aisha at that time, he didn’t send her to Muhammad’s house to consummate the marriage. Muhammad had to wait three years for this. Thus, this Nikah with a virgin girl wasn’t so easy for Muhammad. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Till that time, when Muhammad gained power in Medina and started taking multiple wives, he had already passed the prime age of marriage and was already an old man of 58 years. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Then he had already married Hafsa and Umm Salama too before the revelation of verse 4:3, which stipulated the maximum number of wives to be four. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">When Muhammad again used revelation to make those women lawful to him who presented themselves as a gift, he had to put another limit on himself—he could not marry other women even if he was pleased with their beauty (Verse 33:52). Still, ‘Aisha became furious about it. She mocked Muhammad, saying that Allah hastened only in fulfilling his sexual desires (</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5113">Sahih Bukhari</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Then Muhammad made all types of women lawful to him and married the young 20-year-old Juwayriya and 16-year-old Safiyyah.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Then he acquired a virgin and beautiful slave girl named Mariyah too. </li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, as the number of Muhammad's wives increased, the anger of ‘Aisha and the other wives also increased. It was not easy for Muhammad to get his hands on another young virgin girl after having so many wives and concubines. Despite using revelations, his morals were questioned by his wives, and he was discouraged from taking on new wives. Muhammad always needed an excuse to satisfy his previous wives to cross the limits of four wives.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Islamist's Excuse: But the vagina of a virgin is tight</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Islamists still have a lot of ignorance, and they don't want to know modern scientific facts either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern science tells us that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if a penis of a man is huge, still it has no ability to increase the elasticity of a woman's vagina. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elasticity of a woman's vagina neither increases nor decreases due to sex, but it is mostly dependent upon the woman's increasing age, and her health.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Men get this feeling of tightness in the virgins, while they are initially of young age, and are at the prime of their health. But as time goes by, even without any sex, they will start to lose the tightness. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, a vagina of a widow/divorced woman of young age will be tighter than of a virgin girl of older age. </span></li>
</ul>

<li><span>Even after carrying the baby in her womb for nine months, a mother does not have the right to name her child; that right belongs solely to the father. <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/267629/she-does-not-like-the-name-that-her-husband-chose-for-the-baby-girl-and-she-calls-her-by-a-different-name">Link</a>. </span></li>
<li>Islam allows that even a Breastfed Baby Girl can be married and used for sexual pleasure. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/marriage-rape-of-minor-girls/71-islam-even-a-breastfed-baby-girl-can-be-married-and-used-for-sexual-pleasure">Link</a>. ['Aisha was a little lucky girl that she was handed over to her husband at the age of 9 years, and not as a baby]</li>
<li><strong>Khul'</strong> (خلع):<sub> </sub>Only men have the right to divorce. If a woman wants to have a divorce, then she has to offer RANSOM money to her husband. If he accepts the offer and divorces her, then she gets her freedom. But if the husband rejects the offer, then no Islamic court can compel him to divorce her and she will not get her freedom. She is compelled to stay with her husband, even if he is abusive, or even if she dislikes him. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/33-khul-not-right-of-woman-but-of-man-only">Link</a>. </li>
<li>If a divorced woman remarries, then she will lose CUSTODY of all of her Children. The reason is that Islam considers she cannot provide sexual services to her 2nd husband properly in the presence of children from her first husband. Unbelievable. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/12-strange-islam-if-a-divorced-woman-remarries-then-she-will-lose-the-custody-of-her-children">Link</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Halala (Tahleel Marriage)</strong>:<sup> </sup>Even if the husband is at fault for giving the divorce, but still only the poor woman has to suffer and get raped by another man before going back to her first husband (Many women have to agree to go through this sexual abuse while it is their only chance to stay with their children from their first husbands). <span style="color: #ff0000;">The Origin lies directly in pre-Islamic Arab culture who also practised Halala and Muhammad took it from them. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/29-halala-tahleel-marriage">Link</a>.</span> </li>
<li><strong>‘Iddah (waiting period):</strong> Only women have to suffer the hardships of 'Iddah. For example, only a wife has to mourn the death of her husband for 4 months and 10 days and cannot marry, while a husband is not required to mourn a single day if the wife dies, and he can enjoy other wives and dozens of slave women the same night. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The origin lies directly in pre-Islamic Arab culture and Muhammad copied it from them</span>. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/31-%E2%80%98iddah-waiting-period-is-illogical-injustice-against-women">Link</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ila (الإيلاء):</strong> In Talaq, a woman gets her freedom and can marry another man. But in Ila (الإيلاء), a man abstains from having any sexual relationship with her wife (as a punishment) for 4 months. Then he can have sex with her, and then again leave her alone for the next 4 months. Ila was essentially a tool wielded by husbands to punish and to manipulate their wives into complying with their demands. Women were treated as mere possessions. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The origin lies directly in pre-Islamic Arab culture and Muhammad copied it from them</span>. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/9-ila-another-islamic-ruling-to-oppress-the-woman-in-matters-of-divorce">Link</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Zihar:</strong> If a Muslim man, in a fit of anger or unintentionally, compares his wife to his mother or her back to his mother's back, it becomes necessary to separate her, akin to a divorce. Only women suffered badly from it. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The origin lies directly in pre-Islamic Arab culture. Muhammad made it a part of Islamic Sharia too and this useless practice is part of Sharia even today</span>. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/84-the-drama-of-revelation-in-the-case-of-zihar-divorce-by-referring-to-wife-as-mother">Link</a>. </li>
<li><strong>The process of 3 Talaqs:</strong><sub> </sub>The process of 3 Talaqs is again there to punish a woman in the name of reconciliation. Only a woman suffers under it where she is forced to stay in the husband's house as a captive for about 3 months. He is allowed to have sex with other wives and dozens of slave girls, but the poor woman is forced to have no sex and love during this period of 3 Talaqs. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The origin lies directly in pre-Islamic Arab culture and Muhammad copied it from there</span>. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/7-the-process-of-3-talaqs-in-islam-is-again-unjust-towards-women">Link</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Rape of Slave Women in Temporary Sexual Relationships: </strong>Raping slave women is an evil. But Islamic evil goes beyond this where it allows raping them in "Temporary Sexual Relationships". When a Muslim owner had fulfilled his lust by raping slave girls and got bored of them, he simply sold them in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery and bought for himself dozens of new slave girls. It was not done out of any 'necessity', but only for the 'sexual pleasure' of Muslim men. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Remember, the bible (i.e. Jews and Christians) doesn't allow any "Temporary Sexual Relationship" with slave girls. Muhammad rejected the law of Moses (i.e. the Bible) and copied it only from his pre-Islamic Arab culture</span>. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity#mozTocId787024">Link</a>. Muhammad also allowed two Muslim owners to swap their slave girls and rape them. Muhammad also allowed a Muslim owner, if he got lust for the slave wife of his male slave, then he could separate them, and take her for himself. And after fulfilling his lust, he returned her to her husband (i.e. his male slave).<sub> </sub></li>
<li><strong>Raping Captive Women &amp; Virgin girls and even Minor girls the same night</strong>: Muhammad allowed his Jihadist companions to draw sexual pleasures from captive women, and to rape virgin girls and even minor girls the same night, although the Jihadists had killed their fathers, brothers, husbands and sons during the daytime. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Remember, the Bible prohibited this practice and ordered to give captive women 1 month to mourn the killing of their family members. Muhammad once again rejected the Sharia of Moses and took this practice directly from his pre-Islamic Arab culture.</span> <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity#mozTocId981200">Link</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Separating babies from the slave mothers and selling in the Bazaars of Slavery</strong>: Muhammad allowed Muslim owners to separate babies (when they get their first 2 molar teeth at the age of about 6 months) to be separated from their slave mothers, and to be sold in Islamic Bazaars of Slavery. Rich men bought those baby girls from Bazaars and used them for sexual pleasers. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity#mozTocId878447">Link</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Hijab:</strong> It was an old Arab Culture that only women of high-status families had the right and honour of wearing the Hijab, but slave women and prostitutes didn't. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Muhammad also took this practice from his old Arab culture</span>, where<span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span>he prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab and even kept their breasts NAKED in public<span style="color: #0000ff;"> (<span style="color: #ff0000;">as he again took this practice from his Arab culture</span>)</span>. Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat slave women with a stick and removed their Hijab by telling them not to try to resemble Free Muslim women by wearing the Hijab. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women/37-women-and-hijab/11-islam-prohibited-slave-women-from-wearing-the-hijab-or-even-covering-their-naked-breasts-in-public">Link</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Islamic Nikah:</strong><sub> </sub>A man buys the rights of a woman in the name of Haq Mahr (dowry). A man takes SEXUAL Pleasure (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B9">تمتع</a>) from her, and reserves her vagina solely for himself, While the husband is free to marry other women and to have sexual relationships with dozens of slave women. Mahr is the payment of those sexual services, which she is obliged to provide to her husband on DEMAND. She is forced not to go out of home without her husband's permission, she is not allowed to raise her voice, and her husband is allowed to beat her in every matter in the name of disciplining her. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The origin lies directly in pre-Islamic Arab culture and Muhammad copied it from there</span>. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-general/232-marriage-conditions-muhammad-copied-pre-islamic-arab-customs-like-haq-mahr-and-women-getting-the-right-to-divorce-through-agreement">Link</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Liaan (Accusation of Adultery)</strong>:<sub> </sub>A Husband Can Accuse His Wife of Adultery Without Any 4 Witnesses, but if a Wife Accuses Her Husband of Adultery (or Rape) and She Does Not Produce 4 Eyewitnesses, Then She Will Be Lashed 80 Times.<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;">It was not even a part of misogynist Arab culture, but this ruling was an additional <strong>NEW</strong> invention by Muhammad</span></span>. <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/22-liaan-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86-a-husband-can-accuse-his-wife-of-adultery-without-any-4-witnesses,-but-if-a-wife-accuses-her-husband-for-adultery-or-rape-and-she-does-not-produce-4-eye-witnesses,-then-she-will-be-lashed-80-times">Link</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Foster father marrying his adopted minor daughter:</strong><sub> </sub>If a man gets a LUST for his minor adopted daughter due to her beauty or wealth, then Islam allows the foster father to forcefully marry her. It started when Muhammad denied any bond between foster parents and adopted children when he married the wife of his adopted son Zayd. This opened the gate for Muslim men to marry their adopted daughters too according to Sharia.<span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">It was not even a part of misogynist Arab culture, but this ruling was an additional <strong>NEW</strong> invention by Muhammad</span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">.</span>  <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/marriage-rape-of-minor-girls/21-marriage-minor-adopted-daughter-with-foster-father-in-islam">Link</a>. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">ORIGINS</span> of Islamic MISOGYNY:</h2>
<p>Islamic misogyny finds its roots in the historical context of ancient Arab culture, particularly within the Meccan Tribe of Muhammad.</p>
<p>To gain insight into the prevalence of misogyny in Arab culture, let us explore the perspective of Umar Ibn Khattab.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2468">2468</a>:</p>
<p>.... (Umar said): We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the <strong>upper hand over their men</strong>, so our (Meccan) women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. <strong>Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back</strong>.  She said, 'Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) retort upon him,<strong> and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night</strong>.' <strong>What she said scared me</strong> ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please note that misogyny was not confined to Mecca but was also prevalent in Medina. Ansar women faced challenges due to the influence of misogynistic elements in ancient Arab culture. In Medina, men practiced polygamy and, to some extent, mistreated women, although the severity was not as pronounced as the mistreatment that escalated after the advent of Islam, as indicated in a Hadith narrated by 'Aisha (<a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5825/">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5825</a>).</p>
<p>However, the misogyny within Muhammad's Meccan tribe (Quraysh) reached an even higher level. According to Umar Ibn Khattab:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a woman responded loudly to her shouting husband, it was considered alarming behavior by the misogynistic men of Quraysh.</li>
<li>Similarly, if a woman chose to remain silent for even a single day after a dispute, she was also deemed to have a negative character in the eyes of the misogynistic men of Quraysh.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Muhammad considered Ansar women not <span style="color: #ff0000;">Worthy</span> to be Married due to the <span style="color: #0000ff;">Misogynist Influence </span>of his tribe<span style="color: #0000ff;">:</span></h2>
<p>Muhammad contracted marriages with 11 women, several of whom belonged to his Quraysh tribe. Islamic apologists argue that these unions primarily served political purposes, aiming to fortify alliances with various tribes.</p>
<p>Despite the political necessity for strong ties with Ansar tribes in Medina, Muhammad curiously did not marry any Ansar women.</p>
<p>When queried about the absence of marriages with Ansar women, Muhammad attributed it to their perceived jealousy, asserting that they were women prone to intense jealousy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3233">Sunan Nasai, Hadith</a> <a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3233">3233</a>:</p>
<p><span class="arabic_sanad arabic">عَنْ أَنَسٍ، قَالُوا يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ أَلاَ تَتَزَوَّجُ مِنْ نِسَاءِ الأَنْصَارِ قَالَ ‏</span> <span class="arabic_text_details arabic">"‏ إِنَّ فِيهِمْ لَغَيْرَةً شَدِيدَةً </span></p>
<p>It was narrated from Anas that they said: "O Messenger of Allah, why don't you marry a woman from the Ansar?" He said: "<strong>They are very jealous</strong>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The situation with Ansar women was not that they opposed polygamy. Indeed, they accepted it as it aligned with the prevailing Arab misogynistic culture, and Ansar men commonly practised polygamy, as illustrated in the Hadith where an Ansari man offered to divorce one of his wives to marry her to his Muhajir brother (<a href="https://www.islamicity.org/hadith/search/index-dev.php?q=ansar&amp;tag=1&amp;&amp;sss=1">Sahih al-Bukhari 3781 (Book 63, Hadith 6) #3609</a>).</p>
<p>However, Ansar women were more assertive in voicing their objections to the perceived injustices of their husbands, which made Muhammad uneasy and afraid of them. That is why Muhammad blamed them for being jealous and didn't marry them. </p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 24px;"><strong>Lesson:</strong></span></h2>
<p>This issue of misogyny in Islam proves that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islam gives rights to women neither based on <strong>equality</strong> nor based on <strong>justice/equity</strong>.</li>
<li>And no divine Allah is residing in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelations on his own. However, being just a human, he was inevitably susceptible to the impact of human behaviour and prone to making human errors.</li>

			<title>Islamic Logic: Wives betray their husbands due to Eve</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>حَدَّثَنَا بِشْرُ بْنُ مُحَمَّدٍ، أَخْبَرَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ، أَخْبَرَنَا مَعْمَرٌ، عَنْ هَمَّامٍ، عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم نَحْوَهُ يَعْنِي ‏ “‏ لَوْلاَ بَنُو إِسْرَائِيلَ لَمْ يَخْنَزِ اللَّحْمُ، وَلَوْلاَ حَوَّاءُ لَمْ تَخُنْ أُنْثَى زَوْجَهَا ‏”‏‏.‏</p>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:<br>The Prophet (S) said, “If it was not for the Israelites, meat would not decay. And if it was not for Eve, wives would never betray their husbands.”<br><a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/60/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saheeh Bukhari – Chapter: The creation of Adam and his offspring</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>وَحَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ رَافِعٍ، حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الرَّزَّاقِ، أَخْبَرَنَا مَعْمَرٌ، عَنْ هَمَّامِ بْنِ مُنَبِّهٍ، قَالَ هَذَا مَا حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ، عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَذَكَرَ أَحَادِيثَ مِنْهَا وَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ “‏ لَوْلاَ بَنُو إِسْرَائِيلَ لَمْ يَخْبُثِ الطَّعَامُ وَلَمْ يَخْنَزِ اللَّحْمُ وَلَوْلاَ حَوَّاءُ لَمْ تَخُنْ أُنْثَى زَوْجَهَا الدَّهْرَ ‏”‏ ‏.‏</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah’s Messenger said: Had it not been for Bani Isra’il (the Israelites), food would not have become stale, and meat would not have gone bad; and had it not been for Eve, a woman would never have acted unfaithfully towards her husband.<br><a href="http://sunnah.com/muslim/17/84" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saheeh Muslim – Chapter: Were it not for Hawa’ (Eve), no female would ever betray her husband</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the peak of irrationality. </p>
<p>Even if we assume the Islamic story of Adam and Eve to be true, .... and even if we assume that ONLY wives betray their husbands (while vice versa is not true), still the conclusion by Allah/Muhammad is false, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wives don't betray their husbands due to Eve,</li>
<li>And even when they betray them, then it is only due to Satan (even according to Islam's logic). </li>
<li>And the proof for this is that husbands also betray their wives, but Muslims don't blame Adam for their crimes, but they blame Satan for the wrong-doings of husbands. </li>
</ul>
<p> As usual, Islam apologists again came to defend it too. Islamweb.Net is one of the largest Islamic Fatwa websites, and it presented the following excuse for this hadith (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/245617/had-it-not-been-for-bani-israel-meat-would-not-decay-">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Hadeeth is authentic; it was recorded by <span style="color: maroon;">Al-Bukhari</span> and <span style="color: maroon;">Muslim</span>. As regards its meaning, <span style="color: maroon;">An-Nawawi</span> said about the interpretation of the saying of the Prophet : "Had it not been for Hawaaa' (Eve), women would never betray their husbands.” Al-Qaadhi said: “The meaning of this Hadeeth is that she was the mother of the daughters of Aadam; so they resembled her, and they <strong>inherited </strong>from her what happened to her in the account of the tree with Iblees (Satan) - he seduced her into eating from the tree and lured her, so she told Aadam about the tree and, as a result, he ate from it.....”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explanation is even worse than the hadith itself. </p>
<p>None of the women "<strong>inherited</strong>" this characteristic to betray their husbands from Eve.</p>
<p>No child inherits such characteristics as telling a lie, telling the truth, betraying etc. from his/her parents. </p>
<p>And finally, there are also men who are unfaithful to their wives. Have they inherited it from Adam? </p>
<p> </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>Muhammad accused women to be deficient in intelligence. This accusation brought a lot of hardships for women, and they were deprived of their testimonies (either partial or even full) in almost all cases. </p>
<p>Due to the highly insulting nature of Muhammad's accusation, which went against human intellect, present-day Islamic apologists find themselves compelled to make various weak excuses in defence of Muhammad.</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p> </p>
<h2>The First Excuse: "نقص" does not mean "deficiency", but "reduction in legal responsibilities":</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Although Muslim Translators of Sahih Bukhari (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304">Mohsin Khan</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060223202814/https://bewley.virtualave.net/bukhari4.html#6">Aisha Bewley</a>) used the words "<span style="color: #2100ff;"><em>deficient in intelligence</em></span>", but modern Islamic apologists claim that actual translation is "<span style="color: #2100ff;"><em>reduced in mind</em></span>", which they further claim to mean "<span style="color: #2100ff;"><em>reduced burden of legel responsibilities</em></span>". </span></p>
<p>Thus, modern Islamic apologists present the translation by Abu Amina Elias, and claim it to be the correct transaltion of this Hadith, which uses the words "reduction in mind".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.abuaminaelias.com/women-deficient-reason-religion/">Sahih Bukhari, 298</a> (Translated by Abu Amina Elias):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: O gathering of women! Give in charity, for I have seen you as a majority of people in Hellfire. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">They said, “Why is that, O Messenger of Allah?” The Prophet said: You curse others often and you are ungrateful for your livelihood. </span>I have not seen anyone with<strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> <span style="color: #ff0034;">reductions in mind and religion</span> <span style="color: #2100ff;">more capable of removing reason from a resolute man than you.</span> </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They said, “What are our reductions in mind?” The Prophet said: </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Is not the testimony of a woman like half of a man? </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They said, “Of course.” The Prophet said: </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">That is the reduction in your mind. </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Is it not that when you menstruate you do not pray, nor fast? They said, “Of course.” The Prophet said:<strong> </strong></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">That is the reduction in your religion.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After doing this translation, the modern Islamic apologists further assert<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> (<a href="https://www.abuaminaelias.com/women-deficient-reason-religion/">link1</a> &amp; <a href="https://the-clear-message.com/are-women-deficient-in-intellect-and-religion/">link2</a>):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This demonstrates the profound significance of the word “نقص” to which some scholars have interpreted it in this hadith to mean: “<strong>reduction in (legal) responsibilities.</strong>” Therefore, in the context of two women being required as witnesses, it signifies a shared responsibility of bearing witness instead of it being solely entrusted to one individual. Thus, there is a <strong>reduced burden</strong> <strong>(in legal) responsibilities</strong> when compared to a single male witness.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response:</strong></span></p>
<p>Whatever translation we use, the "<span style="color: #2100ff;"><em>context</em></span>" of the Hadith makes it completely clear that Muhammad meant that "women are deficient in intelligence", while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad is here clearly talking in the context that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>despite</strong></span> women being <strong>"reduced in mind"</strong>, they are <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>yet</strong></span> able to remove reason from resolute men and make them go crazy, who are superior both in intelligence and religion. Therefore, it is evident that Muhammad meant "deficiency in intelligence" in this context.</li>
<li>Otherwise, it would make no sense for Muhammad to tell women that <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">despite</span></strong> <strong>"reduction of burden in legal responsibilities"</strong>, they can <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>yet</strong></span> sweep away the mind of a resolute man and make them go crazy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, Islamic apologists are able to fabricate lame excuses on their own, but they still have to solve this riddle first, how can "reduction of legal responsibilities" enable women to remove reason from resolute men and make them go crazy? </p>
<p>Moreover, the Quranic verse (Quran 2:282) clearly states that the reason for requiring two women as witnesses is not a "reduction of burden in legal responsibilities," but because the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) believed that women often "<span style="color: #ff0034;"><strong>err</strong></span>" due to their lack of intelligence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/2.282?Context=3" rel="nofollow">Quran 2:282</a>:</p>
<p>O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man <strong>and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women <span style="color: #ff0034;">errs</span>, then the other can remind her</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, the contradiction arises when Islamic apologists assert that two female witnesses are required to reduce their burden, while the Quran itself states that two female witnesses are needed because women often "err" according to its writer.</p>
<p>This leads to a significant question: Why are Islamic apologists contradicting their own Quran by making such a claim?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Second Excuse: Women "err" due to their non-involvement in business/debt contracts</h2>
<p>After the Quran refuted the first excuse of "reduction of legal responsibilities" and acknowledged women's propensity to "err," Islamic apologists put forth their second excuse, asserting that Allah is correct in recognizing women's propensity to make mistakes. They claim (<a href="https://www.abuaminaelias.com/women-deficient-reason-religion/">link</a>). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of testimony, <strong>women in early Islam did not customarily involve themselves in business contracts, debts, and other matters.</strong> They were usually doing other important work, caring for their children and elderly parents, and so on. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response: </strong></p>
<p>Firstly, it is worth noting that many men and 14-year-old boys also never involve themselves in financial matters in their lives, yet the testimony of these 14-year-old boys is considered "full."</p>
<p>Secondly, even if an uneducated man engages in financial matters (and has no prior experience in business contracts), his testimony is still counted as full. In contrast, even if an educated and experienced woman takes part in financial matters, her testimony remains half. This distinction is due to Muhammad's belief that women err due to their deficiency in intelligence.</p>
<p>Thirdly, even if we assume that Muhammad reduced women's testimony to half in financial matters because they had less experience in such issues, he still allowed them to own and manage their wealth. Perhaps, Muhammad had to allow this because Khadija (his first wife) owned wealth and supported Muhammad with her wealth. The point is, if women can look after their wealth and finances all the time and make all the decisions themselves, then they can also become witnesses in financial contracts for others.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it is not only in financial matters but also in cases of murder, fornication, divorce, etc., that Islam does not accept a woman's testimony at all (i.e., in these matters, Islam does not accept even half a testimony from a woman, but considers her testimony as "zero"). Thus, the issue here is not about "experience," but according to Islam, it is about women being "deficient in intelligence."</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A woman's testimony is considered as <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">half</span> <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">ONLY</span> in <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">financial</span> matters, and it is entirely <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">Null</span> in serious cases such as killings, rape, fornication, etc.</h2>
<p>There is a widespread misunderstanding that women's testimony is universally accepted as half in all cases within Islam. However, the reality is much worse, as women have been severely degraded by the writer of the Quran (i.e., Muhammad).</p>
<ul>
<li>In specific matters of relatively lesser significance (like in Financial Matters), a woman's testimony is accepted as half.</li>
<li>A woman's testimony is considered as full in specific matters related to her body or personal affairs, where men lack firsthand knowledge and have to rely on women's testimony.</li>
<li>However, when it comes to serious cases, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud" style="font-size: 1rem;">Hudud</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> punishments (like rape, robbery, murder etc.), a woman's testimony is </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">completely disregarded</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> and considered as </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">ZERO</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></li>
<li>Similarly, in all other cases unrelated to a woman's body or affairs, her testimony is also entirely rejected, including matters like Nikah (marriage), Talaq (divorce), Raju' (restitution of conjugal rights), <a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/9-ila-another-islamic-ruling-to-oppress-the-woman-in-matters-of-divorce" style="font-size: 1rem;">Ila (الإيلاء)</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> (a husband's vow to abstain from his wife), </span><a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/84-the-drama-of-revelation-in-the-case-of-zihar-divorce-by-referring-to-wife-as-mother" style="font-size: 1rem;">Zihar</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> (a form of divorce), Apostasy, parentage, </span><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%88%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9_%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9" style="font-size: 1rem;">al-Wakalah</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, will-testaments, and more.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for this discrimination against women's testimony is not as Islamic apologists claim, which is to reduce their responsibility or due to their lack of experience in these fields. Instead, it is solely because the writer of the Quran (i.e., Muhammad) considered women to be deficient in intelligence.</p>
<p>Contrastingly, men's testimony is accepted as full right from the beginning, even in cases where they have no experience, such as rape, theft, robbery, Nikah, divorce, etc. This disparity is based on the notion that women are intellectually inferior, perpetuating discrimination against them in the legal system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a case of Zina (adultery), where testimony of four people is needed, and women could not be included in those 4 witnesses (i.e. they all should be men). Quran say:</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=24&amp;verse=4">24:4</a>:</p>
<p>وَٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُوا۟ بِأَرْبَعَةِ <em><strong>شُهَدَآءَ</strong></em> فَٱجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَٰنِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلَا تَقْبَلُوا۟ لَهُمْ شَهَٰدَةً أَبَدًا ۚ</p>
<p>Translation: And those who accuse the chaste women, then not they bring four (male) witnesses <em><strong>(Arabic شُهَدَآءَ, which is genitive masculine plural noun)</strong></em>, then flog them (with) eighty lashe(s) and (do) not accept their testimony ever.</p>
<p>... And there are few cases where testimony of only 2 people is needed, but women are not included in them (i.e both witnesses should be men). These cases are of Hudud and Qisas, for example cutting hands for stealing, drinking alcohol, Hirabah (i.e. treason), and <em><strong>all Islamic scholars agree upon it</strong></em>.</p>
<p>And then there are cases, (which are not about woman's body and affairs, and thus) men could get direct information about them, and they are also not about the financial matters. These cases are like Nikah, Talaq, Raju' [restitution of conjugal rights], Ila (الإيلاء), Zihar, Apostasy, parentage, al-Wakalah, will-testaments etc., then according to <em><strong>majority of Fuqaha</strong></em> (Islamic jurists) testimony of 2 men is needed, but women are not included in it.</p>
<p>And a proof for it lies in this Quranic <strong>verse of divorce</strong> too:</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=65&amp;verse=2">65:2</a>:</p>
<p>فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُوا۟ ذَوَىْ<em><strong> </strong></em>عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلشَّهَٰدَةَ لِلَّهِ ۚ</p>
<p>Translation: Then when they have reached their term, then retain them with kindness or part with them with kindness. And take witness two <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>men</strong></span> <em><strong>(</strong>Arabic ذَوَىْ accusative masculine dual noun<strong>)</strong></em> just among you and establish the testimony for Allah.</p>
<p>And also, proof is found in the Quranic <strong>verse of</strong> <strong>will-testament</strong>:</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=5&amp;verse=106">5:106</a>:</p>
<p>يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ شَهَٰدَةُ بَيْنِكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ حِينَ ٱلْوَصِيَّةِ ٱثْنَانِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ أَوْ ءَاخَرَانِ مِنْ غَيْرِكُمْ إِنْ أَنتُمْ ضَرَبْتُمْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَأَصَٰبَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ ۚ تَحْبِسُونَهُمَا مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِٱللَّهِ إِنِ ٱرْتَبْتُمْ لَا نَشْتَرِى بِهِۦ ثَمَنًا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ ۙ وَلَا نَكْتُمُ شَهَٰدَةَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّآ إِذًا لَّمِنَ ٱلْءَاثِمِينَ</p>
<p>Translation: O you who believe! (Take) testimony among you when approaches one of you [the] death, (at the) time (of making) [the] a will two <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>men</strong></span> <strong><em>(</em></strong><em>Arabic ٱثْنَانِ: nominative masculine dual noun</em><strong><em>)</em></strong>, just, among you, or two other <strong>men</strong> <em>(Arabic اخَرَانِ: nominative masculine dual noun)</em> from other than you if you (are) travel(ing) in the earth then befalls you calamity (of) [the] death. Detain both of them from after the prayer and let them both swear by Allah if you doubt, "Not we will exchange it for a price even if he is (of) a near relative, and not we will conceal testimony (of) Allah.</p>
<p>And about Nikah (marriage) too, the holy prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p>( لا نكاح إلا بولي وشاهدي عدل )</p>
<p>Translation: Nikah could not be held without the guardian and<strong><em> 2 male witnesses</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This tradition has been recorded by Imam Bayhiqi.</p>
<p>While Imam Malik narrated from Imam Zuhri:</p>
<p>مضت السنة بأنه لا تجوز شهادة النساء في الحدود ولا في النكاح والطلاق</p>
<p>Translation: It has been a regular practice according to Sunnah <em><strong>that testimony of women is not accepted in Hudud, Nikah and Talaq</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, all the Quranic Verses (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=24&amp;verse=4">24:4</a> regarding adultery, <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=65&amp;verse=2">65:2</a> regarding Talaq and <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=5&amp;verse=106">5:106</a> regarding will-testament) demand only males as witnesses.</p>
<p>Please read our detailed article: <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/women-general/women-s-testimony-is-not-even-half-but-zero-in-serious-hudud-cases">The Testimony of a Woman Is Not Accepted (Not Even as Half) in Serious Hudud Cases such as Rape, Robbery, Murder, etc.</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The reason for depriving women of their testimonies: Muhammad discriminated against people based on their STATUS</h2>
<p>Muhammad considered women to be of lower status compared to men, as evident in Quran 4:34</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.34">4:34</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ٱلرِّجَالُ قَوَّٰمُونَ عَلَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَآ أَنفَقُوا۟ مِنْ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ</p>
<p>Men stand superior to women in that God hath preferred some of them over others, and in that they expend of their wealth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse demonstrates Muhammad's belief in the superiority of men over women, based on God's preference.</p>
<p>Moreover, Muhammad's discrimination extended beyond gender. He also deprived slaves, including male slaves, and non-Muslims of their testimonies, considering them to be of lower status than free Muslims.</p>
<p class="western">Imam Shafii wrote in his book “Ahkam-ul-Quran, vol 2, page 142 (<a href="https://answering-islam.net/BehindVeil/btv4.html">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">And the testimony should be from the free men, and not from the <em><strong>slaves</strong></em>. Similarly, these free men should be the follower of our religion (i.e. they should be Muslims), while the testimony of <em><strong>non-Muslims</strong></em> free men is not accepted</blockquote>
<p class="western">Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd writes in his Fiqh Book (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160117184347/http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/RISALA.htm">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">ولا تجوز شهادة المحدود ولا شهادة عبد ولا صبي ولا كافر</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">The testimony of someone who has been given a fixed punishment, or of a <em><strong>slave</strong></em>, a minor or a <em><strong>Kafir</strong></em>, is inadmissible.</blockquote>
<p>A male slave and a male Kafir didn't suffer from deficiency of memory and intelligence according to Muhammad, but it is their lower status which Muhammad used in order to discriminate against them and deprive them of their testimonies.</p>
<p>Even many Muslim Scholars also openly admitted that women are deprived of their testimonies, while they are lower in Status. </p>
<p>For example, Hafidh Zubair Zai is a well-respected Salafi Hadith Master. He writes under the commentary of this Hadith (<a href="https://islamicurdubooks.com/hadith/hadith_.php?vhadith_id=371&amp;bookid=1&amp;zoom_highlight=%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%AF+%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%B4%D9%8A+3122">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This authentic Hadith indicates that men have a general superiority over women. This is also confirmed in the Noble Quran:</p>
<p>"Men are in charge of women." [Surah An-Nisa: 34]</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2>Depriving slave women their testimony led to their rape and their inability to get any justice</h2>
<p class="western">Some people used to force their slave girls into prostitution.</p>
<p class="western">When those slave girls complained to Muhammad,<em><strong> he didn't punish their owners for compelling them to fornication</strong></em>. </p>
<p class="western">But the question is: Why didn't Muhammad/Allah punish those owners for compelling their slave women to do prostitution?</p>
<p class="western">The answer is: The witness of slave women is no acceptable in Islamic courts. </p>
<p class="western">This incident is present in the Quran itself.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/24.33">24:33</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">Sunnan Abu Dawud, Kitab-ul-Talaq (<a href="http://www.hadithurdu.com/03/3-2-547/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">Musaykah, a slave-girl of some Ansari, came and said: My owner forces me to commit fornication (in order to earn money from it). Thereupon the following verse was revealed: <em>"(Quran 24:33) And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful."</em></blockquote>
<p>Actually, slaves are absolutely not allowed to go to court against their owners in any matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, a slave girl could cry as much as she can about her rape, but her witness is not accepted in any Islamic court, which makes it impossible that her owner can be punished for such heinous crimes as forcing them into prostitution.</p>
<p>That is why, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad), at maximum, <strong>ONLY</strong> Recommended the owners not to force the slave women into fornication, <strong><em>but he was unable to punish the owners for forcing their slave girls into prostitution.</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Third Excuse:  Women's testimony is half, while they are emotional</h2>
<p>Muhammad accused women of having lower memory and low intelligence. In addition to this, some Muslim apologists added another allegation, stating that women's testimony is rejected in serious <em>Hudud</em> cases or considered half valid in financial matters because they are emotional and prone to making mistakes while testifying due to their emotions.</p>
<p>However, this claim by Muslim apologists lacks concrete evidence. In non-Muslim countries, there is a vast amount of data containing testimonies from <strong>several million</strong> women, and nowhere is it suggested that women's emotional nature leads to significant mistakes in their testimonies.</p>
<p>Therefore, Muslim apologists should refrain from making baseless assumptions about women's ability to testify accurately based solely on their emotions. Instead, they should provide <strong>scientific studies</strong> that support their claim.</p>
<p>Please also note that the question is not about whether women experience emotions or not, but the question is whether women are emotional to <strong>Such an <span style="color: #ff0000;">EXTENT</span></strong> that they start giving false testimonies. Thus, Islamic apologists don' have to bring those studies which merely say that women are emotional, but they have to bring those scientific studies which prove women to be emotional to this EXTENT where the disadvantages of their testimonies outweigh the advantages due to their being emotional.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Fourth Excuse: Women become less intelligent during menopause </h2>
<p>Islamists also claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are scientific studies which tell that women become less intelligent and may have<strong> </strong>cognitive decline duing menses and menopause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>This excuse does not work while Muhammad didn't limit his statement to menopause only, but he meant in general that women are at all times deficient in intelligence, and all the time making resolute men go crazy. </p>
<p>Moreover, this cognitive decline is not to such an extent where they start giving false testimonies.  Thus again, Islamic apologists don' have to bring those studies which merely say that women are emotional, but they have to bring those scientific studies which prove women to be emotional to this EXTENT where the disadvantages of their testimonies outweigh the advantages due to their being emotional.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Fifth Excuse: 'Aisha's witness was considered as full in the case of Hadith</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists also make this excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Muslims unanimously accept 'Aisha's testimony as full in the case of Hadith. This serves as evidence that Islam does not consider women deficient in intelligence or memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Even though the testimony of a woman like 'Aisha is considered full in the case of Hadith, the credit for this recognition does not belong to Islam. Instead, it was the <span style="color: #1d00ff;"><strong>circumstances</strong></span> that practically  "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">compelled</span></strong>" Muslims to accept the testimony of women as full in Hadith.</p>
<p>Allah (i.e. Muhammad) did not leave behind any organized book on many subjects, such as Sharia rulings, Sunnah (practices of Muhammad), and history etc. Numerous incidents, especially those occurring inside the house of Muhammad, had no male witnesses, and only his wives witnessed those events. Similarly, there were various Fiqh issues concerning women, where once again, only Aisha and other wives of Muhammad were the witnesses, as Muhammad failed to communicate those matters to any man directly. As a result, during the time of Muhammad and even after his demise, women would approach 'Aisha and other wives to seek answers to those issues, and they were answering them in the light of Muhammad's Hadith. </p>
<p>In this situation, the only available source was the Quran, which is not only extremely vague but also useless for life's practical issues. For example, there are not even 1% of Sharia Rulings present in the Quran. The whole Quran is mainly filled with praises of Allah's power and some ancient tales.</p>
<p>Thus, Muslims were practically "compelled" to admit the testimony of 'Aisha, as they had no other way to know the rulings about many issues.</p>
<p>Similarly, NATURE also clearly contradicted Muhammad's opinion that women are inferior in intelligence and memory. 'Aisha possessed a remarkable memory and could recall incidents and rulings without error. Her natural ability and intelligence left Muslims with no excuse to deny her testimony in the case of Hadith.</p>
<p>However,  when it will come to any financial matter, then these same Muslims will make 'Aisha's testimony to be half (again blaming her to be deficient in intelligence and making errors). And also 'Aisha's testimony would be reduced to  ZERO by these same Muslims in Hudud's cases of drinking wine, rape, stealing, robbery, or even in cases of divorce, Nikah and will-testament' and start blaming her to be too "emotional" to give testimonies in these cases. Yes, 'Aisha may be emotional, but not to the EXTENT that she starts "erring" in her testimony. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The sixth Excuse: The Prophet didn't mean All Women, but Only the Women of the Ansar Tribes</h2>
<p>Islamist apologists also claim that the Prophet didn't mean all women in this Hadith, but only the women of the Ansar (<a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM6NRmAMX/">link</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Reply:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, there is absolutely no mention of Ansar women, but this hadith is clearly addressing all women. No one stopped Muhammad from openly taking the name of Ansar women in the Hadith. </p>
<p>Secondly, even millions of Muslim scholars of the past 14 centuries themselves never claimed that Muhammad meant only the women of Ansar. There is only one present-day Sufi Islamic scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Metwalli_al-Sha%27rawi">Sheikh Sha'arawi</a>, who made this excuse for the first time. But again, he was unable to present any proof for this claim. </p>
<p>Thus, the CONJECTURES of Islamic apologists hold no value, but they have to come with solid proof. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The seventh Excuse: But later coming few Zahiri Scholars indeed accepted the witness of Women</h2>
<p>An Islamic apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn al-Qayyim, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ib Qudamah agreed that witness of a woman is accepted and can be equal to a man</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Firstly:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All above mentioned Islamic Scholars (i.e. Ibn Qudamah, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim) belong to the later coming "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahiri_school">Zahiri</a>" sect of Islam. </li>
<li>And they came <strong>only 600 years </strong>after Muhammad. This means, they claimed that the whole Salaf (early) Ummah of the <strong>first 600 years</strong> got <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>unanimously misguided</strong></span> on this issue, and indeed the witness of a woman is acceptable and equal to a man. </li>
<li>Even after them, only a handful of Muslims followed them, while the remaining Muslim Ummah kept on denying the witness of a woman. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Secondly:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>They failed to bring a single Quranic Verse which proves that women are allowed to witness in cases of Hudud cases etc. </li>
<li>They failed to bring a single Hadith of Muhammad, where he allowed any free or slave woman to testify in the cases of stealing, fornication, rape, robbery, drinking, Nikah, divorce, will-testament etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>If Allah truly exists and possesses knowledge of the "<strong>Unseen</strong>" about the future, and He knew that for the next 14 centuries, the entire community would continue to make this mistake,</li>
<li>And If Allah really knew that due to this mistake, hundreds of thousands of women and slave women are going to suffer as their witnesses are going to be denied in almost all cases except for some minor issues like financial matters etc. </li>
<li>Then why didn't Allah reveal a clear verse in the Quran specifying that the witness of a woman is accepted in all Hudud cases and is equal to a man's witness? </li>
</ul>
<p>The Quran is a voluminous book, but Allah filled it with boasting about His grandness and powers, some old stories, and tales.</p>
<p>Why didn't Allah have the capability to straightforwardly present the commandments of Sharia in a scholarly manner so that countless innocent women and slave girls wouldn't fall victim to injustice?</p>
<p>The only logical conclusion drawn from all this is that there is no all-<strong>Knowing</strong>, all-<strong>Wise</strong>, 100% <strong>Perfect</strong> and <strong>Flawless</strong> Allah above the heavens. Instead, it was Muhammad himself who was formulating the Sharia. And since Muhammad was just a human and not 100% perfect, and he didn't possess knowledge of the future "Unseen," we are left with a Sharia that is full of imperfections and human errors.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fourthly:</strong></span></p>
<p>Actually, it proves that Allah/Quran made a false promise. </p>
<p>The Quran claims that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its verses are "easy to understand" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/54.17">54:17</a>)</li>
<li>Its verses are "clear", "manifest" and "guidance" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2">27:1-2</a>)</li>
<li>It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.2">12:2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the question is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #e67e23;">Why did those billions of Muslims of the first 14 centuries still get misguided?</span><span style="color: #169179;"> </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #169179;">They firmly believed firmly in this Quran from the depth of their hearts.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #843fa1;">They read it day and night</span>.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ba372a;"><span style="color: #0f02ff;">They pondered upon it their entire lives. </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But if they still misunderstood it, and got misguided, then it is not the fault of those billions of Muslims of the last 14 centuries, but it becomes the fault of the Quran itself. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Islam contains dozens of Misogynist claims regarding Women</h2>
<p>Please don't see Muhammad's claim of "deficiency of intelligence" in women in isolation, but there exist dozens of such MISOGYNIST clams in Islam. For example: </p>
<ol>
<li>Women are deficient in intellect, their testimony is worth half</li>
<li>Women inherit half, or often far less</li>
<li>Women can be raped as slaves</li>
<li>Husbands can unilaterally marry more women and dozens of slave girls.</li>
<li>Women can't lead prayers</li>
<li>Women can't travel alone</li>
<li>Women aren't fit to be leaders</li>
<li>Women "come in the shape of the devil"</li>
<li>Women are the majority inhabitants of hell (and no, more men are born than women so the number of souls based on birth is majority men)</li>
<li>Women can't marry christian men but men can</li>
<li>Women are burdened with far higher control of clothing and sexuality</li>
<li>Menstruation is unpure</li>
<li>You can beat your wife</li>
<li>Women are ungrateful to their husbands</li>
<li>Women's laugh, scent, sound of her shoes is zina</li>

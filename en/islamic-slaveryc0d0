			<description><![CDATA[<p>Islamic Slavery has perpetrated abhorrent crimes against humanity. However, what is even more disheartening is the widespread ignorance surrounding these issues. Islamic preachers have cunningly concealed the atrocities from the general populace (including Muslims). If only people could become aware of these matters, the inherent compassion within us would triumph in this battle against Islam.</p>
<p>Yes, a lot of ex-Muslims have left Islam due to this issue of Islamic Slavery.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><br><big><big>Table of Contents:</big></big></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">{index}</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Here is the timeline for the abolishment of slavery (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230331224715/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_slavery_timeline">link</a>). You can see more than 200 major movements against slavery in the whole world throughout history, but you will hardly find a single significant movement in an Islamic country against slavery in this long list.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Why?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Because Muslims consider that Allah made slavery Halal (i.e. permissible) in His Islamic Sharia, and no man has the right to declare that thing Haram (i.e. prohibited), which Allah made Halal.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">According to the Saudi Mufti (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saleh_Al-Fawzan">link</a>), the prohibition of slavery is considered temporary. It is believed that once an Islamic State is established, it is obligated to engage in offensive warfare, known as Jihad, against non-believers (kuffar). As a result, prisoners of war, including women and children, may be taken and eventually enslaved. Consequently, the institution of slavery would be reinstated with the establishment of an Islamic State.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId787024"></a>Islam permitted MULTIPLE Muslim men to rape a slave girl one by one in <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">TEMPORARY</span> sexual relationships  </h2>
<p>Even the Jews and the Christians treated slave women better than Muhammad. They didn't allow MULTIPLE men to rape a slave woman, but Muhammad indeed allowed MULTIPLE Muslim men to rape a slave girl in a TEMPORARY sexual relationship. Muhammad actually left the Laws of Moses from the Bible in this case, and he took the laws of his Arab culture (of the era of Ignorance) and made them a part of his newly made Islamic Sharia. He did so, while those Arab laws regarding slave girls brought more materialistic benefits to Muhammad and his followers. </p>
<p>Allowing a Muslim owner to rape a prisoner/slave woman was itself a great crime of Islam against humanity. But Islam went even further and it dishonoured the poor captive/slave girl in one of the worst possible ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, Islam allowed the master to rape the slave girl (against her will). </li>
<li>Then, after fulfilling his lust, the master was allowed to hand her over to any of his brothers or slaves (against her will). </li>
<li>And after <strong>all of his brother and slaves had raped her and fulfilled their lust one by one</strong> in a <strong>TEMPORARY</strong> sexual relationship (like of Mut'ah in Shia Islam), she was sold to the 2nd master in the Islamic Bazaar of slavery, while the 1st master bought a new slave girl and started raping her. </li>
<li>And the 2nd master raped her again and then sold her to the 3rd master in the slave market. Thus, the cycle of rape of the poor slave girl continued.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sahih Muslim, Kitab-ul-Nikah (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140719221709/http://sunnah.com/muslim/16/147">link</a>), Sahih Bukhari, Kitab-ul-Qadr (<a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/82/9">link</a>), Sahih Bukhari, Kitab-ul-Tauheed (<a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/38">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>0 Abu Sa'id al-Khadri said: We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; <strong>and we desired (to have sex with) them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but we also desired good ransom money by selling them). So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing 'azl </strong>(i.e. withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception so that they don’t become pregnant and could be sold for good ransom money). But then we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, <strong>and he said: (Yes, it is allowed, but) it does not matter if you do it or not, while if any soul has to be born up to the Day of Resurrection, then it will be born</strong>.</blockquote>
<p><sub><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Note</strong></span>: Initially, Muhammad described 'Azl (withdrawal during intercourse) as equivalent to <strong>burying a child alive</strong>. However, he later changed it and allowed it for his companions, in order to accommodate their sexual desires and financial interests. However, that was a huge <strong>contradiction</strong>. Thus, in the end, when Muhammad stated, "...whether you practice it or not, if a soul is destined to be born, it will be born," then it was his justification to cover up that contradiction. For more details, you can explore the full discussion <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/divine-revelation-or-a-human-drama/350">here</a>. <br></sub></p>
<p class="western">Moreover, Muhammd also allowed an owner to hand over the slave girl one by one to his brothers or slaves or even to guests in temporary sexual relationships. </p>
<p class="western">Tafsir Dur-e-Manthur, under the commentary of verse <a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;tSoraNo=23&amp;tAyahNo=6&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=2&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">23:6</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">وأخرج عبد الرزاق عن عطاء قال: كان يفعل يحل الرجل وليدته لغلامه، وابنه، وأخيه، وأبيه، والمرأة لزوجها، ولقد بلغني أن الرجل يرسل وليدته إلى ضيفه.</p>
<p class="western">Abd al-Razzaq narrated on the authority of Ata’ that he said: It is a <strong>common practice</strong> that a man would made <strong>his slave girl Halal (permissible) to his slave, son, brother, and father</strong>. And the woman (made her slave girl permissible) to her husband.  Indeed, I have heard that <strong>a man would send his slave woman to his guest</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Islam also allowed the master, if he got lust for the wife of his male slave, then he could snatch away the wife from his male slave and rape her, thus destroying the whole slave family. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67" data-ve-attributes="{&quot;rel&quot;:&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot;}">Sahih Bukhari, Book of Nikah:</a></p>
<p>[ (25) Chapter: "Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters..."]:</p>
<p>وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.</p>
<p>Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. <strong>But there is no problem if a man (i.e. the owner) takes his (married) female slave (for himself) from his male slave.</strong></p>

<p>And Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani wrote in his commentary of Sahih Bukhari (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/52/9335/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8%D9%83%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%83%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%87%D9%86">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وفي رواية الكشميهني جارية ( من عبده ) وصله إسماعيل القاضي في كتاب " أحكام القرآن " <span style="color: rgb(186, 55, 42);"><strong>بإسناد صحيح</strong></span> من طريق سليمان التيمي عن أبي مجلز عن أنس بن مالك أنه قال في قوله تعالى والمحصنات : ذوات الأزواج الحرائر <a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; list-style: none; font-family: 'Lotus Linotype'; outline: none 0px !important; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.5s linear 0s, background 0.5s linear 0s; color: rgb(0, 45, 106); font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal;" href="https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/52/9335/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8%D9%83%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%83%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%87%D9%86#docu"><span class="quran">إلا ما ملكت أيمانكم </span></a>فإذا هـو لا يرى بما ملك اليمين بأسا أن <span class="mainsubj">ينزع الرجل الجارية من عبده فيطأها </span></p>
<p>In the narration of Al-Kashmihani, there is a mention of a slave girl (who was wed with the male slave) that Isma'il al-Qadi included in his book "Ahkam al-Quran" with an <span style="color: rgb(186, 55, 42);"><strong>AUTHENTIC</strong></span> chain of transmission through Sulaiman al-Taymi from Abu Majliz from Anas ibn Malik. Anas ibn Malik commented on the verse "And the married women" (in the Quran), saying it refers to free women with husbands, except for those whom your right hands possess (i.e., slave women). <span style="color: rgb(186, 55, 42);"><strong>He explained that there is no issue if an owner takes a slave girl, who is a wife of his male slave and has intercourse with her</strong></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that all married women are forbidden, but if a female slave of any person is married to a male slave, then it is not forbidden for the owner to separate the married female slave from her husband, and take her for himself.</p>
<p>Unbelievable!</p>
<h2>Even the Bible dealt with slave women much better than Islam</h2>
<p>There are verses in the Bible which tell that Moses and other prophets killed the men, and took the women for themselves (just as Muhammad killed all the captive men, along with 12 years old male children, and took all the women as slaves). </p>
<p>But after the women have already been captured, the Bible treats them much more humanely and with respect as compared to Allah/Muhammad. </p>
<p>Bible didn't allow the owners to rape and selling of the captive/slave women again and again after a temporary sexual relationship like in Islam, but they stipulated that:</p>
<ul>
<li>An owner is only allowed to "marry" the slave woman.</li>
<li>Once married, the status of the slave woman becomes similar to that of a permanent wife.</li>
<li>Such a slave woman cannot be handed over as a sex object to the owner's brothers or male slaves.</li>
<li>She cannot be sold to another owner after a temporary sexual relationship; rather, she automatically gains her freedom.</li>
<li>And of course, the bible didn't allow the owner to snatch away the wife of his slave, start her rape, and thus destroy the whole family of his slave. </li>

<p>The "religious morality" of Judaism and Christianity also had flaws, as they allowed the taking of captive women as slaves. However, this concept of "religious morality" took an even worse turn with the arrival of Islam.</p>

<h2>Why did Muhammad leave the laws of Moses, and followed the laws of ignorant polytheist Arab society?</h2>
<p>Jews themselves were present in al-Madina, and Muhammad was well aware of the rulings regarding captive women in Judaism. However, Muhammad neglected the Laws of Moses and followed the laws of the polytheist Arab society, which were more ignorant and cruel.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The answer is simple. </p>
<p>The laws of ignorant Arab culture brought more “Financial Benefits” to Muhammad, where he and his followers not only got sexual pleasures by raping the captive/slave women but also made much more money by selling them after the rape. Indeed, this additional money and sexual pleasures came at the expense of subjecting enslaved women to the most severe form of cruelty.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to remember that these unfortunate captive or enslaved women were completely innocent and played no role in the wars. Despite their innocence, Muhammad did not spare them and instead exploited them for his personal gain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this demonstrates that the so-called "religious morality" took a significant turn for the worse in this instance. This single fact alone is sufficient to understand that Muhammad was a false prophet. It is worth noting that according to his claims, Allah is believed to be 100% perfect and free from making any mistakes. Therefore, if Allah is found to have made even a single mistake, the entire foundation of his ideology is automatically undermined.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this single fact is enough to recognize that he was himself fabricating revelations in the name of a non-existent Allah.</p>
<h2>Allah(i.e. Muhammad) allowed Jihadists to take sexual services from the captive women the first night, although they had killed their fathers/brothers/husbands and sons on the same day</h2>
<p>This is the 1400 years of history of Islam, where they killed the men in the day, then took all their women and small girls as captives. They didn’t even allow them to weep upon the killing of their relatives, and Islamic Jihadis (warriors) started raping the small girls and the young virgin girls, the same night (including penetration into their vaginas).</p>
<p>To comprehend the distress endured by those captive women as a result of the loss of their loved ones, one has to look at this tradition.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/TabariVolume08/page/n145/mode/2up?view=theater">History of Tabari, Volume 8, Page 122</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Ishaq said: After the Messenger of God conquered al-Qamus, Safiyyah bint Huyayy was brought to him, and another woman with her. Bilal (a companion), who was teh one who brought them,<strong> led them past some of the slain Jews. </strong>When the woman who was with Safiyyah saw them<strong>, she cried out, struck her face, and poured dust on her head. </strong>When Messenger of God saw her, he said,<strong> "Take this she-devil away from me!"</strong> ... The Messenger of God said to Bilal, when he saw the Jewish woman doing what he saw her do,<strong> "Are you devoid of mercy, Bilal, that you take two women past their slain men?"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now imagine, what a distress it would have been for those poor women and small girls when Muslim Jihadists had also started raping them and forcing them to provide the sex-services, while they were in that state of mind, where they were crying and mourning the killings of their fathers, husbands and sons?</p>
<p>Which crime could be greater against humanity than this crime of Islam?</p>
<p>Islamic apologists come up with the excuse that perhaps this tradition of the History of Tabari is weak. But they should realize that this excuse is not going to work, while it is a "<strong>Universally Acknowledged Truth</strong>" that after the killing of relatives in the war, all women naturally find themselves in a state of grief and sorrow and crying and mourning. Furthermore, another universally recognized truth is that Muslims indeed raped them and forced them to provide sex services the very first night.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Bible (Jews and Christians) did not permit such extreme cruelty towards captive women. Instead, they demonstrated compassion by allowing these women a full month to mourn their lost relatives before considering marriage. This approach does not absolve them of the act of taking captives as slaves, but it does highlight their comparatively more humane treatment of captive women than Allah(/Muhammad).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An Excuse by Muslim Apologists: </strong></span></p>
<p>Muslim Apologists present this excuse that Muslim men (Jihadists) didn't touch captive women the same night, but waited and gave them time of up to one month (first monthly period) before touching them. And it was also enough for those women to mourn the killings of their fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons.</p>
<p><strong>Our Response:</strong> This is not true. And the reality is as under:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the captive was a virgin girl, then she was raped (with penetration) the same night by Jihadists. They didn't even spare minor girls, as it was a normal practice of Sahaba to rape them the same night too (as you will read later the details later in this article).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a captive woman (who already had a husband), became free of her blood the same day, then she was again raped the same night (as it happened with Saffiyah, who became free of her blood the same day, and Muhammad slept with her the same night).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And there also exists opinion of Islamic scholars that only PENETRATION is not allowed till captive women become free of their first monthly period, however Jihadists were totally free to take all other types of sexual services from them (like undressing them, kissing their bodies, making them to masturbate them etc.)</p>
</li>

<p>The Risala is a famous treatise of Maliki fiqh (jurisprudence). It says the same i.e. virgin woman (including virgin minor girls) don't need any waiting period and can be raped immediately. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/lawbase/risalah_maliki/book33.html">The Risalah, 33:5 (Maliki Fiqh)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Istibra' is observed in the case of a slavegirl who changes ownership. It is one menstruation. Ownership changes by selling, giving away, capture, or any other way. If the woman menstruates after being in the possession of the new master (i.e. she was a minor girl) before he has bought her, then <strong>she does not have to observe an istibra' if she has not gone out</strong>. The istibra' for a child when she is sold is three months as it is for a woman who no longer menstruates. <strong>There is no istibra' for a woman who has never had intercourse</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, please also see the traditions later in this article, where Ali and other Sahaba raped minor (virgin) girls without any waiting period. </p>
<p>Islamic apologists cannot claim that this opinion of Islamic scholars is not a part of Islamic Shariah. No, but all these different opinions are part of Islamic Shariah, as all of them were practised in the name of Islam, while Allah forgot to reveal the Sharia Ruling clearly in the Quran. Allah filled this fat book (Quran) with boasting of his strength and threatening non-believers with eternal torment of hell fire, and some old stories, but forgot to reveal a single clear verse in the Quran about captive women to save them from this torture.</p>
<h3 class="text-24 xs:text-20">Logical Question: Were Jihadists ANGLES that they were able to control themselves?</h3>
<p>Some ancient societies, such as those under <strong>Cyrus the Great</strong> or the <strong>Qin and Han dynasties of China</strong>, placed captive women under <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>state ownership</strong></span>. While these women were later subjected to <strong>forced labor</strong>, they were at least <strong>spared from immediate sexual violence</strong> on the first night or afterward.</p>
<p>Muhammad had the opportunity to implement a more humane approach. He <strong>could have placed captive women under state protection</strong>, ensuring they were not violated. However, he instead <strong>distributed them in <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">private owndership</span> </strong>of his Jihadist warriors as private property <strong>on the same day</strong>. Once given away, these women (along with minor girls)—<strong>bound with ropes—were entirely at the mercy of their new owners</strong>.</p>
<p>The logical question is: <strong>Were the jihadist warriors of the past 14 centuries angels?</strong> Did they possess such <strong>absolute self-control</strong> that they refrained from touching the captive women (and minor girls)—<strong>bound and helpless</strong>—for an entire month, despite being alone with them under the same roof?</p>
<p>Captive women were not only bound with ropes, but their upper garments were also removed and their chests, hairs, face and remaining body parts were also exposed, except for the area between navel and the knee (You will read details about it later in the 2nd part of this article: <a class="mod-articles-category-title " href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/46-islam-no-hijab-for-slave-women-and-their-breasts-naked-in-public">NO Hijab for Slave Women and their Breasts NAKED in public</a>). Islam removed the upper garments of captive/slave women in order to differentiate them from Free Muslim women. So, they were alone in that semi-naked state with Jihadists under one roof. </p>
<p>Remember the incident when <strong>Muhammad initially prohibited</strong> his companions from having intercourse with their wives <strong>for the 30 nights of Ramadan</strong>, allowing intimacy only between <strong>Maghrib </strong>(evening prayer)<strong> and ‘Isha</strong> (night prayer). However, the <strong>Sahaba were unable to restrain themselves</strong>, and no divine command could stop them from going to their wives at night. Even <strong>Umar ibn Khattab</strong> was among those who broke the restriction.</p>
<p>Since punishing all of them was impractical, <strong>Muhammad introduced a new revelation</strong>—<strong>Quran 2:187</strong>—declaring that <strong>Allah had now permitted them to have intercourse throughout the nights of Ramadan.</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>Also, remember how the <strong>Sahaba</strong> went to <strong>Muhammad</strong>, expressing their inability to <strong>control their desires</strong> after spending just a few nights in war <strong>without their wives</strong>. They asked for <strong>permission to be castrated</strong> to suppress their urges (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4615">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4615</a>). In response,<strong> </strong>Muhammad permitted them to engage in Mut'ah (temporary marriage) as a solution.</p>
<p>Therefore, the question remains: <strong>Were the millions of jihadists over the past 14 centuries truly angels?</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, according to <strong>Islamic Shariah</strong>, a <strong>slave woman had no right to testify</strong> against her owner in an Islamic court. This meant that even if a jihadist <strong>violated her before she completed one menstrual cycle</strong>, she had <strong>no legal recourse</strong> to complain or seek justice.</p>
<h2>Looking and touching the private parts of half-naked slave women in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery</h2>

<p>The 1400 years of history of Islam also consists of this shameful act against humanity, where Muslims forced those women/girls to become half naked by exposing their breasts, and then forced them to stand in front of thousands of men in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, who not only looked at them with lust but they were also allowed to touch their private parts (as if they were sheep and goats).</p>

<p>Is this <strong>degradation of the slave woman</strong> what Islam considers <strong>true modesty</strong>? Is this the <strong>"perfection"</strong> that the Quran claims in <strong>(Quran 5:3)</strong>: <em>"This day I have perfected for you your religion"</em>?</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<h2>The Evil of "Slavery by Birth" in Islam</h2>
<p>Not only were the children of <strong>enslaved parents</strong> automatically born into slavery, but even if a <strong>free Muslim man</strong> married a <strong>slave woman owned by someone else</strong>, their children would still be considered <strong>the property of the woman's owner</strong>. This is why the <strong>Quran discourages free men</strong> from marrying slave women owned by others, as their offspring would <strong>automatically inherit the status of slavery</strong>.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/25/default.htm">4:25</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And whoever among you has not within his power ampleness of means to marry free believing women, then (he may marry) of those whom your right hands possess from among your believing maidens; and Allah knows best your faith: you are (sprung) the one from the other; so marry them with the permission of their masters ... <strong>This (permission of marrying a slave woman) is (only) for him among you who fears falling into evil (i.e. fornication); but still if you abstain (from marrying a slave woman) is better for you (while your children will be automatically born as slaves), and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>وقوله تعالى { ذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِىَ ٱلْعَنَتَ مِنْكُمْ } أي إنما يباح نكاح الإماء بالشروط المتقدمة لمن خاف على نفسه الوقوع في الزنا، وشق عليه الصبر عن الجماع، وعنت بسبب ذلك كله، فله حينئذ أن يتزوج بالأمة، وإن ترك تزوجها، وجاهد نفسه في الكف عن الزنا، فهو خير له لأنه إذا تزوجها، جاء أولاده أرقاء لسيدها، إلا أن يكون الزوج غريباً، فلا تكون أولاده منها أرقاء في قول قديم للشافعي، ولهذا قال { وَأَن تَصْبِرُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ } ومن هذه الآية الكريمة، استدل جمهور العلماء في جواز نكاح الإماء على أنه لا بد من عدم الطول لنكاح الحرائر، ومن خوف العنت لما في نكاحهن من مفسدة رق الأولاد، ولما فيهن من الدناءة في العدول عن الحرائر إليهن،</p>
<p>The Quran says ذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِىَ الْعَنَتَ مِنْكُمْ  (This permission of marrying slave girl of other person is for him among you who is afraid of falling into fornication;) means that marrying slave girls of other people is permissible for those who fear falling into adultery and don't have the patience to abstain from ZINA (adultery). However, it is better to refrain from marrying slave girls and to observe patience, for otherwise,<strong> the offspring will become slaves to the girl's master </strong>...  ... Many scholars have used this verse to argue that it is only permissible to marry a slave woman if one does not have access to free women and is afraid of falling into sin <strong>because on one hand the offspring will become slave to the girl's master, and on the other hand Muslim men will become more interested in slave women only, and take no interest in free Muslim women</strong>. </p>

<p>However, a pressing question arises: <strong>Even if Islam couldn’t abolish slavery outright, why didn’t it at least grant enslaved parents the right to keep their children with them?</strong> Would a ban on <strong>separating infants from their mothers</strong> really have <strong>collapsed the economy of the mighty Islamic empire</strong>?</p>
<p class="western">Thus, one of the biggest evils of Islam was "<strong>Slavery by Birth</strong>". All the children of slave men and women were automatically born as slaves (except in this case when the father was the owner himself). </p>
<p>Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (also known as the younger Imam Malik) wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf">link 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117184347/http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/RISALA.htm">link 2</a>):</p>

<p class="western">The anguish experienced by a mother is indescribable when her six-month-old baby is forcibly taken away from her and sold in the slave market.</p>
<p class="western">Even the slave mothers of the owner's own children (i.e. أم الولد) were also not exempt from this cruelty. They too were separated from their children and sold in the slave markets, leaving behind a trail of heartbreak and despair. </p>

<p>Once again, we witness the distressing separation between parents and children, with the only distinction being that in this case, it is the mothers who are being sold instead of the babies.</p>
<p>This is the grim reality that unfolded over the course of 1400 years in Islamic history. A history marred by the tragic separation of countless babies from their slave mothers, who were then traded and sold in the desolate slave markets.</p>
<p class="western">One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery_in_Islam">link</a>):</p>

<h2 id="bwholefamilyofslavewasatthemercyofownerb">The whole family of a slave was at the mercy of the owner:</h2>
<p class="western">In Islam:</p>
<ul>
<li>The slaves were deprived of the freedom to marry and establish families of their own. They remained entirely dependent on the mercy of their owners for having a wife.</li>
<li>If a slave man or woman dared to marry without the owner's consent, it was deemed as an act of fornication punishable by severe consequences.</li>
<li>Even in instances where an owner displayed kindness by arranging a marriage between their slave man and woman, the owner retained the power to dissolve the family unit at any time, reclaiming the wife for personal sexual use.</li>
<li>The owner possessed the authority to dismantle a slave mother's family structure, separating the baby from its mother and selling the child in the slave market at approximately six months of age (after the appearance of two molar tooth).</li>
<li>Furthermore, the owner had the right to sell the slave father even before the birth of the child. The unfortunate slave father had no right to even lay eyes on his own offspring.</li>
<li>Typically, owners would selectively pair their slave women with healthy and young slave men to ensure the birth of healthy slave babies, subsequently fetching higher prices in the slave market. This parallel can be observed on cattle farms, where a robust bull is chosen to mate with multiple cows in order to produce healthy calves for profit. In this set-up, normally old owners handed over their slave girls to a healthy slave man so that he could rape those slave girls. After the birth of the healthy babies, those old owners again took the slave women back for themselves and started fulfilling their sexual lusts by raping them.</li>
</ul>
<p class="western">These were the advantages that led Muhammad to overlook the laws of Moses and incorporate the customs of the uncivilized Arab society into Islamic Sharia.</p>

<h2>Buying slave babies/minor girls from slave markets and raping and taking sexual pleasures from them</h2>
<p>And Sharia allows a Muslim man to buy a slave baby/minor girl from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, undress her, kiss her naked body, and take all other sexual pleasures, and rub his penis in her thighs to ejaculate. And if she is 6 or 7 years old, and the owner thing she is strong enough, then he can also penetrate in her vagina. </p>

<p>There’s no issue in the sexual kissing, thighing..etc of a minor wife, even if she can't yet endure sexual intercourse.

<p>Ali raped a minor slave girl on the same night when she was made captive after the war.</p>
<p><a href="https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2">Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967</a>:</p>

<p>Narrated Buraydah: <br>I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave girl). We said: "O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!" Ali replied: "Did you not see the slave girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, <em><strong>and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.</strong></em>" ...<br><strong>Grading: </strong>Classed <strong><em>Sahih</em></strong> by al-Arna'ut</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ولم ير الحسن بأسا أن يقبلها أو يباشرها. وقال ابن عمر ـ رضى الله عنهما ـ إذا وهبت الوليدة التي توطأ أو بيعت أو عتقت فليستبرأ رحمها بحيضة، ولا تستبرأ العذراء. وقال عطاء لا بأس أن يصيب من جاريته الحامل ما دون الفرج.</p>
<p>Al-Hasan did not see any harm in kissing or having sexual intercourse with a female slave. Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: "If a female slave who has been engaged in sexual intercourse is given as a gift, sold, or freed, she should be purified by waiting for her menstrual cycle. <strong>However, a virgin does not require purification (i.e. the minor girls are also virgins)</strong>."  And Atta said if a slave woman had become pregnant (from the earlier owner/husband),<strong> then still pleasure could be derived from whole of her body, except for her vagina</strong>.</p>

<p>WikiIslam.Net also recorded more traditions on this issue <a href="https://wikiislam.net/index.php?title=Rape_in_Islamic_Law&amp;mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop#Waiting_period_before_sex_with_slave_girls_too_young_to_menstruate">here</a>. </p>
<p>Try to envision the tragic plight of these young girls who are enslaved, and it will undoubtedly send shivers down your spine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, Allah/Muhammad separated the small child girl from her mother and sold her in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery.</li>
<li> Then this young girl finds herself all alone in the unfamiliar residence of her new owner, entirely dependent on his mercy.</li>
<li>And when the new owner begins to start raping her, one can only imagine the immense trauma experienced by that little child girl.</li>
<li>Furthermore, if this new owner happens to be a psychopath who also brutally tortures her along with raping her, then that slave girl faces an even more devastating situation. Undoubtedly, she would have longed for her slave parents, but their absence left her without any means of finding protection from this harrowing ordeal.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the situation where a free minor girl is married, there is a possibility that her father may choose to postpone the consummation of the marriage until she is physically mature enough (as was the case with 'Aisha, whose marriage was consummated at the age of 19). But in the case of a slave baby/minor girl, then she is purely at the mercy of her master. It is her master who will decide when she has become strong enough for penetration. If he deems her strong enough at the age of 5 or 6 years, then no one can stop him from doing it. </p>
<p>If indeed there exists any God, could he ever bring such disgrace upon humanity?</p>
</div>
<p>Regrettably, religious Muslims have relinquished their humanity and shame as a result of religious indoctrination. Astonishingly, they emerge to still defend Islam for committing the most heinous crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>This was the practice of Muhammad and his followers for the last 1400 years, until the secular non-religious West emerged as the saviour, putting an end to these wicked acts of slavery.</p>

<h2>Swapping of slave girls is also Halal Allah (permissible)</h2>
<p>The evil of "<strong>Temporary"</strong> sexual relationships with slave girls in Islam also led to another evil, where the swapping of slave girls also became Halal Allah. If a Muslim man got lust for a slave girl of another person, he can simply offer that other man to swap their slave girls for rape. </p>
<p>Tafsir-e-Mazhari is a commentary of the Quran, which is taught in every Hanafi school. It is written under the commentary of verse 33:52 (<a href="https://sachaai.com/images/swap_slave_girls_mazhari.jpg">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Zayd said about this verse {وَلَآ أَن تَبَدَّلَ بِهِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجٍ nor to exchange your present wives for other women (<a href="https://quranx.com/33.52">Verse 33:52</a>)} that people used to swap their wives during the era of ignorance ... upon that Allah revealed this verse and the swapping of wives is thus not allowed. <strong>But the slave women are not included in it, and you can swapp them and there is no issue in it</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in a case, if the owner got lust for the wife of his male slave, then even this swap was not needed. And the owner could simply take the wife of his slave for himself, and used her for sexual services.</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, Book of Marriage (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161214063714/https://www.sunnah.com/bukhari/67/43">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">Companion Anas Ibn Malik said: The meaning of the verse (وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ Surah Nisa) is this if a slave girl of any owner, is in a marriage of his slave man, then there is no issue if the owner take her back for himself (to have sex with her) from his male slave.</blockquote>

<h2>2 to 5 Official Fathers of a child (due to her rape in <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">TEMPORARY</span> sexual relationships in Islam)</h2>
<p>If there were two or more joint owners of the slave women, then Islam allowed those joint owners to rape her one by one. They only had to wait for 3 (to 7) days in between, so that the slave woman became free of her menstruation blood, and after that next owner was allowed to start raping her.</p>
<p>But this caused doubts in many cases that who was the real father of a child. Normally a child is born after 9 months of pregnancy. However, in some cases, the delivery may take place within 6 months, or it may exceed 9 months. </p>
<p>Thus, Muhammad adopted this solution where both those 2 (or more) joint owners became the <strong>Combined Official Fathers</strong> of the child.</p>
<p>Imam Ibn Qadamah wrote in his book Al-Mughani (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221101084210/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;flag=1&amp;bk_no=15&amp;ID=5562">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وإذا كانت الأمة بين شريكين فوطئاها لزمها استبراءان</p>
<p>And if a slave woman is shared between two partners and both have intercourse with her, she must observe two waiting periods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is written in Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, vol. 6, page 162, Urdu edition (<a href="https://sachaai.com/images/two_official_fathers_slave.jpg">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If two men have joint ownership of a slave woman, and a child is born, and both claimed the parentage of the child, then both will be the (official) fathers of that child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this same Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, vol. 6, page 173, Urdu edition (<a href="https://sachaai.com/images/five_official_fathers_slave.jpg">link</a>), it has been written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imam Abu Hanifa said: If a slave woman is in joint ownership of 3 or 4 or 5 men, and all of them claimed the parentage of the child, then all of them will be his (official) fathers ... Imam Muhammad (Hanafi) has stated in the Ziyadat that if a slave woman is shared between two men, and she gives birth to a child six months or more after they became her owners, and then gives birth to another child six months or more after the first child's birth, then if one of the owners claims that the younger child is his and the older child belongs to his co-owner, and if the co-owner confirms this, then the lineage of the younger child will be established from the claimant, and the slave woman will be considered the mother of the child (Umm Walad) belonging to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fatawa-e-Alamgiri is an authentic Fiqh book of Hanafi jurisprudence and has been taught in all the Hanafi Madaris (religious schools) of the Indian Sub-Continent (i.e. Pakistan/India/Bangladesh).</p>
<h2>A master has the authority to deny the parentage of his own child, declare him an illegitimate Bastard and make his own child a slave</h2>
<p>If there were two or more joint owners of the slave women, then Islam allowed those joint owners to rape her one by one. They only had to wait for 3 (to 7) days in between, so that the slave woman became free of her menstruation blood, and after that next owner was allowed to start raping her. But this caused doubts in many cases that who was the real father of a child. Normally a child is born after 9 months of pregnancy. However, in some cases, the delivery may take place within 6 months, or it may exceed 9 months.</p>
<p>Mohammad devised a solution wherein the owner had the privilege to deny the parentage of his own child, thus declaring the own child to be an illegitimate BASTARD (Arabic: Walad-ul-Haram). The child would then become the slave of his father, and then the father could sell him/her in the slave market and make money. </p>

<p>أنَّ رسولَ اللَّهِ صلَّى اللَّهُ عليهِ وسلَّمَ قَضى أنَّ كلَّ مُستَلحقٍ يُستَلحَقُ بعدَ أبيهِ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ ، ادَّعاهُ ورثتُهُ من بعدِهِ ، فقَضى : إن كانَ من أَمةٍ يملِكُها يومَ أصابَها فقد لَحقَ بمنِ استلحقَهُ ، وليسَ لَهُ فيما قسمَ قبلَهُ منَ الميراثِ شيءٌ ، وما أدرَكَ مِن ميراثٍ لم يُقسَمْ ، فلَهُ نصيبُهُ ، ولا يَلحقُ إذا كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ أنكرَهُ ، وإن كانَ من أَمةٍ لا يملِكُها ، أو من حرَّةٍ عاهرَ بِها ، فإنَّهُ لا يَلحقُ ولا يرثُ ، وإن كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ هوَ الَّذي ادَّعاهُ ، وَهوَ ولدُ زنًا لأَهْلِ أمِّهِ ، من كانوا ، حرَّةً ، أو أمةً</p>
<p>"The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ruled that every child belongs to the one who claims him after his father. His heirs can claim him after his death. He ruled that if the child belongs to a slave whom he possessed on the day the child was born, then the child belongs to the one who claimed him, and he has no share in the inheritance that was divided before his claim. However, he will have a share in any remaining inheritance that has not been divided. But if the father to whom he is attributed denies him (i.e. his parentage), the the child will not joined to the heirs. If the child belongs to a slave whom he does not possess, or to a free woman with whom he committed adultery, then the child will not join the heirs and will not inherit him, even if the one to whom he was attributed is the one who claimed paternity, since he was a child of fornication whether his mother was free or a slave.</p>

<p>The subsequent crime against humanity was that Islam made that innocent child suffer in Islamic society in the name of being an illegitimate Bastard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islam came up with an Islamic Terminology (Walad-ul-Haram ولد الحرام) for them (meaning Bastards).</li>
<li>These children were prohibited from bearing their fathers' names and were instead compelled to be identified solely by their mothers' names, marking them easily recognised as illegitimate bastards and subjecting them to humiliation within society.</li>
<li>Furthermore, they were denied any inheritance rights from their fathers.</li>
<li>If the child is a girl, then she is a non-Mahram for her father and stepbrothers and therefore she can never get fatherly love, nor brotherly love from her stepbrothers.</li>
<li>All four Fiqh Imams (Malik, Abu Hanifa, Shafi'i, and Ahmed bin Hanbal) concur that an illegitimate child is not permitted to lead congregational prayers (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200108132848/https://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/PrintFatwa.php?lang=E&amp;Id=88469&amp;lang=E&amp;Id=88469">Reference: Biggest English Fatwa Website Islamweb.org.

<p>This level of injustice from any God is just unbelievable. </p>
<h2 class="western">It was not incumbent upon the Owners to marry their slaves, and if they married on their own, then it became fornication and punished for it</h2>
<p class="western">An owner may possess dozens of slave girls and may rape dozens of them himself, but still it was not incumbent upon him to marry his male slave to any of his female slaves. Eventually, if any one of them marries on his/her own out of love (or out of necessity), then Islam considers such a marriage to be fornication, for which poor slaves have to be punished with lashes.</p>

<h2>Muhammad and "Slave Trading":</h2>
<p>Allah (i.e. Muhammad) could have at least ended the <strong>slave trade</strong> with the <strong>non-Muslim countries.</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the history of Islam, girls were kidnapped all over the world, and they were brought to the grand Islamic Bazaars of Slavery for trade. </p>
<p>Muhammad also didn't prohibit buying castrated slaves. Thus, boys were castrated, and then sold in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery. </p>
<p>Actually, Muhammad himself sent Jewish captive women of Banu Qurayzah (who believed in the same God as of Muhammad) to the Kuffar (polytheists). He was not worried that Kuffar will rape those poor captive women (who were innocent as they had no role in war). Muhammad traded those poor women for horses and weapons. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Then the Messenger of God sent Sa'd b. Zayd al-Angara (a member of the Banu 'Abd al-Ashhal) with some of the captives from the Banu QurayZah to Najd, and in exchange for them he purchased horses and arms.</p>

<h2>The enslaved men and women were denied the fundamental right to experience "love" and to have "children" </h2>
<p>It is inherent in human nature for individuals, both male and female, to engage in love relationships. Likewise, it is natural for people to desire the formation of their own families and the experience of parenthood by having their own children.</p>
<p>However, Islam defied this fundamental aspect of human nature and stripped away the rights of love and the longing for family and children from enslaved men and women.</p>
<p>Not only was a slave girl denied the right to have a partner whom she could love and had a family, but she was also forbidden from desiring to have children of her own. Instead, her owner was permitted to engage in sexual relations with her and also practice al-'Azl i.e. withdrawing the penis from the vagina and ejaculating outside to prevent pregnancy. This way, the slave girl would not conceive, and the owner could fetch a higher price by selling her to another man. Many Muslim owners also denied children to slave girls, because they wanted to keep on enjoying them by raping them, and a pregnant slave girl was not good enough to provide them with sex services. </p>
<p>In the case of male slaves, Islam did not address their essential human right to love, marry, form a family, and have children. They were entirely dependent on the mercy of their owners. Occasionally, an owner would show compassion by allowing a male slave to have a relationship with one of his slave girls. However, the owner retained the right to dissolve the slave family and reclaim the slave girl for personal enjoyment at any time. Furthermore, the owner had the authority to separate the male slave from his children, either by selling the father or the children in the slave markets.</p>
<h2 class="western">No “Witness” was needed for having sex with the slave girl (even if one is having sex with the slave girl of another person)</h2>
<p class="western">The owner didn’t need to have any “<strong>witness</strong>” for having sex with his slave girl. He could purchase her, and then start raping her.</p>
<p class="western">Unfortunately, this evil didn’t stop there, it went further, as Islam also allowed the owner to present her as a “gift” to any of his brothers or friend or any other person, who was again allowed to rape her against her consent and without any “<strong>witness</strong>”.</p>
<p class="western">Fatawa Alamgiri, vol 3, page 268, Urdu edition (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201101155533/http://www.shiapen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fatwa_alamgiri_v3_p268.jpg">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">A Singular Report is enough on religious issues. Therefore, if a slave woman comes to any person and tells him that her master gifted her to him, then that person can trust that slave girl and have sex with her.</blockquote>
<p class="western">This ruling of Islam was then “misused” by the owners, and they compelled their slave women to engage in sex with multiple men and earn money for their owners through prostitution. We will read the details later in this article </p>
<h2 class="western">Slaves are not human enough to “testify” in the court according to Allah(/Muhammad)</h2>
<p class="western">Although the single witness of a slave woman was enough to have sex with her (i.e. if she comes and tells him that her master made her Halal for him), nevertheless, Allah/Muhammad didn’t even consider slaves as human enough to give their testimony in court in other matters. </p>
<p class="western">Ibn Qaddamah writes in his book al-Mughani (<a href="https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;idfrom=7306&amp;idto=7306&amp;bk_no=15&amp;ID=7183">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">وقال مالك وأبو حنيفة والشافعي وجمهور العلماء : لا تجوز شهادة العبد</p>
<p class="western">Malik, Abu Hanifa, Shafi'i, and the majority of scholars have stated: "The testimony of a slave is not valid." </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">Imam Shafii wrote in his book “Ahkam-ul-Quran, vol 2, page 142 (<a href="https://answering-islam.net/BehindVeil/btv4.html">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">And the testimony should be from the free men, <strong>and not from the slaves</strong>. Similarly, these free men should be the follower of our religion (i.e. they should be Muslims), while the testimony of non-Muslims free men is also not accepted.</blockquote>
<p class="western">Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd writes in his Fiqh Book (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160117184347/http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/RISALA.htm">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">ولا تجوز شهادة المحدود ولا شهادة عبد ولا صبي ولا كافر<br>The testimony of someone who has been given a fixed punishment, <strong>or of a slave</strong>, a minor or a Kafir, is inadmissible.</blockquote>
<p class="western">Please remember that in Islam:</p>
<ol>
<li class="western">There exists a big misunderstanding that the testimony of a free Muslim woman is regarded as a "half testimony". No, but the testimony of a free Muslim woman is also regarded as ZERO in serious “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud">Hudud</a>” cases (like Rape of women, killing, stealing, and robbery). Her testimony is regarded as "half" only and only in the "<strong>financial</strong>" issues. </li>
<li class="western">In contrast, the testimony of slaves was entirely disregarded in any circumstance. It held no value, not even as a "half testimony".  For instance, if a free man assaulted a slave man, the testimony of the slave man or any other slaves who witnessed the crime would not be considered valid.</li>
<li class="western">Similarly, if a free Muslim man sexually molested a slave woman, then neither her testimony was accepted, nor of other slave women who witnessed that crime, nor even of free Muslim women while rape came under “Hudud” cases.</li>
<li class="western">The same is the case with non-Muslim men and women. Their testimonies are also not accepted against any free Muslim man in an Islamic State, while Allah/Muhammad wanted to humiliate them through this.</li>
</ol>
<p class="western">Note:</p>
<p class="western">There is an incident in which Prophet Muhammad accepted the testimony of a slave woman regarding feeding a baby with breast milk. However, according to Salaf Islamic Fiqh Imams, these were considered minor "exceptions" where the testimonies of women, including slave women, could be accepted in specific cases involving private matters related to women. For instance, if a slave woman testified that she was free from menstrual bleeding, her testimony could be accepted in such a case, and her new owner could start having sex with her.</p>
<p class="western">Hence, apart from this one exceptional instance, out of the vast Hadith literature and Quranic verses, there are no recorded incidents where slaves were permitted to provide testimony. Thus, all early Muslims were unanimous that the testimony of slaves is not valid.</p>
<h2 class="western">Forcing slave women into Prostitution, as a source of Income by the owners</h2>
<p class="western">In the Indian Sub-Continent, slave girls were sold in the Diamond Markets. They were trained in dancing and singing. They were also used as sex objects, and the owners used them as a source of income. The origin of this practice also lies in Islam.</p>
<p class="western">There were people who used to force their slave girls into prostitution during the time of Muhammad. When those slave girls complained to Muhammad,<em><strong> then he didn't punish their owners for compelling them to prostitution</strong></em>. </p>
<p class="western">But why didn't he punish them?</p>
<p class="western">The answer is, that the witness of those slave girls was not admissible in Islamic courts. </p>
<p class="western">This incident is present in the Quran itself.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/24.33">24:33</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">Sunnan Abu Dawud, Kitab-ul-Talaq (<a href="http://www.hadithurdu.com/03/3-2-547/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">Musaykah, a slave girl of some Ansari, came and said: My owner forces me to commit fornication (in order to earn money from it). Thereupon the following verse was revealed: <em>"(Quran 24:33) And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful."</em></blockquote>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islam not only allowed the owner to rape the slave girl but also allowed the owner to present her as a gift to any other person, who can then rape the slave girl too against her consent.</li>
<li>And no “Witness” was needed in Islam for having sex with a slave woman (please see the reference above, if a slave woman comes to any person and tells him that her master has gifted her to him, then that person can trust that slave girl and have sex with her).</li>
<li>And the “witness” of a slave woman is not accepted in an Islamic court. Actually, slaves are absolutely not allowed to go to court against their owners. </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, due to these reasons, a slave girl can cry as much as she can about her rape, but her witness is not accepted in any Islamic court, which makes it impossible for the owner to be punished.</p>
<p>That is why, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad), at maximum, only recommended the owners not to force the slave women into fornication, but he was unable to punish the owners for forcing their slave girls into prostitution. </p>
<h2>Slave women were sexually Molested by Sahaba, but Allah/Muhammad neither stopped it nor punished them. Why?</h2>
<blockquote>(Quran <a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=33&amp;vid=59">33:59</a>):</blockquote>
<blockquote>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ذَلِكَ أَدْنَى أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ</blockquote>
<blockquote>O Prophet! tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they let down upon them their over-garments (Arabic: Jilbab) (in order to cover their bosoms and breasts); this will be more proper so that they may be recognised (as free women), and thus they will not be molested (by men)</blockquote>
<p>In the interpretation (Tafsir) of this verse, Islamic scholars such as Abu Malik, Abu Saleh, Muawiyyah, Hassan, Siddi, and Mujahid all wrote that women from the city of al-Madina used to go out of their houses in the evening for various reasons, including using the toilets. Meanwhile, men (specifically the companions of Muhammad) would sit at the edges of the streets and engage in sexual harassment towards these women. As a response to these incidents, this verse regarding the Hijab was revealed.</p>
<p>This verse instructed free Muslim women to cover themselves with a Jilbab (a large outer garment) in order for men to differentiate between free women and slave women, thus protecting the free Muslim women from molestation. Please see <a href="http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;tAyahNo=59&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=1&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">Tafsir al-Tabri (link)</a>, where all these traditions are present.</p>
<p align="left">Ibn Kathir wrote under the Tafsir of this verse (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;tAyahNo=59&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>Here Allah tells His Messenger to command the (free Muslim) believing women to draw their Jilbabs (big outer garment/sheet) over their head and hide their bodies with it, so that they will be distinct in their appearance from the (non-Muslim) women and from the slave women.<br>Siddi said that men used to molest the women who were going on the streets in the nights. Thus, this Hijab became a sign of free Muslim women, so that they could be differentiated from the slave women, and thus men didn’t molest the free Muslim women due to their honour.</blockquote>
<p>More details about this incident of molesting of slave women by men can be read <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/component/content/article/islam-prohibited-hijab-for-slave-women-and-kept-their-breasts-naked?catid=10">here</a>. </p>
<p>It is strange that Allah/Muhammad neither punished those companions, nor rebuked them, nor even stopped them from molesting the slave women. Instead of this, Allah/Muhammad only saved the free women from this molestation by asking them to use the Jilbab. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that Allah/Muhammad usurped the right of 'testimony' from the slave women. They are not even allowed to go to the Courts in an Islamic State and testify against the person who sexually molested them. </p>
<p>Quran is a huge book, and then there are about 1 million Ahadith present there, but Allah/Muhammad forgot to mention the physical punishment for the men who sexually molest the slave women (or even to rebuke them). </p>
<h2>Muhammad's mindset: Recite a prayer when you buy a slave girl, but no need to offer such prayer if you buy a male slave</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunan Ibn Majah, <a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2252">2252</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated"> ... the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "When anyone of you buys a slave woman let him say: 'Allahumma inni as'aluka khairaha wa khaira ma jabaltaha alaihi, wa a'udhu bika min sharriha wa sharri ma jabaltaha alaihi (O Allah, I ask You for the goodness within her and the goodness that You have made her inclined towards, and I seek refuge with You from the evil within her and the evil that You have made her inclined towards).' And he should pray for blessing. And if anyone of you buys a camel then he should take hold of its hump and pray for. blessing and say similar words."</div>

</blockquote>
<p>The slave girl was as much a property as a camel was. This was the mindset of Muhammad. </p>
<h2 class="western">Muhammad ordered the killing of all Old Captives, while they were unable to work as slaves</h2>
<p>Prophet Muhammad commanded the killing of all elderly captives, similar to what occurred in the incident of Banu Qurayzah, regardless of whether they were part of the civilian population or had no involvement in the war. This directive was based on the understanding that these elderly captives were unable to be utilized as slaves, and selling them would not generate any monetary value. Keeping them would have only placed a financial burden on the captor.</p>

<p>Al-Shafi'i, in one of his opinions, and Ibn Mundhir said: It is permissible to kill the elderly based on the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): "Kill the elders of the polytheists but spare their non-adult boys." This hadith is narrated by Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhi, and it is considered a good and authentic hadith. Also, because Allah said: "So kill the polytheists" [Quran 9:5]. And this is a general statement that includes the elderly. Ibn Mundhir said: I do not know any evidence to exempt the killing of the elderly from the general statement: "So kill the polytheists" [Quran 9:5]. Since they are disbelievers and their life has no benefit, they are killed like young adult men.</p>

<p>In every civilization of antiquity, severe punishments awaited slaves who dared to escape the brutalities inflicted upon them by their owners.</p>
<p>Yet, the cruelty and oppression demonstrated by Islam surpassed all others, leaving an indelible mark.</p>
<p class="western">Muhammad implemented a “Double layers System” of oppression, in order to stop the slaves from fleeing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="western"><strong>First Layer:</strong><br>Muhammad allowed the owners to torture the slave, and even to “slaughter” the slave as punishment for fleeing. Jarir (a companion of Muhammad) slaughtered his slave, who tried to flee, but unfortunately got arrested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><strong>Second Layer:</strong><br>Muhammad also used a psychological tactic to stop the slaves from fleeing. He declared that any slave who tries to flee, then Allah will not accept his Prayers, and he will become a Kafir and an Apostate in the eyes of Allah, and he will be burnt in the eternal fire of hell.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If a free Muslim kills another free Muslim, then either he will be killed in retaliation (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qisas">Qisas</a>), or he has to pay the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diya_%28Islam%29">Diya (دية)</a> (i.e. blood money). In case blood money is taken, then no other physical punishment is imposed (i.e. neither any killing in Qisas nor any other lesser physical punishment i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazir">Ta'zir</a>).</p>

<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If a free Musims kills a slave of another person, then he cannot be killed for that, but he only has to pay Half of the Diya (blood money). After the payment of Diya money, there is no other physical punishment (either Qisas or Ta'zir) can be imposed upon him.</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But in case the killer is the owner of the slave, then he does not even have to pay the Diya money.

The loss of the life of his slave (i.e. property) is considered enough fine for him. All 4 Fiqh Imams are unanimous upon this that an owner cannot be punished even if he killed his slave through beating.</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">In case, the slave does not die but only gets mutilated by his owner, then again there is no physical punishment (i.e. neither Qisas nor Ta'zir) that can be imposed on the owner. But he has to free the slave as fine for mutilating him. </li>

<h2>Pregnancy of a virgin slave girl becomes an evidence of her fornication, even if she was raped</h2>
<p>If a free Muslim man rapes a slave girl, then it is impossible to prove his crime, while 4 maile eyewitnesses is needed to charge the rapist (if he is a free Muslim man). But for slave girl:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her master can punish her even on doubts and rumours (false testimony). No court trial is needed, and testimony of slave has no value. </li>
<li>And the pregnancy of a virgin slave girl also becomes an evidence against her for fornication (even if she was raped).</li>
<li>However, the free Muslim rapist will face no chagres, as he neither becomes pregnant nor 4 male eyewitnesses are possible who see the action of sex as khol stick going into kohl container (i.e. penis going into vagina).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Umar declared pregnancy to be enough evidence of adultery and no 4 witnesses are needed. Umar said it in front of companions, but none of them opposed him (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/28539/does-an-unmarried-womans-pregnancy-entail-the-application-of-hadd-of-zina">link</a>):</span></p>

<p>Muhammad himself ordered Ali to flog his slave girl, who became pregnant. </p>
<blockquote>

<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib: A slave-girl belonging to the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) committed fornication (and became pregnant). He (the Prophet) said: Rush up, Ali, and inflict the prescribed punishment on her. I then hurried up, and saw that blood was flowing from her (due to giving birth), and did not stop. So I came to him and he said: Have you finished inflicting (punishment on her)? I said: I went to her while her blood was flowing. He said: Leave her alone till her bleeding stops; then inflict the prescribed punishment on her. And inflict the prescribed punishment on those whom your right hands possess (i.e. slaves).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Please also keep in mind that pregnancy was not a problem for non-virgin slave girls, as their masters were already having sex with them. But pregnancy only became an evidence of fornication in case of "vigin" slave girl. Moreover, the age of losing virginity for slave girls was probably 9 to 11 years in that Muslim society of Muhammad. Thus, Muhammad's  slave girl, who was lashed by 'Ali, if she was charged for adultery due to her pregnancy, then she was most probably not older than 10 or 11 years. </span></p>
<p>In an Islamic society, it was relatively EASY to rape slave girls, as they were not allowed to wear the Hijab, and they had to move in public outside of the house for work, and Muslim men used to often molest them (as it is evident from the verse of the <a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=33&amp;vid=59">Quran 33:59</a> as they were not free Muslim women). And it was even more dangerous for slave girls inside the house, as male members of the family (like father, brother, sons of the owner) had easy access to them and were in commanding position. </p>
<h2>It was almost IMPOSSIBLE for Slave Girls to prove that they were RAPED in case of pregnancy</h2>
<p>Moreover, it was almost impossible for both free or slave women to prove their innocence if they were raped. For example:</p>

<p>Malik said, "The position with us about a woman who is found to be pregnant and has no husband and she says, 'I was forced,' or she says, 'I was married,' is that <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">it is not accepted from her and the hadd is inflicted on her unless she has a clear proof of what she claims</strong> about the marriage or that she was forced <strong>or she comes bleeding if she was a virgin</strong> or <strong>she calls out for help so that someone comes to her </strong>and she is in that state or what resembles it of the situation in which the violation occurred." He said, <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">"If she does not produce any of those, the hadd is inflicted on her and what she claims of that is not accepted from her."</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">And the largest Fatwa Website (run by Saudi Salafi Muftis) Islam Q&amp;A writes in its fatwa (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/158282/what-is-the-difference-between-the-ruling-on-rape-and-the-ruling-on-fornication-or-adultery-can-rape-be-proven-by-modern-methods">link</a>):</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rape is essentially zina (fornication or adultery) and is proven in the same way as zina is proven, which is with <strong>four witnesses</strong>. The punishment is one hundred lashes if the man was a virgin and stoning if he was previously married ...  Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She is not to be punished if it is proven that he forced her and overpowered her. <strong>That may be known from her having screamed and shouted for help</strong>.

</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Logically, it is almost impossible for raped women to fulfill these requirements, while women are not raped in public where someone can hear their calls for help and come to see their state. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, the Largest Islamic Website is Islamweb.Net records this Fatwa (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/323002/failing-to-produce-four-witnesses-in-accusation-of-rape">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“This means that if a woman accused a pious man of forcing her into adultery and there were no witnesses to prove her claim and<strong> she did not drag him by his clothes (to prove the offense)</strong>, then she should be subjected to the<strong> hadd of slander </strong>whether or not she is well-known for chastity she should be subjected to the hadd of zina if she becomes <strong>pregnant</strong> as a result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Dear Readers, please think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">How can a poor slave girl (especially if she is 9 or 10-year-old) have power to drag his rapist to public? </li>
<li dir="ltr">And if no witness was present there, then she will get "double" punishments. One for adultery, and the 2nd one of Qadhaf, i.e. falsely accusing a free Muslim man, although she is telling the truth. </li>
<li dir="ltr">And her pregnancy becomes an evidence for her crime of doing fornication, instead of being raped. </li>
</ul>
<p>From where should we bring words to protest against these great injustices of Islam against poor slave girls? </p>
<h2><span class="hadith">No 4 witnesses are needed to punish slaves for fornication, but the ruler/owner can lash them if they become convinced based on rumours or personal doubts</span></h2>
<p><span class="hadith">In case of of 'Aisha (i.e. free women), Muhammad put the conditions like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="hadith">Four male eyewitnesses are necessary</span></li>
<li><span class="hadith">And they should have seen penis going into vagina as kohl stick goes into kohl container.</span></li>
<li><span class="hadith">And if the 4 witnesses are not complete, then rest 3 will be lashed 80 times for making a wrong allegation (although they told the truth). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hadith">But for poor slaves: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="hadith">No four male eyewitnesses.</span></li>
<li><span class="hadith">No kohl stick/container condition is necessary.</span></li>
<li><span class="hadith">No court trails are needed (where the slave could defend himself/herself) </span></li>
<li><span class="hadith">But the ruler (or the owner) could inflict punishment upon slaves, if they become satisfied on the bases of rumour or personal doutbs. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hadith">Just look at the following traditions, where Muhammad asked Ali to kill a Coptic Slave only on basis of rumours and personal doubts. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2771">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2771</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anas reported that a person (a Coptic slave whose name was "Mabur" and he was the cousin of Maria al-Qibtiyya) was charged with fornication with the slave girl of Allah's Messenger (i.e. Maria al-Qibtiyya). Thereupon Allah's Messenger said to 'Ali: Go and strike his neck. 'Ali came to him and he found him in a well making his body cool. 'Ali said to him: Come out, and as he took hold of his hand and brought him out, he found that his sexual organ had been cut. Hadrat 'Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah's Apostle and said: Allah's Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imam Hakim recorded the following tradition in his book al-Mustadrak (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211010105134/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;flag=1&amp;bk_no=74&amp;ID=6740">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="arabi" dir="RTL">«عن عايشة قالت : اهديت مارية إلى رسول اللّه ومعها ابن عم لها . قالت : فوقع عليها وقعة فاستمرت حاملا . قالت : فعز لها عند ابن عمها . قالت : فقال اهل الافك والزور : «من حاجته إلى الولد ادعى ولد غيره» وكانت امّه قليلة اللبن فابتاعت له ضائنة لبون فكان يغذى بلبنها فحسن عليه لحمه . قالت عايشة : فدخل به علىّ النبى صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم ذات يوم فقال : «كيف ترين»؟ فقلت : من غذى بلحم الضأن يحسن لحمه . قال : «ولا الشبه» قالت : فحملنى ما يحمل النساء من الغيرة أن قلت : ما أرى شبها . قالت : وبلغ رسول اللّه ما يقول الناس فقال لعلى ... ».</p>
<p class="arabi" dir="ltr">Aisha said: " Maria" was presented to the prophet of Islam (as a slave woman) and her cousin (a coptic male slave) was with her. After a while Maria became pregnant. Upon that, the people started slandering that since he [the prophet of Islam] needed child, he related the son of that slave-man to himself. Since Maria, as a mother, didn’t have enough breast milk, they fed him by sheep 's milk that’s why he (the son Ibrahim) became fat. 'Aisha said: Once the prophet brought him to me and asked what I thought about him, I replied, "everyone fed by sheep 's milk will get fat." The holy prophet said doesn’t he look like me?<strong> Aisha said, "I jealously said "No"." and then the prophet heard of the untrue accusations (rumours) of people toward Maria. Upon that the prophet sent Ali to kill her cousin</strong> (i.e. the Coptic slave) ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad did not give the Coptic slave a chance to have a fair trial in court.</li>
<li>He didn’t ask the people (who accused that Coptic slave) to bring the 4 witnesses for fornication. </li>
<li>Furthermore, all the companions who falsely accused the slave and Mariyah of fornication should have received 80 lashes, as per the Islamic punishment of "حد القذف i.e. false testimony." Their testimonies should have been invalidated in court from that point onward. This aligns with Muhammad's own actions during the incident of Ifk involving 'Aisha, where he lashed all the Sahaba who made false accusations of fornication against her.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, Imam Malik said (<a href="https://shamela.ws/book/21739/915">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>فقال مالك: يقيم السيد على عبده حد الزنى وحد القذف إذا شهد عنده الشهود</p>
<p>Malik said: The master applies, to his slave, the hadd of unlawful intercourse and of false accusation of intercourse, if the witnesses render testimony before him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the question is, if in the case of Aisha, three witnesses (even those of the rank of COMPANIONS) could give false testimony due to rumors, then why can't ordinary people give false testimony in the case of slavey due to rumors (just as they did in the case of Mariya and the coptic slave)? </p>
<p>So, why these double standards? Why not to protect slaves the similar way and put conditions of 4 male eyewitnesses and stick and kohl container for them too? </p>
<p>And Hanbali Fatwa says (<a href="https://shamela.ws/book/21642/2802">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>وإن ثبت موجب الحد بعلمه أي السيد فله إقامته</strong> لأنه قد ثبت عند ذلك كما لو أقر به ولأنه يملك تأديبه</p>
<p><strong>An owner can enforce the Hadd on his slave when it is proven based on his personal knowledge</strong> as it becomes proven to him just like it is proven through a <strong>confession</strong> and because he has the authority to discipline the slave (in other matters without requiring witnesses).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Hanbali fatwa is even worse, as an owner does not even need any external witness. If the owner becomes convinced on the basis of rumours (like Muhammad became convinced about adultery of Mariya and the coptic slave), then he can just punish innocent slaves solely on the bases of rumous and doutbs. A normal person (i.e. owner) is not so careful about testimonies and other issues as a court (a judge) is.   </p>
<p>So what, if an owner, out of anger, falsely accuses a slave, then who will protect such a slave from these brutal punishments?</p>
<p>Moreover, there were tons of psychopath owners who on slight doubts start beating slaves.</p>
<p>It is an open licence in hands of owners to beat their slaves. For example, if an owner intentionally wanted to tease and beat the slave, then he could easily do it by making a false allegation of fornication against the slave and nobody could stop him. </p>
<p>Giving this authority to the owner to punish slave without any witness, just based upon his doubts, rumours, without proper witnesses, without proper trail in the court in front of a neutral judge, is INJUSTICE against poor slaves.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Islamist Excuse</strong></span>: An Islamist wrote: "It is written in <a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1703a">Sahih Muslim 1703a</a>: "When the slave-woman of any of you commits adultery and this (offence of hers) <strong>becomes <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">clear</span></strong>, she should be flogged..." Thus, a slave girl can only be flogged for fornication if it becomes CLEAR, and not on the basis of doubts and rumour.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response</strong></span>: This word "clear" is not enough. We stay on our opinion that a proper trail in a court is needed where the testimonies can be judged properly, and the truth can be separated from rumours. Otherwise, it also became CLEAR to Muhammad on basis of doubts and rumours that Mariyah fornicated with a coptic slave and he ordered to kill him. And it also became CLEAR to many companions of Muhammad that 'Aisha indulged in adultery in the incident of IFK and they gave false testimonies against her, based upon their doubts. </p>
<h2>There is absolutely no 'physical' punishment for the owner for <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong><em>CASTRATING</em></strong></span> the slave boy and cutting his nose </h2>
<p>The following case also proves that an owner needs no witnesses or trial, but he can directly punish the slaves for adultery. </p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220424185027/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;ID=6423&amp;bk_no=6&amp;flag=1">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal, Hadith 6671</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="names"> </span><span class="hadith">أن زنباعا أبا روح وجد غلاما له مع جارية له فجدع أنفه وجبه فأتى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال من فعل هذا بك قال زنباع فدعاه النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال ما حملك على هذا فقال كان من أمره كذا وكذا فقال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم للعبد <span class="mainsubj">اذهب فأنت حر فقال يا رسول الله فمولى من أنا قال مولى الله ورسوله </span>فأوصى به رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم المسلمين قال فلما قبض رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم جاء إلى أبي بكر فقال وصية رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال نعم نجري عليك النفقة وعلى عيالك فأجراها عليه حتى قبض <span class="names">أبو بكر </span>فلما استخلف عمر جاءه فقال وصية رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال نعم أين تريد قال مصر فكتب عمر إلى صاحب مصر أن يعطيه أرضا يأكلها</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="hadith">So, there was absolutely no "physical" punishment for the owner for castrating him and cutting his nose. At the maximum, he had to set him free, which is not difficult for a rich owner. </span></p>
<p><span class="hadith">And he had to set him free, while prescribed punishment for adultery for slaves is 50 lashes. But instead of it, he castrated him. That is why he had to set him free. </span></p>
<p><span class="hadith">Moreover, modern Islamic preachers falsely claim that the ruler has to give a physical punishment (i.e. Ta'zir) if the owner kills his slave or mutilates him. But <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Muhammad's practice is clearly against this where he gave no physical punishment as Ta'zir in the case of mutilation, but the only punishment was to set the slave free as a fine. </span></span></p>
<h2>Absolutely no physical punishment (or imprisonment) for a husband if he RAPES the slave girl of his wife</h2>
<p><span class="hadith"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In the following traditions, you can see a husband is raping the slave girl of his wife, but there is absolutely not physical punishment (100 lashes or imprisonment etc.) for him. At maximum, the slave girl becomes free for being raped against her will.</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="hadith"><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3364">Sunan an-Nasa'i 3364</a>:</span></span></p>
<p>It was narrated from Salamah bin Al-Muhabbaq that a man had intercourse with a slave woman belonging to his wife, and was brought to the Messenger of Allah. He said: "<strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If he forced her (i.e. if he raped her without her consent)</span>, then she is free at his expense </strong>and he has to give her mistress a similar slave as a replacement. If she obeyed him in that, then she belongs to her mistress, and he has to give her mistress a similar slave as well."</p>
<p>Grade: Hassan (Darussalam)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar tradition has also been narrated with another chain of narration is this one <a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3363">Sunan an-Nasa'i 3363</a>. It is again graded as "Hasan" by Darussalam. </p>
<h2>Kidnapping &amp; Raping a slave woman of another person is also Halal-Allah if you got a lust for her</h2>
<p>Unbelievable!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>فَقُضِيَ بِقِيمَةِ الْجَارِيَةِ الْمَيِّتَةِ، ثُمَّ وَجَدَهَا صَاحِبُهَا، فَهْيَ لَهُ، وَيَرُدُّ الْقِيمَةَ، وَلاَ تَكُونُ الْقِيمَةُ ثَمَنًا.<br>وَقَالَ بَعْضُ النَّاسِ الْجَارِيَةُ لِلْغَاصِبِ لأَخْذِهِ الْقِيمَةَ، وَفِي هَذَا احْتِيَالٌ لِمَنِ اشْتَهَى، جَارِيَةَ رَجُلٍ لاَ يَبِيعُهَا، فَغَصَبَهَا وَاعْتَلَّ بِأَنَّهَا مَاتَتْ، حَتَّى يَأْخُذَ رَبُّهَا قِيمَتَهَا فَيَطِيبُ لِلْغَاصِبِ جَارِيَةَ غَيْرِهِ. قَالَ النَّبِيُّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ: «أَمْوَالُكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ حَرَامٌ»، «وَلِكُلِّ غَادِرٍ لِوَاءٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ».</p>
<p><strong>(9) Chapter: If somebody kidnaps a slave girl and then claims that she is dead, whereupon he is obliged by law to pay the price of the dead slave girl, but then her master finds her (alive), then she is for him, and the money is to be returned and should not be regarded as a price:</strong></p>
<p>Some people said, "The slave girl is for the kidnapper because the previous master has taken the price." In this there is a trick for whoever desires the slave girl of another man who refuses to sell her, so he kidnaps her and tells her master that she is dead and when her master takes her price, the kidnapper then has a legal right to have the slave girl of somebody else. The prophet (saw) said: "(O Muslims!) Your properties are sacred to each other, and for every treaherous betrayer, there will be a flag on the Day of Resurrection."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Islamic apologists come up with an excuse that Imam Bukhari didn't favour this trick, but he recorded it in his book while he was against the use of this trick.</p>
<p>But even if we accept their excuse, still the core question is, why those some people were able to apply this trick in an Islamic state?</p>
<p>It is for these reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>There is no Qisas (i.e. physical punishment) for killing the property (i.e. slave men and women) of another person. But you only have to pay half of the blood money. </li>
<li>And MOLESTING of slave girls in Islamic societies was very real. </li>
<li>And if someone got lust for a slave girl of another person, then he could ask for a mutual swapping of slave girls, in which both of them raped the slave girls of each other.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, if the owner of the slave girl refused for swapping, still there was a TRICK for men to fulfil their lust. In such cases, the Muslim men simply kidnapped the poor slave girls and raped them, and fulfilled their lust. </li>
<li>And they got absolutely no physical punishment for this. But they only had to pay the price of the slave girls to their owners (for damaging their property). </li>
</ul>
<p>Dear Readers!</p>
<p>It was Allah (i.e. Muhammad):</p>
<ul>
<li>Who put the first stone for such practices when he neither rebuked Sahaba for molesting slave women nor physically punished them, but only asked Free Muslim women to wear the Hijab as a sing of being free women and thus men could differentiate them from being slave women (You will read details of this important incident in the 2nd part of this article).</li>
<li>Then the 2nd stone was put when Muhammad snatched away the right of testimony from the slaves (i.e. they could not testify against their owners in any Islamic court).</li>
<li>And then the 3rd stone was put in when Muhammad declared slaves only as property, and not as humans. </li>
</ul>
<p>This evil was not only limited to the era of Imam Bukhari, but the poor slave girls suffered from this evil throughout the 1300-year-long history of Islamic Slavery. Why? While Allah/Muhammad failed to provide them with any protection against molestation. </p>

<h2 class="western">Caution: Radical Muslims pose a threat of reinstating slavery once they acquire power</h2>
<p>In the event that religious Muslims acquire power and successfully establish an Islamic Caliphate, it is crucial to understand that they will be compelled to engage in "Jihad" against all other non-Muslim states. And once this "Jihad" ensues, the revival of "slavery" will inevitably accompany it (as the captive women and children of the non-Muslims will be made slaves after the war).</p>
<p class="western">This same ruling can be found in the fatwa issued by Saudi Grand Mufti Sheikh Saleh al-Fawzan, where he openly declares that the institutions of Jihad and Slavery will automatically be reinstated upon the establishment of an Islamic Caliphate.</p>

<p>Let us read some excerpts from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jābir ibn Ḥayyān said: Byzantines have cleaner vaginas than other female slaves have. Andalusians […] are the most beautiful, sweet-smelling and receptive to learning […] Andalusians and Byzantines have the cleanest vaginas, whereas Alans (Lāniyyāt)53 and Turks have unclean vaginas and get pregnant easier.54 They have also the worst dispositions. Sindhis, Indians, and Slavs (Ṣaqāliba) and those similar to them are the most condemned. They have uglier faces, fouler odor, and are more spiteful. Besides, they are unintelligent and difficult to control, and have unclean vaginas. East Africans (Zanj55) are the most heedless and coarse. If one finds a beautiful, sound and graceful woman among them, however, no other species can match her. Women from Mecca (Makkiyāt) are the most beautiful and pleasurable of all types.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In Kufa there was an excellent brood (nitāj karīm) of male slaves from Khurasan and female slaves from India.61 The union between these two brought forth [slaves with] delicate brown complexion and beautiful stature. This went on for so long time that it became a reason behind common people’s preference for slaves from Kufa over slaves from Basra. Nevertheless, the expensive and valuable slave women, who were the most outstanding and distinguished, were from Basra, not Kufa.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The account is supported by a statement attributed to the famous author alJāḥiẓ (d. 255/868–869): Abū al-ʿAbbās, the husband of Ibrāhīm al-Naẓẓām’s sister, asked me:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">“Do you know which of all species is the most favorable for privacy with women?” I answered, “No, I do not know that.” He continued, “Know that there is abundant happiness and complete pleasure only in the brood of two dissimilar kinds. The breeding between them is the elixir that leads to purity. Specifically, that is the mating of an Indian woman with a Khurasanian man; they will give birth to pure gold.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Groups of Turks cauterize the breasts of slave-girls to prevent them from sagging, but instead they droop very much. Some of them cauterize slavegirls on the tops of their head; others cauterize them on their vulvas. Other cauterize them on their bellies and their […]91 There are imaginary stories about the Turks on this subject, but verily, they do it with their own daughters. Islamic law makes it obligatory for the buyer to be allowed to return her, even after he had sexual intercourse with her, on the condition that she was not a virgin and he did not know about the burn mark or something that looks like it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A merchant told me that he bought a Turkish slave-girl and when he got bored of her, he endeavored to return her. There was a small mark, the size of a lupine bean, on her genital area and so he could return her to her owner with a signed record (maḥḍar) from the judge (al-qāḍī).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A friend of mine told me that he had bought a beautiful Turkish slavegirl and had intercourse with her several days. One night when they woke up at sunrise after having slept together, he looked at her eyes and saw that an eyelash had grown inward and caused her eye to tear. Because of this defect, he returned the slave-girl to her owner</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">...</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The stages of inspection observed by Fabri at the slave market in Alexandria correspond roughly to those recommended by Ibn al-Akfānī. The overall process, which Fabri referred to as handling (contrectatio), began with a general survey of the slaves offered for sale. This survey, which Fabri called consideration (consideratio), was conducted at a distance and based on knowledge of physiognomy. Once the buyer had settled on a slave, he reached into the crowd and extracted the one he had selected for a second and more comprehensive appraisal (probat emendum, literally testing the thing to be bought). This stage included public viewing and touching of the slave’s naked body. If, having completed the second inspection, the buyer found the slave to be satisfactory, he met with the seller to discuss the price. This description makes clear that the slave-buying manuals’ advice to inspect the shame zones prevailed over the muḥtasib’s responsibility to prevent it. It also illustrates the dangers that threatened slaves who attempted to resist the slave-buying process: those who balked at the humiliating public inspection of their naked bodies were beaten until they complied.</p>

<h2>Prices of slaves was even lower than animals in Islamic States:</h2>

<h2 class="text-24 xs:text-20">Islamic Slavery and the Potential Spread of HIV &amp; STDs</h2>
<p>Had <strong>Islamic slavery</strong> been practiced today, it <strong>could have contributed to the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases</strong>.</p>
<p>Under <strong>Islamic law</strong>, a <strong>master was allowed to have a temporary sexual relationship</strong> with his female slave and then <strong>sell her to another master</strong>, who could also engage in sexual relations with her. This practice, if continued in modern times, would have been a <strong>major risk factor for the transmission of STDs</strong>.</p>
<p>However, <strong>thanks to the modern civilized world, Islamic slavery no longer exists</strong>.</p>
<p>This reality should serve as a wake-up call for <strong>Muslims who blame the West for the spread of HIV</strong>, yet <strong>fail to recognize the dangers inherent in their own historical practices</strong>. They condemn <strong>consenting adults</strong> for engaging in sexual relationships, yet do not acknowledge <strong>the risks of non-consensual sexual slavery sanctioned under Islamic law</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>solution to HIV is not restricting consenting adults</strong>, but rather <strong>finding a cure</strong> and <strong>implementing preventive measures</strong>.</p>
<p>A thought-provoking question for those who insist on religious sexual restrictions: <span style="color: rgb(132, 63, 161);"><em><strong>If scientists discover a cure for HIV tomorrow, would Muslims then allow consenting adults to have sex outside of marriage?</strong></em></span></p>
<h2><strong>The Double Standards in Islamic Sexual Ethics</strong></h2>
<p>A critical question for those who defend <strong>Islamic slavery and polygamy</strong>: <em><strong>Would Muslim men allow their wives today to have temporary sexual relationships with multiple partners?</strong></em></p>
<p>In Islam, <strong>men are permitted to have multiple wives</strong> and <strong>engage in sexual relations with multiple slave women</strong>—not out of necessity, but purely for <strong>pleasure</strong>. Even <strong>forced sexual relations</strong> with captive women were justified under Islamic law.</p>
<p>Yet, when the <strong>same logic is applied to women</strong>, it is immediately condemned.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Excuse of Paternity? Solved by DNA Tests:</strong></span></p>
<p>One common excuse for not allowing <strong>women multiple partners</strong> is the uncertainty of a child’s paternity. However, <strong>modern DNA testing</strong> has eliminated this issue. So, what is stopping Muslim societies today from allowing <strong>women the same sexual freedoms as men</strong>?</p>
<h3><strong>The Question of Fairness</strong></h3>
<p>... If <strong>Muslim men</strong> could have <strong>temporary</strong> relationships with <strong>multiple slave women</strong> for pleasure, and If <strong>Muslim men</strong> could <strong>force</strong> captive women into sexual relationships ... Then <strong>why can't women have temporary relationships</strong> out of their <strong>own choice and desire</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to the world of double standards!</strong></p>]]></description>

<li><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">The Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, as Islam prohibited Slave Women from taking the Hijab or even covering their naked breasts in public.</span></li>
<li><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">According to Islam, the Hijab was considered a privilege and honor exclusively for free Muslim women, while slave women were not allowed to take it.<br></span></li>
<li><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat slave women if they ever by mistake took the Hijab, and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by taking the Hijab. </span></li>
<li>Additionally, it is worth noting that Muhammad specified that the 'Awrah (nakedness) of slave women should be from navel to knee, while their chests remained uncovered. This meant that there were thousands of slave women who appeared publicly, even in the presence of Muhammad, with their breasts exposed.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Understanding these historical facts about Islam could lead Muslim women today to reconsider the necessity of wearing the Hijab.</span></p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId895120"></a>Muhammad revived the old custom of Arabia, where only high-status women were allowed to take a Hijab</h2>
<p>In pre-Islamic Arabia, there existed a cultural practice where high-status women were required to wear veils as a symbol of "honor," while prostitutes and slave women were not allowed to veil themselves.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Muhammad did not introduce Islamic hijab with the intention of promoting modesty, but rather he adopted the prevailing practices of the pre-Islamic Arabs. His aim was to distinguish free Muslim women from slave women through the implementation of hijab.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId434974"></a>In the pre-Islamic era, neither free nor slave women used to cover their breasts</h2>
<p>During the pre-Islamic era, it was customary for women, both free and slave, in various cultures around the world, including pre-Islamic Arab society, to not cover their chests.</p>

<p>What Muhammad did was to ask free Muslim women to wear Hijab, but he PROHIBITED slave women to take Hijab. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, even after the verse of the Hijab, there were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. And it stayed the same way during the 1300 years long history of Islamic Slavery. </p>

<p>According to the consensus of Muslim Quran commentators, it is widely documented that this particular verse was revealed in response to a specific incident in Medina. During that time, people would gather and sit on the sides of the streets, subjecting passing women to harassment and molestation. However, upon the revelation of this verse, the harassment of free women ceased as they started wearing hijab, which distinguished them from slave girls who did not wear hijab. Unfortunately, the molestation of slave girls persisted, as their lack of hijab served as a recognizable marker of their status as slaves.</p>

The houses of the people of Madīnah [in those days] were very small in size and at nightfall the women would go out on these streets [making their way to the fields] to relieve themselves. These evil people would tease and molest these women. While if they saw a woman who would be wearing a Jilbab (cloak/outer garment), they would say she is a free woman [and not a slave] and would abstain [from molesting her] and if they saw a woman who would not be wearing a cloak, they would molest her by saying that she is a slave woman.<br>And Mujahid said that those women would wear cloaks [in the way prescribed by the Qur'ān] so that it be known that they are free women and the mischief-mongers would not then harm or molest them.</p>

This was because free women would also go out, and they would be mistaken for slave women, and people would approach them and cause harm. The Prophet (peace be upon him) then commanded the believing women to bring their outer garments closer to them (i.e. to take the Hijab). This was to ensure that they would be recognized as free women and not be harmed."</p>

<p>هذا أمر من الله تعالى للنساء المؤمنات، وغيرة منه لأزواجهن عباده المؤمنين، وتمييز لهن عن صفة نساء الجاهلية وفعال المشركات. وكان سبب نزول هذه الآية ما ذكره مقاتل بن حيان قال بلغنا ــــ والله أعلم ــــ أن جابر بن عبد الله الأنصاري حدث أن أسماء بنت مرشدة كانت في محل لها في بني حارثة، فجعل النساء يدخلن عليها غير متأزرات، فيبدو ما في أرجلهن من الخلاخل، وتبدو صدورهن وذوائبهن، فقالت أسماء ما أقبح هذا فأنزل الله تعالى { وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَـٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَـٰرِهِنَّ }</p>
<p class="justify1">This is a command (i.e. veiling) from Allah Almighty to the believing women, as a protection for their honor and a distinction from the characteristics of women in the pre-Islamic era and the practices of pagan women. The reason behind the revelation of this verse, as mentioned by Muqatil ibn Hayyan, is that Jabir ibn Abdullah al-Ansari reported that Asma bint Marwan had a designated place in Bani Haritha, where women would visit her without wearing veils. <strong>Thus, their ankles would be exposed, along with their chests and ornaments</strong>. Upon seeing this, Asma expressed her disapproval. As a result, Allah Almighty revealed the verse: "And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision [i.e., to look down and not to expose their adornment]..." (Quran 24:31).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>Islamic preachers often assert that those individuals who engaged in harassment and molestation of women while sitting on the sides of the streets were hypocrites. However, this claim is contested by some who argue that they were not hypocrites but rather companions of Muhammad (Sahaba).</p>
<p>These individuals, who engaged in harassment and molestation, were not addressed as hypocrites in the Quran. Surprisingly, the Quran neither issued warnings nor threats against them, let alone punishments. Instead, the Quran seemingly allowed them to continue their misconduct towards slave women, while providing protection only to free women through the requirement of hijab.</p>
<p>This portrayal of events raises concerns, as it appears that the Quran provided no safeguards for the well-being of slave women, inadvertently granting these individuals a "license" to persist in their mistreatment of vulnerable slave girls.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId89821"></a>Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but it is this respect and acknowledgement of women's autonomy that truly embodies the concept of modesty</h2>
<p>Regrettably, a significant majority of ordinary Muslims today remain unaware of the historical realities and complexities surrounding hijab and its relation to Islam. This truth often comes as a surprise to them, as many Islamic preachers strive to conceal or downplay these aspects.</p>
<p>It is common for some Muslims to assert that women must wear hijab in order to prevent men from experiencing lustful desires, using the analogy that an uncovered candy attracts flies. However, it is important to recognize that this viewpoint oversimplifies the multifaceted reasons and interpretations associated with hijab within the Islamic tradition.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Please see, it was Islam which compelled thousands of slave women to move in public without a Hijab (i.e. without a wrapper). So, the question is, did Islam thus make Sahaba sexually aroused and did Sahaba rape those slave women for having naked breasts in public?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Reality: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em>Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but modesty is truly defined by the respect for women and their autonomy to make choices about their lives.</em></li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Western world, with its emphasis on upholding women's rights and their choices, is a true example of modesty and decency.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em>Hijab is not modesty, but for 14 prolonged centuries, it has been a distressing symbol of severe discrimination against impoverished slave women.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId63911"></a>Role of Umar Ibn Khattab</h2>
<p>It is known that Muhammad faced challenges when it came to rejecting Umar's desires and suggestions. Throughout Muhammad's life, there were instances where Umar made wishes or suggestions, and Muhammad later claimed to receive revelations in alignment with those desires.</p>
<p>This pattern is observed in the context of veiling women as well. It appears that Umar Ibn Khattab played a significant role in advocating for the veiling of free Muslim women, as he engaged in multiple discussions with Muhammad on the matter (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:146">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 146</a>). </p>
<p>Subsequently, following the unfortunate incident of women being molested in Medina, Muhammad claimed that the verses regarding veiling were revealed in accordance with Umar's desires.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that Umar held more extreme views on this matter. It appears that he was not content with the ruling of veiling for women and sought something beyond that. This becomes apparent through an incident involving Umar and Sawda, one of Muhammad's wives, which took place after the revelation of the hijab verses</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4795</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature <strong>after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil</strong>. She had a large frame and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, "O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us,<strong> so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out.</strong> Sauda returned while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I went out to answer the call of nature and `Umar said to me so-and-so." Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), "You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To those who advocate for Umar's stance, one might question the following:</p>
<p>Why should Sawda, or any woman for that matter, bear the burden of constantly finding new ways to conceal herself and endure the added restrictions? What harm would it have caused if people still recognized her when she ventured outside?</p>
<p>Interestingly, while Umar expressed dissatisfaction with Hafsa's veiling, he paradoxically resorted to physically disciplining slave women for attempting to wear hijab by beating them with a stick. Furthermore, he even stripped them of their jilbab (outer garment sheet), as we will explore further in this article. </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId130774"></a>An excuse by Islamic preachers: But the verse of Hijab 33:59 was revealed during the incident of 'Umar and Sawda</h3>
<p>It is impossible for Islam apologists to accept the incident that Sahaba used to molest women and thus Hijab verse was revealed only to differentiate between the Free and the Slave women. They have to deny it while it is shaking the whole religion of  Islam and every person becomes doubtful about it after knowing these facts.</p>
<p>Therefore, they try to use the following tradition and claim that the verse of the Hijab was not revealed due to the molestation of slave women by companions, but during the incident of Umar and Sawda.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:146">Sahih Bukhari, 146</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّ أَزْوَاجَ النَّبِيِّ، صلى الله عليه وسلم كُنَّ يَخْرُجْنَ بِاللَّيْلِ إِذَا تَبَرَّزْنَ إِلَى الْمَنَاصِعِ ـ وَهُوَ صَعِيدٌ أَفْيَحُ ـ فَكَانَ عُمَرُ يَقُولُ لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم احْجُبْ نِسَاءَكَ‏.‏ فَلَمْ يَكُنْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَفْعَلُ، فَخَرَجَتْ سَوْدَةُ بِنْتُ زَمْعَةَ زَوْجُ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم لَيْلَةً مِنَ اللَّيَالِي عِشَاءً، وَكَانَتِ امْرَأَةً طَوِيلَةً، فَنَادَاهَا عُمَرُ أَلاَ قَدْ عَرَفْنَاكِ يَا سَوْدَةُ‏.‏ حِرْصًا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْزِلَ الْحِجَابُ، فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ آيَةَ الْحِجَابِ‏.‏</p>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqi` at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. `Umar used to say to the Prophet (ﷺ) "Let your wives be veiled," but Allah's Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam`a the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) went out at `Isha' time and <strong>she was a tall lady</strong>. `Umar addressed her and said, "I have recognized (Arabic: عَرَفْنَاكِ) you, O Sauda." He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed.<strong> </strong>So Allah revealed the verses of "Al-Hijab".</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Our Response: </strong></p>
<p>Firstly, it is clear that any sub-narrator of this tradition made a mistake, while another tradition of <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795">Sahih Bukhari</a> (which we have already mentioned above), is also from 'Aisha, where she clearly mentioned that this incident of 'Umar and Sawda happened <strong>after</strong> the verse of Hijab had already been revealed. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4795</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature <strong>after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil</strong>. <strong>She had a large frame and everybody who knew her before could recognize her</strong>. So `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, "O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. ....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, it is also clear from both the traditions that Umar needed to recognize her through her <strong>tall height/large frame</strong>, while she was indeed wearing a Hijab (Jilbab), due to which he was unable to see her face. This proves that the verse of Hijab (33:59) had already been revealed before this incident. </p>
<p>Thirdly,  the verse itself (33:59) contradicts the notion that it was specifically revealed during the incident involving Umar and Sawda. There are two significant facts that support this claim.</p>
<p>The first fact is, by taking Jilbab (cloaks), actually the women <strong>Cannot be recognized </strong>(while their faces are covered). Therefore, nobody knows which woman is actually inside the cloak. </p>
<p>But the Quran is saying: "(the women) should take Jilbab (cloaks) so that they <strong>Can be recognised </strong>(Arabic: أدنى أن يعرفن) ...".</p>
<p>So, why then the Quran is saying the <strong>opposite</strong>, i.e. that they <strong>Can</strong> be recognized by using cloaks? The reason is, the Quran is saying it in the sense of recognizing who are slave women, and who are free Muslim women. </p>
<p>Thus, this part of the verse is itself proof that this verse was not revealed about the incident of Umar/Sawda.</p>
<p>And the second fact is, this verse is also claiming: "... and (these women are)<strong> not molested</strong>".</p>
<p>Please ask these Islamic preachers, if Umar Ibn Khattab was molesting Sawda. Surely the answer is No. It was not Umar Ibn Khattab who molested Sawda, but it were those people, who were sitting on the streets, who were molesting the women of Medina. </p>
<p>Therefore, this serves as further evidence that the hijab verse (33:59) is unrelated to the incident involving Umar and Sawda. Instead, it stands as a testimony to the existence of the twelve traditions that recount the incident of women being molested in Medina.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId616740"></a>Umar Ibn Khattab, the second Caliph, used to beat the slave women with a stick if they ever attempted to take<b> Hijab (Jilbab)</b></h2>
<p class="western">According to authentic traditions, Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat those slave girls with a stick, who ever attempted to hide their naked bodies by taking Jilbab.

<p class="western">حَدَّثَنَا <span class="Rawy_name">هُشَيْمٌ </span>، عَنْ <span class="Rawy_name">خَالِدٍ </span>، عَنْ <span class="Rawy_name">أَبِي قِلَابَةَ </span>، قَالَ : كَانَ عُمَرُ بْنُ الْخَطَّابِ لَا <span class="Gareeb"><span title="يدع : يترك">يَدْعُ </span></span>فِي خِلَافَتِهِ <span class="Gareeb"><span title="الأمة : الجارية المملوكة">أَمَةً </span></span><span class="Gareeb"><span title="التقنع : تغطية الرأس وأكثر الوجه برداء أو غيره">تَقَنَّعُ </span></span>، قَالَ : قَالَ <span class="Rawy_name">عُمَرُ </span>: إِنَّمَا الْقِنَاعُ لِلْحَرَائِرِ لَكَيْلَا لَا يُؤْذَيْنَ</p>
<p class="western">Narrated to us Hushaym, from Khalid, from Abu Qilaba, who said: "Umar ibn al-Khattab, during his caliphate, did not leave any slave girl who could cover herself. He said: 'Covering oneself is only for free (Muslim/Believing) women, so they may not be harmed (i.e. people can differentiate them with slave women and don't harm the free Muslim women).'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The traditions related to Umar Ibn Khattab further corroborate the twelve traditions that highlight the revelation of the hijab verse (33:59) as a means to distinguish between slave women and free Muslim women. These traditions collectively provide supporting evidence for this understanding of the verse's purpose.</span></p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId741600"></a>Please also note the difference between "Jilbab" and "Khimar":</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="western"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilb%C4%81b">A Jilbab</a> (or  <a href="https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D9%85%D9%82%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A9/">Muqna</a>) was a big outer garment/sheet that is put on the head, draped around the body and that totally covers the breasts and the body of the woman. In the verse of Hijab (Quran 33:59), the writer of the Quran ordered free Muslim women to use this same Jilbab, to cover their breasts and bodies. While slave women were not allowed to use Jilbab to cover their breasts and the body. In traditions, Umar Ibn Khattab removed this same Jilbab from the heads of slave women, which again exposed their naked breasts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western">And “Khimar (Arabic:  خمار)” is a small headscarf, which covers only the head and comes up to the shoulders. We see Arab men using this “Khimar” (Arabic headscarf) today. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:275">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ <strong>وَالْخِمَارِ</strong></p>
<p> Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped over the socks and <strong>Khimar</strong> (Arabic Head Scarf)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Slave women were allowed to cover their head and hair by wearing <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21134/is-niqab-compulsory#:%7E:text=Khimar%20comes%20from%20the%20word,something%20else%20is%20called%20Khimar.">Khimaar خمأر</a>. Covering the head was a per-Islamic tradition due to the heat in Arab area.</p>
<p>And 'Abdul Razzaq recorded in this book al-Musanif (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115185806/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=73&amp;ID=520&amp;idfrom=4807&amp;idto=4820&amp;bookid=73&amp;startno=6">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>عبد الرزاق عن بن جريج قال بلغني عن أشياخ من أهل المدينة أن الخمر على الإماء إذا حضن وليس عليهن الجلابيب</p>
<p>Abd al-Razzaq narrated from Ibn Jarir who said: "I heard from the elders of Medina that when a slave girt started to menstruate, she would cover her head with Khimar, but not wear a Jilbab."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, Khimar was not the main distinguishing factor between free women and slave women, as both of them were covering their heads with Khimar. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The main distinguishing factor between them was Jilbab. And in the traditions above, Umar Ibn Khattab removed this Jilbab of slave women, which again exposed their naked breasts.</p>

<p>The 1400 years of history of Islam also consists of this shameful act against humanity, where Muslims forced those women/girls to become half naked by exposing their breasts, and then forced them to stand in front of thousands of men in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, who not only looked at them with lust but they were also allowed to touch their private parts (as if they were sheep and goats).</p>

<p align="left">Even when Islam was not selling the slave women in the Bazaars, still it forced them to move outside in front of thousands of men, with naked breasts, while Islam declared the intimate parts of slave women (‘Awrah) of slave women were from the navel to the knee only.</p>
<p align="left">It is perhaps the “Biggest Contradiction” in Islam. On one side, Islam asked free Muslim women to take a full-body Hijab, but on the other side, Islam snatched away the right of Hijab from slave women and even forced them to move outside with naked breasts.</p>

Rather, it is allowed in order to assess her before bargaining (<a href="http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1893_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_287#top">link</a>).</p>

It is mentioned it is authentic report. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in his Sunan (5/329) through the narration of Ubaidullah ibn Umar from Nafi' from Ibn Umar: "Whenever he would buy a slave girl, he would uncover her leg and place his hand between her breasts and on her private area." At the end of the narration, there is an addition: "It is as if he would place his hand on her from behind the clothing." It is possible that this addition is from Al-Bayhaqi or from some of its narrators. And the chain of narration is authentic.</p>

<p class="western">On one side, Muhammad made a woman's life difficult in the name of “Hijab and modesty”,  practically imprisoning her in her home and cutting her off from the outside world. She was prohibited from interacting with other men, and even if she needed to speak, she was required to do so in a harsh voice.</p>

<p>Can you see these two extreme contradictions?</p>
<p>On one hand, free women are confined and covered from head to toe in Jilbab, and sometimes even further restricted within the walls of their homes. They are forced to live unnatural lives, where any interaction with men is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, slave women are left exposed, with their breasts uncovered. They are treated as commodities, allowing customers to touch their private parts like animals.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId681614"></a>'Aisha bathed in front of two Mahram MEN, while the nakedness of a woman in front of Mahram man is also just like the nakedness of a slave woman</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the revelation of the verse of Hijab, neither free Muslim women nor slave women covered their naked breasts in public, as it was a custom of the Arabs of that era.</li>
<li>After the revelation of the verse of Hijab, free Muslim women began covering their naked breasts and bodies with Jilbab <strong>ONLY</strong> in <strong>Public</strong>.</li>
<li>But the instruction to wear Jilbab did not apply indoors in front of Mahram men. Therefore, free Muslim women did not covered their naked breasts with Jilbab inside their homes in front of their Mahram male relatives. According to Islamic law, a free Muslim woman's 'Awrah (private parts) in front of Mahram men extended only from her navel to her knees.</li>
</ul>

<p>Qadi Ayad says: <em><strong>It is apparent that they could see her actions from her head and the top half of her body, because they were allowed to do</strong></em> as she was a milk-aunt to Abu Salamah and his brother from her sister Umm Kulthum.

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId666035"></a>Excuses by Islamic apologists:</h2>
<p>Here are a few excuses, which are presented by Islamic apologists today:</p>
<h3>Islamists' Demand: Show us direct Hadith from the Prophet in Bukahri or Muslim that slave women were prophibited to wear the Hijab</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response:</strong></span></p>
<p>If Muslims insist on finding a direct hadith from Muhammad in Bukhari or Muslim regarding this matter, such a demand is not appropriate because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We could then ask Muslims to present direct hadiths from Bukhari and Muslim where Muhammad explicitly stated the opposite—namely, that it is OBLIGATORY for slave women to wear the Hijab.</li>
<li>The entire 1300-year history of Islamic Slavery, including all Fiqh rulings, historical records, and the unanimous practices of the Ummah, provides ample evidence that slave women were not permitted to wear the Hijab. This raises a crucial question: If this practice was indeed against Islamic Sharia, and Allah already knew that the entire Ummah would be misguided on this issue, why was there <strong>not a single clear verse</strong> revealed in the Quran mandating that slave women must wear the Hijab?</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId464960"></a>The Dishonest Translation of verse 24:31 by modern Islamic apologists to prove that Khimar was also used to cover the naked breasts of slave women</h3>
<p>Please be aware of dishonesty of some of the modern Islamic apologists. Their deception is where they have started claiming that Khimar was not a head covering, but Allah ordered to cover the breasts too with Khimar. </p>

<p>وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَٰرِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ <strong>بِخُمُرِهِنَّ</strong> عَلَىٰ<strong> جُيُوبِهِنَّ</strong> ۖ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ ...</p>
<p>[Dr. Mustafa Khattab]  And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their adornments except what normally appears. Let them draw their <strong>veils</strong> (i.e. Khimar خمار)  over their <strong>chests</strong> (Arabic:جُيُوبِهِنَّ), and not reveal their ˹hidden˺ adornments except to their husbands, their fathers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, they have started translating Khimar as "veils" (instead of a "Head Covering"), and the word جُيُوبِ as chests (instead of neckline/bosom). By doing so, they want to make this argument that although Umar took away the Jilbab from slave women, but it didn't expose their naked breasts, while slave women were covering their breasts with Khimar. </p>
<p>However, this modern translation is wrong, and here is proof:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to note that in the verse, the Arabic word جُيُوبِ (singular <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart">جَيْب</a>) is used. When modern Muslim translators translate it as '<strong>chest</strong>', then it is wrong. The correct translation of جَيْب (singular <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart">جَيْب</a>) is '<strong>neckline/bosom</strong>', referring to the area where ornaments like necklaces are worn. It does not refer to covering the breasts of women, but rather the upper part of the chest and neck. You can find the exact translation of this word on wiktionary (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart">link</a>). 'Chest' is not the appropriate translation, as the Arabic word for chest is "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1">Sadar (صدر)</a>". Therefore, this verse only instructed women to conceal their ornaments such as earrings and necklaces by using their headscarves.</li>
<li>However, many Muslim translators (<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/24/31/default.htm">link</a>) didn't show this dishonesty, and they indeed translated these words (i.e. Khimar and Jiyub) correctly as a "head covering" and "Bosoms/necklines". </li>
</ul>
<p>It is written in Tafsir Madarak al-Tanzil, under verse 24:31 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=17&amp;tSoraNo=24&amp;tAyahNo=31&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=1&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>كانت جيوبهن واسعة تبدو منها صدورهن وما حواليها وكن يسدلن الخمر من ورائهن فتبقى مكشوفة فأمرن بأن يسدلنها من أقدامهن حتى تغطيها<br>(During the (pre-Islamic) time of ignorance, the custom among the Arab women was) their bosoms were naked due to which their chest and area around it was exposed. And women used to hang their head scarfs (Khimar) on the backside, due to which bosoms (necklines) were exposed. They were ordered (in this verse) to hang their head scarfs on the front side, so that the bosoms are covered. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:275">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ <strong>وَالْخِمَارِ</strong></p>
<p> Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped over the socks and <strong>Khimar</strong> (Arabic Head Scarf)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is written in Tafsir-e-Mazhari, under the commentary of this verse 24:31 (<a href="http://equranlibrary.com/tafseer/mazhari/24/31">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the Scholars are 'Unanimous اجماع' that this verse is only for the free (Muslim) women ... Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad deemed the nakedness of a slave woman from navel till knees. While Imam Abu Hanifa considered her stomach and back to be a part of her nakedness too. </p>

<h3><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId747240"></a>Islamic Preachers: Hijab is necessary for a woman so that her husband does not feel jealous and uncomfortable due to his Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة)</h3>
<p>Islamic preachers claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If woman wears revealing clothing which shows her beauty in front of other males; her husband would feel extremely jealous and feel uncomfortable due to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghayrah">Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة)</a>. But with hijab, this is evaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May we then ask the Islamic preachers what about the Ghayrah of poor slave women? Why did Muhammad prohibit Hijab for slave women? Why did Muhammad then keep the breasts of slave women naked? There were thousands of slave women in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. Why did Umar Ibn Khattab use to beat slave women who took Hijab, even by mistake?</p>
<p>And if a Muslim master got lust for a slave woman of another man, then they could simply swap their slave women with each other, and rape them. Tafsir-e-Mazhari is a commentary of the Quran, which is taught in every Hanafi school. It is written under the commentary of verse 33:52 (<a href="https://sachaai.com/images/swap_slave_girls_mazhari.jpg">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Zayd said about this verse {وَلَآ أَن تَبَدَّلَ بِهِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجٍ nor to exchange your present wives for other women (<a href="https://quranx.com/33.52">Verse 33:52</a>)} that people used to swap their wives during the era of ignorance ... upon that Allah revealed this verse. <strong>But the slave women are not included in it, and you can swap them and there is no problem in it</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, where has that jealousy and Ghayrah gone now? </p>
<p>Even worse, in the case of the wife of the male slave, even this swap is not needed. If the master gets lust for the wife of his male slave, then he can simply take her away from him and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, he can once again return her over to his slave. </p>
<blockquote><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5105/" rel="mw:ExtLink" data-ve-attributes="{&quot;rel&quot;:&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot;}">Sahih Bukhari, 5105:</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. There is no harm in a man (i.e the owner) taking his female slave (for himself) from his male slave.</blockquote>
<p>So, what is about the Ghairah of a poor male slave, whose wife is being raped by his owner? Unbelievable!</p>
<p>And why does Islam talk only about the Ghairah of men? <strong>Why does it not care even the slightest about the Ghayrah of poor slave women?</strong> Why are they made to be raped by multiple Muslim men in a TEMPORARY sexual relationship without their consent? </p>
<p>Islam turns even small pre-pubescent captive girls of war into slaves, although they had no role in the wars, and they were totally innocent. And then Islam took away all their Ghayrah, and they were also raped by multiple Muslim men in temporary sexual relationships. </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId93010"></a>'Lowering the gazes' is only an Unnatural restriction, which results only in 'sexual frustration':</h3>
<p>Islamic preachers claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Allah ordered the lowering of gazes in the Quran, and it is also modesty. Men normally lustfully gaze at, look at women(even if inadvertently, without being aware of it) but hijab prevents women getting unsolicited, unwanted looks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We absolutely don't agree with Muslim's claim of this so-called 'modesty' in the name of 'lowering the gazes', while:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Lowering of the gazes' is also not modesty, but an unnatural restriction upon the women and the men. </li>
<li>And Muslim men were ordered to lower their gazes only in the presence of free Muslim women. As far as slave women are concerned, then Muslim men are not needed to lower their gazes and they are allowed to look at them. It is written in Hanafi Fiqh book Fatawa Alamgiri (<a href="https://sachaai.com/images/Alamgiri_Awrah_slave_woman.jpg">link</a>):<em> "It is allowed to see the whole body of a slave woman of another person, except between her navel and the knees ... And all that is allowed to be seen, it is also allowed to be touched."</em> And it is written in the Book "Al-Sharh al-Saghir" of Maliki Fiqh (<a href="http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html">link</a>): فيرى الرجل من المرأة - إذا كانت أمة - أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة <strong>Translation:</strong> A man can see more of the body of a slave woman as compared to what she can see of a man. She is allowed only to see his hands and feet, while a man is allowed to see her whole body naked except for the part between her navel and knees.</li>
<li>And prohibiting women to talk with men, or both of them to interact with each other is also not modesty, but again an unnatural restriction. </li>
<li>These unnatural restrictions result only in the form of an extremely 'Frustrated' society. Please read our article: <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/women-and-hijab/1"> The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration.</a></li>
<li>And in order to see the real destruction of these unnatural restrictions, please see the <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/100">Incident of Ifk</a>, where people put the howdah of 'Aisha on the camel, while they thought 'Aisha was present there. But 'Aisha was not present there. This happened while Islam prohibits interaction between men and women, and thus people didn't even say "hello" to 'Aisha. This led to such devastating results where 2 tribes of Muslims were about to kill each other, and Muhammad was close to divorcing 'Aisha, and this whole drama lasted for a complete month. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, let us make it clear that: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>It is the RESPECT of women and their choices, which is counted as modesty. </em></strong></li>
<li>And the Western world is modest. It provided women with protection by demanding that men respect women and their choices. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId223301"></a>Islamic Apologists: Slave women were allowed to expose their chest/breasts, but it was not necessary</h3>
<p>Islamic apologists also come up with this excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The verses, narrations, and exegeses only state that the slave women were not allowed to cover their hair, which was the main distinguishing factor between free women and slave women. They were allowed to expose their chest/breasts, but it was not necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>This is not true.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is no Quranic verse or Hadith present which claims that it was the own personal choice of slave women either to expose their chests or to cover them. Islamic apologists must come up with proof for this claim. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Secondly, according to verse <a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=33&amp;vid=59">33:59</a> and Ahadith it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilb%C4%81b">Jilbab جلبأب</a>, which was the main distinguishing factor between free and slave women. Slave women were not allowed to wear the Jilbab. Jilbab was a big sheet of garment, which was put on the head, and it covered the whole body along with breasts.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thirdly, slave women were indeed allowed to cover their head and hair by wearing <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21134/is-niqab-compulsory#:%7E:text=Khimar%20comes%20from%20the%20word,something%20else%20is%20called%20Khimar.">Khimaar خمأر</a> , which is a small "<strong>head scarf</strong>", which Arab men do wear still today. Covering the head was a per-Islamic tradition due to the heat in Arab area. Thus, Khimar was not the main distinguishing factor between free women and slave women. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Fourthly, the 'Awrah (nakedness) of slave woman is from the navel to the knee. Therefore, the main question is, why didn't Allah (i.e. Muhammad) <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">ORDER</strong> that it is <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">OBLIGATORY</strong> upon slave women to cover their breasts and body? What would have happened if slave women had to cover their breasts under these obligatory orders? Unfortunately, Islamic apologists don't answer this main and direct question. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Fifthly, yes some slave women tried to cover their breasts by wearing putting the Jilbab on their heads (covering their breasts too), but Umar Ibn Khattab started beating them and told them not to try to resemble free Muslim women. He compelled those slave women to remove the Jilbab from their heads, again exposing their breasts. Please read all the traditions about Umar Ibn Khattab above in the article where he is removing this Jilbab. Thus, it was not an option that slave women had either to expose or to cover their breasts. </p>
<p>Here are few Ahadith about Khimar and how slave women used to wear it:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:275">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ <strong>وَالْخِمَارِ</strong> <br> Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped over the socks and Khimar (Arabic Scarf)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that Khimar was only a head covering. </p>
<p>And 'Abdul Razzaq recorded in this book al-Musanif (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115185806/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=73&amp;ID=520&amp;idfrom=4807&amp;idto=4820&amp;bookid=73&amp;startno=6">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>عبد الرزاق عن بن جريج قال بلغني عن أشياخ من أهل المدينة أن الخمر على الإماء إذا حضن وليس عليهن الجلابيب</p>
<p>Abd al-Razzaq narrated from Ibn Jarir who said: "I heard from the elders of Medina that when a slave girt started to menstruate, she would cover her head with Khimar, but not wear a Jilbab."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is written in Tafsir-e-Mazhari, under the commentary of this verse 24:31 (<a href="http://equranlibrary.com/tafseer/mazhari/24/31">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the Scholars are 'Unanimous اجماع' that this verse is only for the free (Muslim) women ... Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad deemed the nakedness of a slave woman from navel till knees. While Imam Abu Hanifa considered her stomach and back to be a part of her nakedness too. </p>

</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">All of them came about 450 years after Muhammad. Ibn Hazm (died 456 Hijri) was the first one who went against the IJMA of all Salaf Muslims of the first 450 years. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the second problem is that all of them belonged to the <strong>Zahiri Madhab.</strong> </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And all other Ulama (of 4 Sunni Fiqh) during their time and after them and until now deny them on the issue of the nakedness of a slave woman. </p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just look at <a class="mw-redirect" title="Tabi‘un" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi%E2%80%98un">Tābi‘ūn</a> (i.e. the 2nd generation of Muslims after Sahaba), and Tabi' al-Tabi'in (i.e. 3rd generation of Muslims), like Abu Malik, Abu Saleh, Muawiyyah, Hassan, Siddi and Mujahid (see the discussion about verse 33:59 above in our article).</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just look at the fatwas of all 4 Sunni Imams of Fiqh.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just look at the practice of the whole Muslim community. Imam Malik personally disliked it but he was a witness himself that the whole Muslim community was practising it where the breasts of slave women were naked. Thus, Imam Malik was unable to convince the Caliph to stop this practice, as Malik was unable to present any proof from Quran and Sunnah against it.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even after Ibn Hazm and Ibn Taymiyyah (and all others who are mentioned in this article), the later coming Muslim Scholars like Ibn Kathir and Fiqh Scholars didn't give any importance to these lame excuses of Ibn Taymiyyah and to these other few Zahiri madhab followers and kept this view that breasts of slave women were naked in the Islamic society.</li>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In the whole article, only Abu Hayan, Ibn al-Qattan brought a single proof i.e. verse 33:59 and claimed that this verse prohibits the naked breasts of slave women. According to this article:</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This article claims that Albani wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is strange that some exegetes are fooled by these weak narrations, such that they adhere to the view restricting His saying ‘<strong>the believing women</strong>’ as free women to the exclusion of maidservants,</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As compared to Albani, there are Tabaeen (like Abu Malik, Abu Saleh, Muawiyyah, Hassan, Siddi and Mujahid) who all pointed out that in this verse the believers who are addressed are the free Muslim women, and this verse was itself revealed to make a distinction between the free and the slave woman.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">After Tabaeen, all the Fiqh Imams, and all the Quran Mufassirin of the first 450 years and then later till today (except for a few Zahiris) pointed out that this verse is indeed making a distinction and, in this verse, the "believing women" only mean the free women as only they had to take the jilbab. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, the conjecture of Albani has no value in front of these Tabaeen, and then Ijma of the whole Ummah for the first 500 years, and late too except for a few Zahiri Scholars.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, there are not "some exegetes", but ALL of them (except for a few Zahiris) accepted these traditions and the collective practice of Muslim Society proves that 'Awrah of a slave woman is only from navel to knee. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islamic apologists also claim that Albani declared all these Traditions as weak:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is strange that some exegetes are fooled by these weak narrations</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">While the reality is totally opposite to what Albani claims, as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> Neither are they "some exegetes", but almost ALL of them accepted these traditions.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And All the Fiqh Imams accepted these traditions.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And in fact, it is no more a question of traditions, because it was the <strong>continuous practice</strong> of the whole Muslim society and in the first 450 years no one challenged it. The first one was Ibn Hazm who claimed otherwise, but he was unable to bring a single verse from Quran or single Hadith for his claim. </li>

Al-Qadhi said in "al-Jami'" that everything besides that (i.e. what is mentioned above) is 'awrah, because it is usually not exposed, similar to what is beneath the navel.

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This article tried to cast doubts about the wrongdoing of Umar Ibn Khattab by writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anas reported:</p>
<p>قَالَ رَأَى عُمَرُ أَمَةً لَنَا مُتَقَنِّعَةً فَضَرَبَهَا وَقَالَ لَا تَشَبَّهِي بِالْحَرَائِرِ</p>
<p>Umar saw one of our maidservants wearing a veil and he flogged her. Umar said: Do not resemble free women.</p>
<p>(Source: Muṣannaf Ibn Abī Shaybah 6/236)</p>
<p>The authenticity of this report, through various chains of authority, is questionable. Even if it is authentic, it does not prove anything about the limits of a maidservant’s nakedness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already provided multiple traditions above, which have been authenticated by Muslims Scholars themselves, and all of them prove that indeed Umar Ibn Khattab beat the slave woman for taking the Jilbab and hiding her body. And indeed it proves that the breasts of slave women became naked after the removal of Jilbab/Muqna, while it was the only garment they used to hide their naked bodies and breasts. </p>
<p>Islamic apologists claim that the tradition says the Umar uncovered the head/hairs of the slave girl and not her breast. </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Covering the head/hair was not a part of the 'Awrah (nakedness) of the slave women. Their 'Awrah was only from the navel till the knees.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The slave girls used the Jilbab for covering the whole body and it was Jilbab that was the sign of distinction between the free woman and the slave woman.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, when Umar took away the Jilbab, then not only breasts became naked, but also the head/hairs, but it was not the issue.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId920556"></a>8th Issue: Excuse that slave women made their breasts naked only while they were physically working</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The article claims:</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> It seems to have been a concession granted as a way of lightening their workload ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is a lame excuse. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Covering the naked breasts is not a problem in doing physical work.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And when Umar Ibn Khattab beat the slave woman for wearing Jilbab, then she was not working at that time, but she was only walking in public with a Hijab. Nevertheless, Umar Ibn Khattab still took away her Hijab and told her not to resemble the free Muslim women by taking a Hijab. </p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islam not only allowed the customers to watch the naked breast and bodies of the slave women but they were also allowed to touch their bodies, including the private parts like breasts, buttocks and thighs (whole body, except for vagina). For example, Imam Bayhiqi wrote in his book Sunan al-Kubra (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150909140424/http://library.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?bk_no=673&amp;pid=332183&amp;hid=9985">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>عن نافع ، عن ابن عمر ” أنه كان إذا اشترى <strong>جارية</strong> كشف عن ساقها ووضع يده بين ثدييها و على عجزها<br>Translation:<br>According to Nafi', from Ibn 'Umar, it is narrated that when he would purchase a female slave, he would uncover her leg and place his hand between her breasts and on her private part.</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But <a href="https://debunkingantiislamists.quora.com/Naked-Slave-Girls-in-Islam?comment_id=6388996&amp;comment_type=3">this Website</a> of Islamic apologists denied it, and presented the following excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The word used in this Hadith is “<strong>jariya جارية</strong>” , and Jariya refers to a very young girl that has the ability to run around, not even a girl who attained puberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is a strange excuse. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Firstly, even if Ibn Umar and Muslim customers were placing their hands on the naked breasts and buttocks of a young girl, still that is disgusting enough to leave the whole religion of Islam. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Secondly, it is a false excuse, and Allah/Muhammad allowed to dishonour even the fully grown-up slave girls and slave women by touching their naked bodies.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The word "Jariya" does not mean small girl (as Islamic apologists claimed), but it means fully grown-up slave girl. We can see it in hundreds of other Ahadith. For example, let us see this word in a Hadith that is present in Sahih Muslim, Book of Marriage (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1439a">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">عَنْ جَابِرٍ، أَنَّ رَجُلاً، أَتَى رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَقَالَ إِنَّ لِي <strong>جَارِيَةً</strong> هِيَ خَادِمُنَا وَسَانِيَتُنَا وَأَنَا أَطُوفُ عَلَيْهَا وَأَنَا أَكْرَهُ أَنْ تَحْمِلَ ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ‏"‏ اعْزِلْ عَنْهَا إِنْ شِئْتَ فَإِنَّهُ سَيَأْتِيهَا مَا قُدِّرَ لَهَا ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فَلَبِثَ الرَّجُلُ ثُمَّ أَتَاهُ فَقَالَ إِنَّ الْجَارِيَةَ قَدْ حَبِلَتْ ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ‏"‏ قَدْ أَخْبَرْتُكَ أَنَّهُ سَيَأْتِيهَا مَا قُدِّرَ لَهَا ‏"‏ ‏.‏</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Jabir  reported that a man came to Allah's Messenger  and said: I have a slave-girl (<strong>جَارِيَةً</strong>) who is our servant and she carries water for us <strong>and I have intercourse with her</strong>, but I do not want her to conceive. He said: Practise 'azl, if you so like, but what is decreed for her will come to her. The person stayed back (for some time) and then came and said: <strong>The girl has become pregnant,</strong> whereupon he said: I told you what was decreed for her would come to her.</p>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId213736"></a>10th Issue: Imam Malik's statement</h3>
<p>Islamic apologists also presented this argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Malik was asked: Do you dislike a servant-girl to go out bare-chested? Malik said: Yes, and I would punish her for that. (Source: Mawāhib al-Jalīl 1/501)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already made it clear about Imam Malik that it was his "Personal Liking/Disliking", but it has nothing to do with Quran/Hadith and Islamic Sharia.</p>
<p>You could see that despite this personal disliking, Malik is unable to present a single verse from Quran or to bring a single Hadith which claims otherwise.</p>
<p>That is why when Malik wrote a letter to Sultan and demanded to ban slave women with naked breasts in the public, the Sultan denied it while Malik failed to provide any proof from Quran/Sunnah. </p>
<p>The Maliki Scholar Imam Ibn Abi Zayd (died 386 Hijri) wrote in his book "al-Jameh" (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170106054129/http://www.ummah.com/forum/showthread.php?408719-A-female-slaves-awrah-questions">link</a>), and also see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303222328/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/367498/slave-women-did-not-walk-bare-breasted-during-lifetime-of-prophet-sallallaahu-alayhi-wa-sallam">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><strong>"He (i.e. al-Imam Malik ibn Anas) strongly disapproved of the behavior of the slave women of al-Medinah in going out uncovered above the lower garment (i.e with naked breasts). He said: "I have spoken to the Sultan about it, but I have not received a reply."</strong></blockquote>
<p>In fact, these statements of Imam Malik are themselves proof of the continuous practice of the whole Muslim society where slave women were moving in public with naked breasts. </p>
<p>In fact, when it came to giving Fatwa about Islamic Sharia, then Imam Malik himself accepted that breasts are not included in the 'Awrah of slave women. </p>
<p>And it is written in the Book "Al-Sharh al-Saghir" of Maliki Fiqh (<a href="http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>فيرى الرجل من المرأة - إذا كانت أمة - أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة</blockquote>
<blockquote>A man can see more of the body of a slave woman as compared to what she can see of a man. She is allowed only to see his hands and feet, while a man is allowed to see her whole body naked except for the part between her navel and knees.</blockquote>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId910404"></a>Islamic apologists: Taba'in became corrupt and they initiated the Bidah (innovation) of naked breasts of slave women</h3>
<p>The incident of Imam Malik itself became a strong witness that slave women were present in public with naked breasts.</p>
<p>Thus Islamic apologists made up this excuse (on their own) that the breasts of slave women were not naked during the time of Muhammad and Sahaba, but then Tabi'in (i.e. the Muslim generation which followed Sahaba) became corrupt and they went against Islamic Sharia, and they initiated the Bidah (innovation) of keeping slave-women naked in the public. See this fatwa at <a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/367498/slave-women-did-not-walk-bare-breasted-during-lifetime-of-prophet-sallallaahu-alayhi-wa-sallam"> Islamweb.Net</a>. </p>
<p>This is a ridiculous claim and a conjecture without any proof. </p>
<p>There is an Ijma of ALL the Salaf Muslims of the first 450 years that it was not a Bidah, but indeed Islamic Sharia. </p>
<p>How can these modern Muslim apologists blame ALL of their Salaf Muslims of the first 450 years of UNANIMOUSLY indulging in misguidance, and introducing an innovation of keeping the breasts of slave women naked in public? </p>

<p>Unbelievable, but it is true that Islamic apologists do come up with this argument that it is the right of customers to check the product before buying it, and thus there is no harm in touching the naked body of slave-girl, while she is standing there for sale.</p>
<p>The problem is that the "base" of Islam is wrong, as it turns the captive women and small children into slaves. </p>
<p>These poor women and children had no role in the wars, and they were innocent, but still, Muhammad turned them into slaves for the whole of their lives, and then also made their rape Halal, and then their sale Halal too, and then making them naked too, and then touching their private parts too (except for vagina). Not only those women and small girls/boys were made slaves for their entire life, but their later coming generations were also born automatically as slaves, due to the evil of "Slavery by Birth" in Islam. </p>
<p>Nothing good could come out if your base is itself evil and corrupt. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId333028"></a>Is Allah really All-Knowing? Why then He forgot to mention in the Quran that slave women have to cover their breasts?</h2>
<p>While Allah was UNABLE to explicitly state in the Quran that slave women should cover their breasts, resulting in ALL Muslims of the first 4 centuries being misguided and unanimously agreeing (IJMA) that slave girls could move in public with naked breasts.</p>
<p>As a result, the unfortunate slave women had to endure this neglect from the so-called all-knowing and all-wise Allah for 13 centuries of Islamic Slavery's history until Kafir Western intervention forcefully abolished slavery in Islamic countries.</p>
<p>Allah filled the Quran, a huge book, with boasts about his powers and praises, yet failed to mention a single verse about the naked breasts of slave women.</p>
<p>Who should be held responsible for the suffering endured by millions of slave women?</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId514607"></a><a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/article/183231/the-concept-of-tawatur">Tawattur</a> (the widespread practice) in actions of Sahaba and Tabaeen in keeping thousands of slave women with naked breasts in public</h2>
<p>This action, known as Tawattur, was consistently observed by the Muslim Ummah.</p>
<p>Imam Malik, being a Tabi'i himself in Medina, witnessed the actions of the Tabi'in in Medina, where they kept the breasts of thousands of slave women naked.</p>
<p>Not only Imam Malik, but also other jurists before him witnessed this widespread practice among the Sahaba and Tabi'in.</p>
<p>For instance, Abu Hanifa, who was also a Tabi'i, observed the Tawattur among the Sahaba, as <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">they kept thousands of slave women with naked breasts in public.</strong></p>
<p>It is inconceivable that Malik and Abu Hanifa would have witnessed this Tawattur in the actions of the Sahaba and Tabi'in, and still had gone opposite to it.</p>

<p>The most potent tools in arsenal of Islamic apologists are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crafting highly convincing yet flawed excuses</li>
<li>Employing deception</li>
<li>Spreading propaganda</li>
</ul>
<p>Normal people stand little chance against these tactics. They are likely to be misled, with limited ability to uncover the truth.</p>
<p>The only defense against such deceptions is <strong>knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p>Indeed, <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>knowledge is power</strong></span>— only it equips you to resist and overcome these manipulative strategies. </p>
<p>Our goal is to share knowledge, ensuring that no one can mislead you through these deceptions, enabling you to uncover the truth.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId636123"></a>Islamic Claim: It was only the achievement of Islam that it encouraged to set the slaves free</h2>
<p>Islam apologists claim that Islam alone encouraged the act of freeing slaves, but this assertion is completely incorrect. The truth is that the practice of freeing slaves existed in societies that predated Islam by thousands of years.</p>
<p>Even during the era of Muhammad, the polytheistic Kafir society also followed the tradition of liberating slaves as a virtuous act.</p>
<p class="western">For example, Hakim Ibn Hazaam set 100 slaves free during the pre-Islamic time as a polytheist, in order to make his pagan gods happy.</p>
<p class="western">Sahih Bukhari, Kitaab-ul-Atq (<a href="http://www.hadithurdu.com/01/1-1-2434/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">أَنَّ حَکِيمَ بْنَ حِزَامٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ أَعْتَقَ فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ مِائَةَ رَقَبَةٍ</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">Hakim bin Hizam manumitted one-hundred slaves in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance</blockquote>
<p>Hakim bin Hazaam manumitted those 100 slaves solely to appease his idol gods during the time of ignorance. However, this act does not nullify the other cruelties inflicted upon slaves by the pagan Arab culture.</p>
<p>Even in ancient Greece, a thousand years prior to Islam, they would liberate slaves as a humanitarian gesture. If a slave possessed money, they not only bought their own freedom but also the freedom of their fellow slaves. In the Roman Empire, it was common for owners to include in their wills that all their slaves would be emancipated upon their death. This practice became so widespread that King Augustus had to impose restrictions, allowing the manumission of a maximum of a hundred slaves, and fewer in smaller households. Eventually, this practice became so prevalent that Augustus decreed that no Roman slave could be freed before reaching the age of 30 <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Islam was unable to show the manumission of slaves at this huge level even after 1000 years.</span></p>
<p class="western">Now compare it to Muhammad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai/21">Sunan al-Nasa'i, 1960</a>:</p>
<p>It was narrated from 'Imrân bin Husain that a man freed six slaves of his when he was dying, and he did not have any wealth apart from them. News of that reached the Prophet and he was angry about that. He said: "I was thinking of not offering the funeral prayer for him. He cast lots among them, then freed two and left four as slaves.</p>
<p><strong>Classed sahih by al-Albani</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the pursuit of humanity, common Roman citizens liberated all their slaves. However, Muhammad took on a similar role as Augustus by imposing limitations on the number of slaves that could be emancipated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, let us not forget the Buddhists who were pioneers in completely abolishing the slave trade and slave markets. They later replaced the system of slavery with serfdom, granting freedom to all slaves. Islam lagged far behind the Buddhists in their treatment of slaves, yet Islamic preachers audaciously claim that only Islam encouraged the manumission of slaves.</p>
<p>Similar examples can be found in the Persian King "Cyrus the Great" and the Persian Sassanid Empire, where efforts were made to emancipate slaves.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId606358"></a>Islamic Claim: The owner has to set the slave free if he slaps him</h2>
<p>The most commonly cited defense of Islamic slavery by Muslim Preachers is the assertion that an owner must free his slave if he slaps them.</p>
<p>Regrettably, this claim is once again deceptive and does not accurately portray the full truth. In reality, it was merely a recommendation to liberate a slave for slapping, but the law did not impose any punishment on an owner, even if they were to kill their slave.</p>
<p class="western">Islamic apologists present this tradition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">Sahih Muslim (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/27/46">link</a>):</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">Abdullah Ibn Umar said: I heard Allah's Messenger say: He who beats a slave without <strong>cognizable</strong> offence of his or slaps him (without any serious fault), then expiation for it is that he should set him free.</blockquote>
<p class="western">So if the slave makes a mistake, then the master is still allowed to slap and beat him. This is important because it illustrates one of the most obvious differences between being an employee or a slave - the former can just walk away and get another job. If the latter walks away he can be beaten or worse, and forced back into service.</p>
<p class="western">Moreover, the freeing of slave (even in case of beating without any cognizable offence) is merely a <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>recommendation</strong></span>, and not an <span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong>obligation</strong></span>. This is evident from the heading provided by Imam Bukhari, which states, "<em><strong>Someone who slaps his slave should free him<span style="color: #e03e2d;"> even though he is under no obligation to do so</span></strong>.</em>" This same hadith is then recorded by him in his book al-Adab al-Mufrad.(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200921185303/https://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single/en_Adab_Al-Mufrad.pdf">link</a>).</p>
<p class="western">Imam Nawawi writes under the commentary of this tradition of Sahih Muslim (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230304123606/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;ID=5074&amp;bk_no=53&amp;flag=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم : من لطم مملوكه أو ضربه فكفارته أن يعتقه قال العلماء : في هذا الحديث الرفق بالمماليك ، وحسن صحبتهم وكف الأذى عنهم ، وكذلك في الأحاديث بعده ، <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">وأجمع</span> المسلمون</strong> على أن عتقه بهذا ليس واجبا ، وإنما هو مندوب رجاء كفارة ذنبه ، فيه إزالة إثم ظلمه . ومما استدلوا به لعدم وجوب إعتاقه : حديث سويد بن مقرن بعده : أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أمرهم حين لطم أحدهم خادمهم بعتقها ، قالوا : ليس لنا خادم غيرها ، قال : فليستخدموها ، فإذا استغنوا عنها فليخلوا سبيلها ، قال القاضي عياض : <strong>وأجمع العلماء</strong> أنه لا يجب إعتاق العبد لشيء مما يفعله به مولاه مثل هذا الأمر الخفيف ، قال : واختلفوا فيما كثر من ذلك وشنع ، من ضرب مبرح منهك لغير موجب لذلك ، أو حرقه بنار ، أو قطع عضوا له ، أو أفسده أو نحو ذلك مما فيه مثلة ، فذهب مالك وأصحابه والليث إلى عتق العبد على سيده بذلك ، ويكون ولاؤه له ، ويعاقبه السلطان على فعله ، وقال سائر العلماء : لا يعتق عليه .</p>
<p>The saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him: "Whoever slaps his slave or beats him, his expiation is to free him." The scholars have said regarding this Hadith: it emphasizes treating slaves kindly, good companionship with them, and protecting them from harm. Similarly, other Hadiths after this one emphasize the same point. The <strong>Muslim <span style="color: #e03e2d;">CONSENSUS</span> (IJMA' إجمأع)</strong> is that <strong>freeing the slave in this case is not obligatory</strong>, but rather <strong>it is (only) recommended</strong> as a way of seeking forgiveness for one's sin and removing the burden of one's wrongdoing. One of the reasons that scholars use to support the view that freeing the slave is not obligatory is the Hadith of Suwayd ibn Muqarrin which comes after this one, where the Prophet ordered the people to free a slave when one of them slapped their servant, and they replied that they had no other servant. The Prophet said: "Then let them use her, and when they no longer need her, set her free." Al-Qadi 'Iyad said: "The <strong>Scholars UNANIMOUSLY</strong> agree that <strong>freeing the slave is not obligatory for anything the master does to him, such as in this minor case</strong>." However, they have differed regarding more severe and heinous actions, such as beating the slave severely without any justification, burning him with fire, cutting off a limb, damaging him, or similar actions. Some scholars, such as Malik, his companions, and al-Layth, have said that in such (severe) cases, the slave should be freed from his master, and his allegiance should be to the one who freed him, and the ruler should punish the master for his actions. <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>Other scholars have said that freeing the slave is not obligatory (even) in such (severe) cases</strong></span>.</p>

<p class="western">And then again, we have a hadith in Sunan Abu Dawud, where Abu Bakr was beating his slave during the state of Ahraam (during Hajj), while the prophet was smiling and saying: Look at Abu Bakr, and what he is doing in the state of Ahraam.</p>

AbuBakr was sitting and waiting for his arrival. He arrived but he had no camel with him. He asked: Where is your camel? He replied: I lost it last night. AbuBakr said: There was only one camel, even that you have lost. <strong>He then began to beat him</strong> <strong>while the Messenger of Allah was smiling</strong> and saying: Look at this man who is in the sacred state (putting on ihram), what is he doing? Ibn AbuRizmah said: The Messenger of Allah spoke nothing except the words: Look at this man who is in the sacred state (wearing ihram), what is he doing? He was smiling (when he uttered these words).</p>

<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-7/Book-62/Hadith-132/">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5204</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet said, "None of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please also remember how brutally the Companions (i.e. Sahaba) used to beat their wives, even with bruises, even more than Arab pagans beat their wives. </p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5825/">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5825:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rifa`a divorced his wife whereupon `AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. `Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her <strong>a green spot</strong> (bruise) on her skin caused by severe beating). It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Apostle came, <strong>`Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women (i.e. even the non-Muslim men don't beat their non-believing women so brutally)</strong>.<strong> Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!</strong>" </p>

<p>There were many companions who became famous for beating their wives. Please read our article: <a href="https://sachaai.com//index.php/en/women-general/brutal-wife-beating-in-islam-recommendation-vs-actual-law">Wife Beating in Islam.</a></p>
<p>Thus, if Sharia allows men to beat their wives so brutally with bruises, then one can imagine how brutally they would have beaten their slaves. </p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId186861"></a>Islamic Excuse: It was <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NORMAL</span> back then</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Our Response:</strong></p>
<p>The argument that "it was okay back then" fundamentally contradicts the core concept of religion, which is divine guidance.</p>
<p>If we ultimately judge based on societal norms of the time, the relevance of divine guidance becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>Idolatry was once considered "normal." So why abolish it?</p>
<p>According to the Islamic narrative, killing infant girls was also deemed "normal" in the past. So why abolish it?</p>
<p>If we dismiss divine guidance by claiming that past norms determine what is acceptable, then why introduce any guidance at all?</p>
<p>Then just let the people go by their norms in all cases. What's with these double standards then?</p>
<p>One of the criticisms concerning Slavery in Islam is the direct involvement of Muhammad, who is considered by Allah and Muslims as the ultimate example for humanity, in slavery throughout his lifetime. Allah immortalized slavery by having his Messenger Muhammad take part in it. He had multiple slave women for sex, despite having more than 9 wives. He kept enjoying those slave women for his entire life, and he didn't free them. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">At the very least Allah could have prevented his Prophet from being a part of it. But nope.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anyone attempting to assert that Islam abolished or discouraged Slavery is simply deceiving themselves in an effort to hold onto their faith. There is no truth to such claims.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId127775"></a>Muslim Excuse: Islam enslaved innocent women and children to provide them with <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">PROTECTION</span></h2>
<p class="western">Women and small children had no role in the wars, and they were totally innocent of any crime. But still, Allah/Muhammad enslaved them, and that too for their entire life. </p>
<p class="western">Why?</p>
<p class="western">The Muslim excuse is that women and children could not be left ALONE on their own (after their all men being killed or enslaved). They needed protection. So, Islam enslaved them only to provide them with "<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>PROTECTION</strong></span>". </p>
<p class="western">But this is a very lame excuse. </p>
<p class="western">Look, captive women wanted protection: so that:</p>
<ul>
<li>So that no one would have made them slaves for their entire lives.</li>
<li>So that no one would have raped them.</li>
<li>So that no one could made them to stand naked in slave markets and sold there. </li>
<li>So that multiple men didn't use them as sex objects by raping them in temporary sexual relationships.</li>
<li>So that no one would have compelled them to do forced labour work for their entire lives.</li>
<li>So that their children could not be taken away from them and then sold in slave markets.</li>
<li>So that their babies would not automatically born as slaves (due to the evil of "Slavery by Birth" in Islam).</li>
</ul>
<p class="western">But the problem is that<strong> Islam is itself committing exactly "<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">All These CRIMES</span>" against the captive women in the name of “protection”. Yes, Islam made women and children slaves for their entire lives, made their rape HALAL by multiple masters in temporary sexual relationships, made them stand naked in slave markets, forced labour work, took away their children and even small 6-months-old babies and sold them in slave markets. </strong></p>
<p class="western">No woman in her right mind would sleep with a man the same night, when he had killed her father, husband, brother or sons the same day.  </p>
<p class="western">If Islam really wanted to give protection to the captive women, then it should have not <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>LOOTED</strong></span> all of their wealth in the name of <strong>war booty</strong>.</p>
<p class="western">If Islam really wanted to give protection to these women, then it would have allowed them to go to their relatives in other cities, or to marry a person of their own choice. </p>
<p class="western">Instead, Islam took their small children too as slaves for their entire lives and then separated them from their mothers, and then sold them in the slave markets.</p>
<p class="western">Is all this oppression by Islam, really a “Protection”?</p>
<p class="western">Look at the following Hadith, where women didn't want any protection, but they were trying to <strong>escape</strong>, but Muslims caught them to disrobe them and rape them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">Sahih Muslim, Hadith <a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1755">1755</a>:</p>

I saw a group of persons that consisted of women and children. <strong>I was afraid lest they should reach the mountain before me, so I shot an arrow between them and the mountain. When they saw the arrow, they stopped.</strong> So I brought them, driving them along. Among them was a woman from Banu Fazara. She was wearing a leather coat. With her was her daughter who was one of the prettiest girls in Arabia. I drove them along until I brought them to Abu Bakr <strong>who bestowed that girl upon me as a prize</strong>. So we arrived in Medina. I had not yet <strong>disrobed her (i.e. raped her)</strong> when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) met me in the street and said: Give me that girl, O Salama. I said: Messenger of Allah, she has fascinated me. I had not yet <strong>disrobed her</strong>. When on the next day the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) again met me in the street, he said: O Salama, give me that girl, may God bless your father. I said: She is for you, Messenger of Allah! By Allah. I have not yet <strong>disrobed her</strong>.</span></p>

<h3>A non-Mulsim slave should not be freed, and also not fed:</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/514760">Muwatta Imam Malik, Book 38, Hadith 1477</a>:</p>

<p>Malik said, "The best of what I have heard on the obligation of freeing slaves is that <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>it is not permitted to free a christian or a jew to fulfil it</strong></span>, and one does not free a mukatab or a mudabbar or an umm walad or a slave to be freed after a certain number of years, or a blind person.

<p>Malik said, "As for obligations of freeing slaves which Allah has mentioned in the Book,<strong> one only frees a mumin slave for them</strong>."</p>
<p>Malik said, "It is like that in feeding poor people for kaffara. <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>One must only feed muslims and one does not feed anyone outside of the deen of Islam</strong></span>."</p>

<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId825804"></a>Islamic Claim: It was only the achievement of Islam to give freedom to the “Umm Walad” (i.e. slave woman who gives birth to the owner’s child)</h2>
<p>Another deception perpetrated by Islamic apologists is their claim that Islam was solely responsible for granting freedom to slave women who had given birth to their owner's child (referred to as Umm Walad in Islam). However, there are several important points to consider:</p>
<p>Firstly, it is entirely false to assert that this was an exclusive achievement of Islam. Many pre-Islamic cultures practiced this custom more effectively than Islam.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is a false claim by Islamic apologists that Islamic Sharia mandated the liberation of Umm Walad. Neither Allah nor Muhammad ordered it in the Quran or Hadith. In fact, during Muhammad's time, these slave mothers did not receive freedom. Owners had full authority to separate them from their children and sell them to other owners. The owner was also permitted to marry the slave mother of his child to another person or one of his slaves, even against her consent. Upon the owner's death, she was inherited by all the owner's children, sold, and the proceeds were divided among them.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it was the later 2nd Caliph Umar Ibn Khattab who, after being exposed to other civilized cultures of his time, realized that they showed more respect towards such slave mothers. As a result, Umar Ibn Khattab introduced this innovation (Bid'ah) into Sharia. He decreed that Umm Walad should not be sold and would remain a slave during the owner's lifetime. The owner was still permitted to marry her off to others or to one of his slaves, even against her consent. However, upon the owner's death, she would be granted freedom and not be inherited by all of the owner's children.</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3954">Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 3954</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="western">Jabir bin `Abdullah siad: “We used to sell our slave women and the mothers of our children when the Prophet was still living among us, and we did not see anything wrong with that.”<br>Grade: Sahih (Darussalam)</blockquote>
<p class="western">And although Umar Ibn Khattab gave freedom to Umm Walad after the death of the owner, still the owner was allowed to marry her to any person (even without her consent) (Reference: <a href="https://archive.org/details/fatawaalamgiriurduvolume6/page/n161/mode/2up">Fatwa Alamgiri, vol. 6, page 162</a>)</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Islam, the master was permitted to deny the parentage of his own child born from his concubine, preventing the concubine from attaining the status of Umm Walad.</p>
<p>It is truly distressing to consider the idea that a father could disavow the parentage of his own son or daughter, subsequently treating them as a slave and even selling them in the slave market. Yet, this was the practice allowed in Islam, as Muhammad adopted the laws of the uncivilized Arab society of his time rather than those of Moses.</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2746">Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 2746</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="western">… a child from a slave woman cannot be named after his father if the man whom he claimed as his father did not acknowledge him.<br>Imam Albani declared this Hadith as Fair (Hasan). <a href="https://dorar.net/h/a6817490272ab84d27fbb906c32ceb1a">Link</a>.<br>This same tradition has also been narrated by Amr bin Shoaib in Sunnan Abdu Dawud, and has again been graded as Hasan (<a href="https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/83608">link</a>).</blockquote>
<p class="western">Moreover, we have already observed that the Bible, specifically in Deuteronomy, Chapter 21 (<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/DEU.21.niv">link</a>), stated that if Jews/Christians wished to marry their slave women, they would automatically become permanent wives and could not be further sold. Consequently, the issue of Umm Walad did not exist among Jews and Christians.</p>
<p>Once again, Muhammad deviated from the Laws of Moses and instead followed the customs of the uncivilized Arab culture concerning Umm Walad.</p>
<p>Likewise, when Buddhist states abolished the system of slavery and introduced serfdom, the problem of Umm Walad vanished completely.</p>
<p>By comparing the Islamic system with different cultures regarding Umm Walad, it becomes evident that there was no unique achievement of Islam in this regard. In fact, original Islam (until the era of Umar Ibn Khattab) can be held accountable for its mistreatment of Umm Walad as well.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId370442"></a>Islamic Claim: It was only the achievement of Islam to Introduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukataba">Mukataba</a> (مكاتبة) i.e. “Contract of Manumission”</h2>
<p>In Mukataba, a slave is obligated to pay a specified amount of money within a specific timeframe in order to attain freedom.</p>
<p>Islamic apologists assert that it was only Islam that introduced this revolutionary concept, wherein slaves had the opportunity to obtain their freedom through Mukataba.</p>
<p>Firstly, once again, Islamic apologists are misleading people by spreading falsehoods. The practice of emancipation through contractual agreements was not a novel concept but had already been customary in societies that existed for thousands of years prior to Islam.</p>
<p>Even the pre-Islamic uncivilized Arab culture had a tradition of Mukataba, which Muhammad simply adopted from them (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130118230813/http://mubashirnazir.org/ER/Slavery/L0018-06-Slavery.htm">link</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, slaves were able to engage in "contracts of manumission" as early as 1000 years before the advent of Islam (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome">link</a>).</p>
<p>Secondly, according to Islam, it was not mandatory for the owner to agree to Mukataba if the slave requested it. Instead, it was at the discretion of the owner to either accept or reject the proposal.</p>
<p class="western">Muwatta Imam Malik (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200921113542/https://ahadith.co.uk/chapter.php?cid=89">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">Malik said, "What is done among us is that the owner of a slave does not have to give his slave a kitaba if he asks for it. I have not heard of any of the Imams forcing a man to give a kitaba to his slave. "</blockquote>
<p>Note: Malik is not issuing a Fatwa in this instance, but rather discussing the IJMA' (unanimous consensus) of the entire Muslim society during his time (and before him). This consensus held that it was not obligatory for owners to engage in Mukataba with their slaves.</p>
<p>For further information, you can read more about it <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukataba#Early_Islam">here.</a></p>
<p class="western">In summary, Islam did not introduce Mukataba as it is often portrayed today. Instead, this practice already existed in various cultures, and Muhammad simply adopted it from the pre-Islamic Arab culture.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId623009"></a>Islamic Claim: Islam “<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">gradually</span>” ended slavery</h2>
<p class="western">Again, this is a lie.</p>
<p>Once again, this claim is false.</p>
<p>Islam never "gradually" ended slavery, and its 1400-year history stands as evidence of this fact.</p>
<p>In reality, Islam only witnessed an "increase" in slavery over time. If there were thousands of slaves during Muhammad's era, their numbers grew to hundreds of thousands during the reign of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs, and then expanded to millions under subsequent Islamic Caliphates.</p>
<p>The truth is that as Islam gained power, the number of slaves also continued to rise.</p>
<p>Muhammad never issued any orders stating that slavery should be gradually abolished if the economy and conditions allowed for it. Not only did he fail to end slavery on a state level, but he also did not gradually put an end to the practice within his own household, despite having no need for slaves (as he already had 9 wives). Muhammad had 4 female slaves, which he kept for sex slavery. </p>
<p>Ibn al-Qayyim recorded in his book Zaad al-Ma’aad (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220509160304/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;idfrom=21&amp;idto=21&amp;bk_no=127&amp;ID=23">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>قال أبو عبيدة : كان له أربع : مارية وهي أم ولده إبراهيم ، وريحانة وجارية أخرى جميلة أصابها في بعض السبي ، وجارية وهبتها له <span class="names">زينب بنت جحش </span>.</p>
<p>Abu ‘Ubaydah said: He had four (concubines): Mariyah, who was the mother of his son Ibraaheem; Rayhaanah; another beautiful slave woman whom he acquired as a prisoner of war; and a slave woman who was given to him by Zaynab bint Jahsh. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is incomprehensible how Islamic apologists can propagate such a falsehood that Islam gradually ended slavery.</p>
<p>Please consider this question: Why didn't God make it explicitly clear to abolish slavery, given its inhumane nature, similar to how He provided numerous verses about dietary restrictions, prohibitions on drinking, and the avoidance of zina (adultery and fornication)? Are these actions considered more severe than the practice of owning slaves?</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId742687"></a>Islamic Claim: Islam ended all other sources of slavery, except for wars</h2>
<p>Once again, these claims are entirely false.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> it is important to note that many societies prior to Islam had already outlawed slavery resulting from kidnapping, such as the Buddhists, Zoroastrians of Iran, Jews, and Christians, among others.</li>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> Islam did not prohibit the root cause of the "Slave Trade". Muslims were fully allowed to travel to other countries and purchase enslaved women, exploiting them for their own sexual desires through rape.</li>
<li>Muslims not only bought enslaved women but also acquired numerous eunuchs, who were employed in the harems of Muslim rulers and wealthy individuals to exert control over the hundreds and thousands of concubines present. Astonishingly, all of this was considered permissible (Halal-Allah), and no Islamic scholar ever issued a Fatwa prohibiting it.</li>
<li><strong>Thirdly,</strong> Islam perpetuated the system of "<strong>Slavery by Birth</strong>". According to Islamic Sharia, all children born to enslaved parents were automatically deemed slaves themselves. Islamic preachers may attempt to conceal this truth, but their efforts are dishonest.</li>
<li><strong>Fourthly,</strong> why did Islam make innocent captive small children slaves for their entire lives? Small children (just like women) had no role in wars. They were completely innocent. But Muhammad still turned those innocent captive children into slaves for their entire lives. Why? What kind of Divine Justice is it? Not only this, but later coming generations of those innocent children were also born as slaves due to the Evil of "Slavery by Birth" in Islam.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Evil Slavery By Birth in Islam:</strong></span></p>
<p class="western">One of the biggest evils of Islam was "<strong>Slavery by Birth</strong>". All the children of slave men and women were automatically born as slaves (except in this case when the father was the owner himself). </p>
<p>And the next big evil of Islam was that owners were allowed to separate the children from their parents, and then sell them in the slave markets (or he kept the child and sold the father or mother or both in the market. In both cases, the separation between the children and the parents took place). </p>
<p>Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (also known as the younger Imam Malik) wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf">link 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117184347/http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/RISALA.htm">link 2</a>):</p>

<p class="western">The anguish experienced by a mother is indescribable when her six-month-old baby is forcibly taken away from her and sold in the slave market.</p>
<p class="western">Even the slave mothers of the owner's own children (i.e. أم الولد) were also not exempt from this cruelty. They too were separated from their children and sold in the slave markets, leaving behind a trail of heartbreak and despair. </p>

<p>Once again, we witness the distressing separation between parents and children, with the only distinction being that in this case, it is the mothers who are being sold instead of the babies.</p>
<p>This is the grim reality that unfolded over the course of 1400 years in Islamic history. A history marred by the tragic separation of countless babies from their slave mothers, who were then traded and sold in the desolate slave markets.</p>

<p>Once again, this claim is also not entirely accurate. Islam did indeed grant Muslims full permission to purchase and utilize eunuchs through the slave trade from other countries for their harems.</p>
<p>As a result of the significant demand from Muslim slave traders, thousands of slaves underwent castration to become eunuchs.</p>
<p class="western">Moreover, there was absolutely no Qisas punishment for the owner for <strong><em>CASTRATING</em></strong> the slave boy and cutting his nose:</p>

When the messenger died, then that slave boy came to Abu Bakr and told him about the testament of messenger. Abu Bakr said: "Yes I remember it. Let me give share of meny to you and your family from Bait-ul-Mal."

<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Zoroastrian religion has no direct teachings about castration or even about slavery (although slavery existed due to wars). However, there were no widespread use of Eunuchs in their society, as Muslims used them in Harems and in their societies).</span></li>

<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId168266"></a>Islamic Claim: Quran orders to set the captives free either as Ihsaan (i.e. favour) or after taking ransom money</h2>
<p class="western">Islamistss also claim that Allah abolished slavery completely in the Qruan:</p>
<blockquote class="western">(Quran <a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=47&amp;vid=4">47:4</a>) So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, smite the necks; then, when you have overcome them, make (them) prisoners, <strong>and afterwards (set them free) as a favour or for ransom.</strong></blockquote>
<p class="western">This is again a deception by Islamic apologists. They don’t tell the background of this verse, or all the incidents which happened after this verse.</p>
<p class="western"><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>In the 2nd Hijri year, the Battle of Badr took place, resulting in the death of 70 polytheists from Mecca and the capture of another 70.</p>
<p>Since the Muslims had never before encountered such a situation, they were unsure about how to handle the prisoners.</p>
<p>Abu Bakr proposed that the Muslims should accept ransom money for the captives and then release them. This way, the Muslims would acquire wealth, and the people of Mecca would also not seek revenge.</p>
<p>However, Umar Ibn Khattab opposed Abu Bakr's suggestion and proposed that all the prisoners should be executed. He even went so far as to suggest that Ali Ibn Abi Talib should execute his own brother Aqeel, who fought on the side of the Meccans. Umar himself was willing to kill his own relatives, and he also mentioned the execution of Hamza and Abbas, who were the real uncles of Muhammad and had fought on the side of the Meccans. It is important to note that these individuals held leadership positions among the polytheists.</p>
<p>However, Prophet Muhammad did not agree with the suggestion to kill his uncles Hamza and Abbas due to his personal relationship with them. Instead, Muhammad ordered that ransom money should be accepted, and the prisoners should be set free, following Abu Bakr's proposal <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(Reference: </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190206023521/http://www.hadithurdu.com/02/2-3-91/">Sahih Muslim</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200915114148/http://www.hadithurdu.com/musnad-ahmad/11-1-216/">Musnad Ahmed bin Hanbal</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">).</span></p>
<p class="western">Ibn Kathir recorded a tradition under the commentary of verse 8:67, how Muhammad was worried about his uncles.</p>
<p class="western"><a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=8&amp;tAyahNo=67&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">Tafsir Ibn Kathir, verse 8:67</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="western">Abbas was captured by one Ansari man, and Ansars wanted to kill Abbas. When prophet Muhammad came to know about it, he said that he was unable to sleep due to the worry that Abbas would be killed. Upon that Umar asked him if he was allowed to go to the Ansar? Muhammad gave him the permission. Umar then came to Ansar and asked them to set Abbas free. Ansar replied that they would not set him free. Umar told them that Prophet Muhammad wanted him to become free. Upon that Ansar told Umar to took Abbas with him as they set him free happily (as Ahsaan) for the sake of Prophet Muhammad.</blockquote>
<p>During that period, Muhammad asserted that Allah revealed verse 47:4, which stated that prisoners could be set free as an act of favor or in exchange for ransom money.</p>
<p>However, after Abbas had been released, Muhammad's perspective shifted. He desired vengeance against the other Meccans who were not his relatives.</p>
<p>As a result, Muhammad claimed that the earlier verse 47:4 had been abrogated by a new verse, 8:67. This new verse mandated the killing of a lot of prisoners, superseding the previous instruction to set them free.</p>
<blockquote class="western">(Quran <a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=8&amp;vid=67">8:67</a>) It is not fit for any Prophet to have prisoners until he make wide slaughter (of them) in the land. Ye desire the lure of this world (by taking the ransom money) but Allah desireth (for you) the Hereafter.</blockquote>
<p>Please bear in mind that the killing of "prisoners" is not only considered a war crime in modern times, but even the Arabs of that era of ignorance found it to be abhorrent.</p>
<p>Some Muslim scholars have attempted to defend this practice by suggesting it was an exception during the Battle of Badr. However, this is incorrect, as Muhammad later ordered the killing of 800 men from the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayzah, even after they had already surrendered and become prisoners.</p>
<p>The Battle of Badr occurred in the 2nd Hijri year, and Muhammad went on to engage in dozens more wars, capturing thousands of prisoners. However, he did not grant freedom to these captives as a gesture of kindness. Instead, they were permanently enslaved along with their young children. Therefore, it is a blatant falsehood propagated by Islamic apologists to claim that Muhammad abolished slavery by setting all war captives free as an act of favor or through ransom.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId155427"></a>Islamic Claim: The captives of Banu al-Mustaliq and the Tribe of Hawazin were set free as "<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Favour احسان</span>"</h2>
<p class="western">Islamists claim that captives of Banu al-Mutaliq were set free as a favour. And they present the following tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">Sunnan Abu Dawud (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201213123712/http://www.hadithurdu.com/03/3-3-540/">link</a>):<br>The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to Juwayriyyah: Are you inclined to that which is better? She asked: What is that, Apostle of Allah? He replied: I shall pay the price of your freedom on your behalf, and I shall marry you. She said: I shall do this. She (Aisha) said: The people then heard that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had married Juwayriyyah. They released the captives in their possession and set them free, and said: They are the relatives of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) by marriage. We did not see any woman greater than Juwayriyyah who brought blessings to her people. One hundred families of Banu al-Mustaliq were set free on account of her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>The first issue is that this tradition was narrated by Ibn Ishaq using "'An عن". According to the standards of Islamists themselves, such traditions from Ibn Ishaq are considered weak and not authentic. This is why the commentator of Sunan Abu Dawud criticizes this tradition in his book "Awn al-Ma'bud (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213124912/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=55&amp;amp;ID=6828">link</a>)" by stating: "(عن ابن إسحاق) هو محمد بن إسحاق بن يسار وروايته عند المؤلف بالعنعنة".</p>
<p>The second problem is that other Islamist "traditions" tell a different story. One tradition claims that it was the relatives of the Jewish women who paid the ransom money to set them free. Another "tradition" suggests that even Juwayriyyah was not set free as an act of "favour احسان" by Muhammad, but rather it was the Jewish father of Juwayriyyah who paid the ransom for her and set her free. You can read these traditions here (<a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=gZknAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=Ishaaq+Mustaliq+freed+prisoners+marriage+Juwayriya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2YKEgs8Bwn&amp;sig=ACfU3U0PbnonmCK2UsFgQz0J_KQWRG5_OA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjb4PG1icvtAhVHqaQKHaxiByoQ6AEwBnoECAkQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ishaaq%20Mustaliq%20freed%20prisoners%20marriage%20Juwayriya&amp;f=false">link</a>). It was not difficult for Islamists to fabricate traditions in order to portray the greatness of Islam. However, contradictions among these traditions serve as evidence that they were fabricated by Islamists.</p>
<p>The third problem is that Muhammad also married Safiyyah, but there is no such tradition stating that Muslims set all the slave women of Khaybar free because of Safiyyah. Therefore, this further indicates that the stories about setting slaves free in the case of Juwayriyyah's marriage are merely fabrications.</p>
<p>The fourth problem is that even if it is accepted that Muslims set 100 slave women of Banu al-Mustaliq free, it would still be an "exceptional" case where the reason for their freedom was not "Love for Slaves," but rather it was primarily out of RESPECT and HONOUR for their own prophet. For example, when Sobiyyah, a slave woman, brought the news of Muhammad's birth to Abu Lahab, he set her free out of love for his nephew.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would have been considered an act of "Love for Slaves" if slaves from every tribe had been set free without any marriage of Muhammad within that tribe.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId744"></a>How did prisoners of the tribe of Hawazin become free:</h2>
<p>Islamists also claim that slave women from the tribe of Hawazin were set free as an act of favor. However, this claim is also untrue. The women of Hawazin were actually granted freedom as a means of "reconciliation" with the tribe. The tribe of Hawazin had recently converted to Islam, and there was a fear that they might abandon the religion and potentially wage war against Muhammad.</p>
<p>The background of this incident is that initially, the tribe of Hawazin had rejected Islam. In response, Muhammad launched an attack on them and besieged their fortress for 15 days, but failed to capture it. He then returned to Mecca.</p>
<p>In Mecca, people accepted Islam out of fear of Muhammad's power. As a result, there was no longer anyone in Arabia who possessed the strength to fight against the Muslims or assist the tribe of Hawazin. Muhammad also provided "stipends" to the newly converted people of Mecca as a form of bribery, in order to prevent them from leaving Islam and reverting to their previous religion (Quran Verse <a href="http://quranx.com/9.60">9:60</a>).</p>
<p>When the tribe of Hawazin heard about this, they considered converting to Islam in hopes that Muhammad would show them favor as new converts and free their women (who had been captured in an earlier war by Muhammad). They sent a delegation to Muhammad, stating that they would accept Islam if he agreed to release their women and return their belongings that had been taken as war booty.</p>
<p>Muhammad, on one hand, sought to reconcile their hearts as a bribe to prevent them from initiating a war against the Muslims. However, he also did not wish to relinquish all the spoils of war. Therefore, he gave them a choice between the freedom of their women or retaining the war booty. They chose the freedom of their women.</p>
<p>Thus, the women of Hawazin were not set free as an act of "favor to slaves," but rather as a bribe to appease the tribe and prevent further conflict with the Muslims.</p>
<p>You can read the complete account of the Hawazin incident here (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/57/40">link</a>). </p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId309588"></a>A challenge to Islam apologists: Why were the prisoners (women) of Banu Qurayzah or Khaybar not set free as "Favour"?</h2>
<p>Can Islamists demonstrate that the female and child prisoners from Banu Qurayzah or Khybar were also released as an act of favor?</p>
<p>If not, then please enlighten us on the crime committed by these individuals that resulted in them not being granted freedom as a gesture of kindness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even Muhammad himself did not free the female prisoner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayhana_bint_Zayd">Rayhana bint Zayd</a>, as an act of favor. Instead, Muhammad claimed her as his share of the war booty. Rayhana's offense was her refusal to convert to Islam and her adherence to her original Jewish faith. Consequently, Muhammad retained her as a slave for the entirety of her life and had sex with her as her master. </p>
<p>So, when Muhammad himself didn't release Rayhayna from slavery but kept on driving sex enjoyment from her, despite having multiple other wives, how could then we expect other Muslims to release their slaves them as a favour to them?</p>
<p>The same thing happened with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_al-Qibtiyya">Maria al-Qibtiyya</a>, who was presented to Muhammad as a slave. And Muhammad didn't set her free as a favour, but kept her as a slave whole of his life and had sex with her, despite having multiple wives. </p>
<p>Islamists often cite the following tradition too as an indication of Islam's greatness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western"><a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1956">Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 1956</a>:<br>Messenger of Allah P.B.U.H said: "Whoever has a slave woman and teaches her good manners and educates her, then sets her free and marries her, will have two rewards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue at hand is that Muhammad himself did not free Maria, marry her, or act in accordance with this tradition. This serves as evidence that the tradition is fabricated.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, it was effortless for Islamists to invent such traditions to falsely highlight the excellence of Islam.</p>
<p>These deceitful Islamic apologists also concocted other traditions claiming that Muhammad did, in fact, free and marry Maria and Rayhana. However, these traditions have been contradicted by other Islamists themselves, while more authentic traditions indicate the contrary—that Muhammad kept them as slaves throughout his lifetime.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId156735"></a>Islamic Claim: Raping the captive women was not a crime, as other Nations also did the same</h2>
<p>What kind of argument is it to suggest that if others committed crimes against those vulnerable women and children, then those crimes against humanity also became permissible for Prophet Muhammad?</p>
<p>Even if the men from both sides engaged in combat, the non-combatant civilians, women, and young children were innocent and should not have been subjected to a lifetime of slavery. In many cases, these individuals did not participate in the fighting; rather, it was Muhammad and the Muslims who initiated the attacks in order to obtain war spoils.</p>
<p>Humanity rejects any law that holds innocent women and children accountable for the actions of combatant men. Even the non-Muslim men who were combatants did not deserve to be killed or enslaved. Yet, it was Islam that commanded Muslims to launch offensive Jihad against other non-Muslim tribes and nations, capturing them as spoils of war.</p>
<p class="western">European nations captured all the Islamic countries during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, but they didn’t rape Muslim women. You have to be thankful for the non-religious Western nations of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, who abolished slavery only for the sake of humanity, and this ultimately saved Muslim women from being raped.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId292710"></a>Islamic Claim: A Muslim owner cannot have sex with a polytheist slave woman</h2>
<p class="western">Some Islamists claim that Muslims were allowed to rape only those women slaves, who were either Muslims or Jews or Christians, while it was not allowed for the owner to have sex with the polytheist slave woman.</p>
<p class="western">But again, this claim is false. Just look at the following tradition of Sahih Muslim, which makes it clear that the Quran allowed the raping of captive women, who were polytheists.</p>
<p class="western">Sahih Muslim (<a href="https://www.sunnah.com/muslim/17/41">link</a>):</p>

<blockquote class="quotation-english">Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah her pleased with him) reported that at the Battle of Hanain Allah's Messenger sent an army to Autas and encountered the enemy and fought with them. Having overcome them and taken them captives, the Companions of Allah's Messenger seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women<strong class="western"> because of their husbands being polytheists.</strong> Then Allah, Most High, sent down regarding that:" And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess (Verse 4:24)" <strong class="western">(i. e. they were lawful for them when their 'Idda period came to an end, even if they were polytheists themselves)</strong>.</blockquote>
<p class="western">The people of Autas were polytheists, and their wives too. But the Quran openly told Muslims that they could have sex with those polytheist women of Autas, even if their husbands were alive, while Muslims had become their owners.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="western">Most of the slave women owned by the Companions were from the polytheist Arabs and it is known that they were idol-worshippers; they did not hold that it was impermissible for them to be intimate with them. It has not been reported that the Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, deemed it unlawful and he, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, never forbade any of the Companions from being intimate with their polytheistic slave women.</p>

<p class="western">Contrary to the practice of Sahaba in the presence of Muhammad (i.e. having sex with polytheist slave women), som Islamic Scholars later claimed that one cannot have sex with his slave woman if she is neither a Muslim nor from the people of the book (i.e. Christian/Jew/Magian). But there are two issues with their claim:</p>
<ol>
<li class="western">Firstly, there is not a <strong>single</strong> Hadith from Muhammad that forbade having sex with polytheist slave women. </li>
<li class="western">Secondly, their only proof is their claim that verse <a href="https://quranx.com/2.221?Context=3">2.221</a> (Surah Baqara) abrogated verse 4.24 which allowed them to have intercourse with polytheist slave women after the battle of Autas. But Surah Baqara factually cannot abrogate it as it was revealed earlier during the initial period of Medina, while the <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9_%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%B3">battle of Autas</a> took place after the victory of Mecca (8th Hijri year). </li>
<li class="western">Thirdly, the <strong>MOTIVE</strong> of these Scholars was to <strong>FORCE</strong> polytheist slave women to <strong>CONVERT</strong> to Islam.</li>
</ol>
<p>Imam Malik (the founder of the Maliki school of thought, and a tabi' tabi'in) was asked about the permissibility of intercourse with a captive polytheist young girl (<a href="https://shamela.ws/book/587/729">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="c5">قُلْتُ:</span> أَرَأَيْتَ إنْ اشْتَرَى صَبِيَّةً مِثْلُهَا يُجَامَعُ أَوَّلًا يُجَامَعُ مِثْلُهَا وَهِيَ فِي هَذَا كُلِّهِ لَمْ تَحِضْ وَهِيَ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ، أَوْ صَارَتْ فِي سُهْمَانِهِ، أَيَطَؤُهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ تُجِيبَ إلَى الْإِسْلَامِ؟<span class="c5"> قَالَ:</span> أَمَّا مَنْ عَرَفَتْ الْإِسْلَامَ مِنْهُنَّ فَإِنِّي أَرَى أَنْ لَا يَطَأَهَا حَتَّى يُجْبِرَهَا عَلَى الْإِسْلَامِ وَتَدْخُلَ فِيهِ إذَا كَانَتْ قَدْ عَقَلَتْ مَا يُقَالُ لَهَا</p>
<p>... He said: I believe that he should not have intercourse with her (a polytheist slave girl) until he forces her to accept Islam and she accepts it, provided she understands what is being said to her. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>WikiIslam.Net provide this reference (link):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a report included in the <em>Jāmi‘</em> of al-Khallāl (d. 311 A.H. / 923 A.D.), <strong>Ibn Hanbal maintained that:</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt><em><strong>if Zoroastrian and idolatrous women are taken prisoner, they are coerced into Islam; if they embrace it, sexual relations with them are permissible</strong> and they can (also) be used as maidservants. If they do not embrace Islam, they are used as maidservants but not for sexual relations (wa idhā subhīna (sic) al-majūsiyyāt wa ‘abadat al awthān ujbirna 'alā al-Islām fa-in asl ama wutiʼna ma 'stukhdimna wa in lam yuslimna 'stukhdimna wa lam yūtaʼna).</em></dt>
</dl>
<p>The contradiction inherent in this passage is evident: despite the unspecified coercive measures, some of the women in question refused conversion and, consequently, the masters could not take full advantage of their services. If the only way to embrace Islam is pronouncing the declaration of faith, the conversion of a defiant woman may not be possible: it is not always feasible to force someone to utter the shahāda. <strong>According to a tradition transmitted on the authority of Hasan al-Basri, the Muslims used various devices to attain their objective: they turned the Zorastrian slave-girl toward the Ka‘ba, ordered her to pronounce the shahāda and to perform ablution. Her master then engaged in sexual relations</strong> after she had one menstruating period while in his house. Others hold that the master must teach the slave-girl to pray, to purify herself and to shave her private parts before any intercourse. The participation of the girl in this procedure is minimal, and this wording may be interpreted us a considerable lowering of the conversion requirements so that the girl becomes eligible for sexual intercourse as expeditiously as possible. Among the early traditionists, only <strong>a few were willing to go beyond this and allow sexual relations with a Zoroastrian slave-girl without insisting on at least a semblance of conversion</strong>.</p>
<p>Shafi‘i's treatment of the issue is slightly different. Speaking of grown-up Zoroastrian or polytheist women taken into captivity, he maintains that no sexual relations with them are allowed before they embrace Islam without bringing up the question of converting them forcibly. If the female captives are minor but were taken captive with at least one of their parents, the ruling is the same. <strong>If, however, the girl was captured without her parents, or one of her parents embraced Islam, she is considered a Muslim and is coerced into embracing it</strong> (<em>nahkumu lahā bihukm al-Islām wa nujbiruhā ‘alayhi</em>). <strong>Once this happens, sexual relations with her are lawful.</strong></p>

<p class="western">To be a non-believer and then be forced into Islam by one's master does not entail obedience from the slave in that matter, as there is no compulsion in religion. Al-Halimi, from the Shafi'i school, made an exception for a non-Kitabiya (non-people of the book) female slave whose master desires to enjoy her and compels her to Islam to make her lawful for him. Al-Halimi considered this permissible to remove the obstacle from sexual intercourse. He compared it to the permissibility of forcing her to remove impurities and perform ritual bathing after menstruation.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId233987"></a>Islamic Claim: Islam provided “human rights” to the slaves</h2>
<p class="western">Feeding a slave does not come under the category of giving him his “human rights”. Not only slaves, but prisoners are get the right to be fed in the prisons. And people are also responsible for feeding their pet animals at home.</p>
<p class="western">While “basic human rights” are those, which make all humans “equal”.</p>
<p class="western">The truth is that Islam never provided the “basic human rights” to the slaves, but it deprived them of many of their human rights.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId330095"></a>Message:</h2>
<p>Please bear in mind that the system of an infallible Allah should also be absolutely flawless. If we observe Allah acting against the principles of humanity in even a single instance, it undermines the entire foundation of Islam.</p>
<p>Being 100% perfect means achieving true perfection without any room for error, not settling for 99.99%.</p>
<p>No entity claiming to be God can be accepted if it demonstrates injustice and oppression in even a single case. Unfortunately, Allah, as depicted by Muslims, bears responsibility for the oppression endured by millions of enslaved men, women, and children over the past 1400 years.</p>
<p>A perpetual struggle exists within each individual between "religion" and "humanity."</p>
<p>Let us not become like those individuals who sacrifice humanity in the name of religion.</p>
<p>Instead, let us embrace and champion humanity.</p>
<p>Let us stand in support of humanity.</p>
<p>Let us take the side of humanity.</p>

			<title>ٰIslamic Excuse: Slavery was not abolished due to ongoing Wars</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/islamic-slavery/islamic-excuse-slavery-was-not-abolished-due-to-ongoing-wars</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Where there is a will, there is a way. The Western world also abolished slavery despite World wars 1 and 2. But Islam not only didn't abolish slavery, but it even usurped many human rights, which could be very easily given to slaves.</p>
<p>Muslim preachers come up with this excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look how the black African American slaves, after being set free by the 13th Amendment, suffered and some of them died after being freed. Thus Islam couldn't abolish slavery because then the slaves would suffer the same fate as the black American slaves.</p>
<p>Simlialry, every war brought slaves, and Muslims could not have abolished it one-sidedly, when Kuffars were also enslaving Muslims after wars. </p>
<p>Moreover, the economy was directly linked with slavery, and it was impossible to completely abolish slavery, and to give freedom to all slaves who were the private properties of their owners, who bought them from slave markets. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, the Muslim argument about African American slaves holds no value. Slavery was also abolished in the whole of Europe, but no such problem occurred in Europe. Actually, The British Empire also abolished slavery from all its colonies all over the world, and still, slaves faced no such problems in those colonies. </p>
<p>Actually, it was the "<strong>Racial Prejudice</strong>" of the white supremacists in America, which played the most important role in bringing hardships to African American Slaves later after their emancipation. The question is if Sahaba (i.e. companions of Muhammad) also had such "Racial Prejudice" against all slaves that Allah/Muhammad feared and thus didn't dare to emancipate slaves in the Islamic state.</p>
<p>Secondly and most importantly, if ongoing wars were bringing more slaves every time, still Allah/Muhammad could have given slaves more human rights, which could have reduced their sufferings. But Allah/Muhammad failed miserably in providing the slaves with even <strong>basic human rights</strong>. </p>
<p>For example, Ashoka the Great of India was also not able to completely eradicate slavery due to ongoing wars. However, he successfully eliminated all forms of <strong>slave trade</strong> and <strong>slave markets</strong> within India.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some basic human rights, which Allah/Muhammad could have very easily provided to slaves, and his companions would have not rebelled against Allah/Muhammad. The economy of the Islamic State would have also not collapsed due to those basic human rights:</p>
<ol class="_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP">
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p><span>Allah/Muhammad had the authority to provide choices for captive women, such as: (a) granting them and their children freedom to return to their relatives, as they were innocent and did not deserve lifelong slavery; (b) allowing them to marry any Muslim man with their consent if they had no relatives; or (c) at the very least, ordering that if a Muslim man desired a captive woman, he should marry her and not sell her to another man after a temporary sexual relationship.</span><b><strong> </strong></b><span>While the Bible allowed men to marry captive women without their consent, it still required marriage and prohibited selling them after any sexual relations. However, in Islam, Muslim men were permitted to rape captive women without their consent and could then sell them to other men, who would again rape them in temporary sexual relationships without consent and sell them further after losing interest. This allowance for repetitive sexual relations and the repeated sale of enslaved women was made permissible under Islamic law.

</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>Allah/Muhammad could have at least abolished the rape of the virgin and small girls on the first night. If the Jews and the Christians (who were the neighbours of Muhammad) were following the rule of the Bible and not raping captive women and girls for the first full month for thousands of years before Muhammad, why then was it impossible for Allah/Muhammad to do the same?

<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>Had Prophet Muhammad wished, then he could have allowed the slave women to take Hijab (when they were not working) and to cover their naked breasts. It has nothing to do with economic conditions but with basic human rights. But Allah/Muhammad went towards the opposite direction. Not only breasts of slave women were kept naked, but they were also beaten with sticks if they ever wished to cover their bodies by wearing a Hijab.

</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>Allah/Muhammad could have accepted the testimony of slaves in the court, and Sahaba would not have revolted against Allah/Muhammad for that, while it has nothing to do with the economic situation. But Allah/Muhammad wanted to dishonour the slave men and women. In fact, Islam/Muhammad didn't even allow the non-Muslims to give testimony against any crime of any free Muslim man in the court. It was also in order to humiliate the non-Muslims. While Allah/Muhammad usurped the right of "witness" from slave women, thus those poor women were not even able to go to the courts and give witness against the rapist who raped them, or against their own owners if they forced them into prostitution. That is why verse 33:59 tells that Sahaba used to sit on the roads and used to sexually molest the slave women. And Allah/Muhammad didn't punish those companions but only differentiated the free women from the slave through the use of the Hijab so that Sahaba didn't then molest the free women.

<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>Allah/Muhammad could have easily spared the old elderly men by not killing them after taking them as prisoners. Did sparing the elderly men would have destroyed the economy of the mighty Islamic Caliphate?  [<a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity#mozTocId419483">More details here</a>]</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>Allah/Muhammad could have easily declared that the life of a slave had equal value as that of his owner. And he could have easily imposed Qisas (or any other kind of physical punishment) in order to discourage the owners to beat or to kill their slaves. Merely giving a recommendation not to slap them was not enough, and there should have been any physical punishment for the owners for beating or killing them. Again, this has nothing to do with the economic situation, but basic human rights. Had Sahaba revolted against Allah/Muhammad if they had declared the blood of slaves equal to their owners?

<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>He could have allowed the slaves to indulge in love, and to marry the woman of their choice.

<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>He could have ordered to end of the institution of “<strong>Slavery by Birth</strong>” (i.e. children of slaves are automatically born as slaves in Islam).

<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>He could have ordered that it was not allowed to separate the babies (after they got two molar teeth at the age of 6 months) from their slave mothers and then sell them in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery. Did the prohibition of such sale of 6-month-old babies really destroy the economy of the mighty Islamic State?

<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>If any slave fled away, then it means he wanted to live as a free man. But Muhammad ordered the slaughter of the slave if he fled. Why? [<a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity#mozTocId934652">More details here</a>]</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>He could have prohibited the “private ownership” of the slaves and could have declared that all the captives/slaves should only be kept in the ownership of the State. For example, the Law of Draco (which was written 1200 years before Islam), declared that only the State had the right to own the slaves (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://realisticapproach.org/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=30" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>He could have at least ended the Bazaars of Slavery, where poor slave women were paraded half-naked, and the buyers were even allowed to touch their private body parts too. If Ashoka the Great of India could have ended the Slave Trade and the Bazaars of Slavery 800 years before Islam, why then Muhammad (or powerful Muslim rulers like Umar Ibn Khattab) were unable to end the slave trade and the Bazaars of Slavery? [<a href="https://sachaai.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity#mozTocId837504">More details here</a>]</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>He could have at least ended the <strong>slave trade</strong> with the <strong>non-Muslim countries</strong>, where the Muslim owners were even able to sell the Muslim/Jews/Christian slave women to the Polytheists, who raped those women, although those slave women believed in God (Reference: <a href="https://www.kalamullah.com/Books/The%20History%20Of%20Tabari/Tabari_Volume_08.pdf">History of Tabari, vol. 8, Page 39 under the incident of Banu Qurayzah</a>). After that Prophet Muhammad handed over the captive (Jewish) women to companion Saad bin Zayd, and sent him to the area of Najd, so that he could sell those captive (Jew) women there (to the polytheists) and buy weapons and horses from that money.</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>Muslim Bazaars of Slavery were notoriously famous throughout the world and became one of the major sources of income for the Muslim community. But such an economic source from slavery is even worse than the economic sources from other crimes like stealing and robbery. </p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p>He could have replaced the institution of slavery with the institution of Serfdom (like the Buddhist Governments of the 13th century did for the sake of humanity, and to give basic human rights to the slaves (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170119151846/http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/Research/GEHN/GEHNPDF/Conf10_ClarenceSmith.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Link</a>). If the normal Buddhist States were able to do it, why then Muhammad or later coming powerful Muslim rulers not able to do it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As the wise people say: “Where there is a will, there is a way”. But Allah/Muhammad was unable to find ways to end slavery, or even to give basic human rights to the slaves, while they didn’t will it. Otherwise, Muhammad and other powerful Muslim rulers got all the full power and economic stability to abolish slavery completely.</p>
<p>In conclusion, even if Muhammad/Allah was not able to abolish slavery completely, still he was in the position of providing the slaves with these basic human rights, thus reducing their sufferings. But Muhammad/Allah failed miserably here.</p>
<p>And in many cases, Muhammad/Allah even <strong>INCREASED</strong> the sufferings of slaves (like raping captive/slave women in Temporary sexual relationships Halal for Mulsim men and then selling them to another master). While Muhammad's neighbours (i.e. the Jews and Christians) were neither allowing the practice of temporary sexual relationships with captive/slave girls, nor they were allowing multiple masters to rape their shared slave girl, nor they were allowing the swapping of slave girls, nor they were allowing the masters to take the wife of their male slaves for their lust. </p>

<h2>Islamists' Excuse: The West abolished slavery only due to the "Industrial Revolution"</h2>
<p>All Islamic apologists (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBK9Krft5aY&amp;t=1s">link</a>) today come up with another excuse that the West abolished slavery only due to the Industrial Revolution, as they didn't need slave labour after the development of steam engine.</p>
<p>However, this claim is not right. There was already a long historical movement present against slavery in the West before any industrial revolution. This movement was solely based upon HUMANITY and had nothing to do with the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>Here is the timeline of Abolishment of Slavery:</p>

			<title>Did the owner need slave girl's CONSENT for sex?</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="western">Sex without any consent with a slave woman by her owner was so obvious in Islamic literature that none of the Islamic scholars even thought it was necessary to indulge in the discussion if the owner needed the consent of slave women before having sex with her or not. </p>
<p class="western">Unfortunately, modern Islamic apologists deem it Halal to deceive people and to tell open lies to defend Islam. They are denying 14 centuries-long history of Islamic slavery, where millions of poor slave girls were raped without any consent. </p>
<p class="western">An Islamic apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> A Muslim judge Abū ‘Abdullāh al-Ḥalīmī (d. 1012 CE) explicitly prohibit even touching female slaves without their consent:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">وإن اشترى جارية فكرهت أن يمسها أو يضاجعها فلا يمسها ولا يضاجعها ولا يطأها إلا بإذنها</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">“If a female slave is purchased and she dislikes to be touched, or slept with, then he may not touch her, lie with her, or have intercourse with her unless she consents.” (Minhāj fī Shu’ab al-Imān 3/267)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western"><strong>Reply:</strong></p>
<p class="western">If you are to read the original book (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://shamela.ws/book/18567/1353" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://shamela.ws/book/18567/1353</a>) in full, this particular line as written by Al Haleemi is a <strong>recommendation</strong>, not an obligation. He was making many recommendations to develop good relations with slaves, and it is one of them. Thus, it has nothing to do with obligation in Sharia. </p>
<p class="western">Hammering the point home even further, in <a href="https://shamela.ws/book/18567/1398">3/312</a>, this Muslim judge Al Haleemi mentions that the master can force his pagan slaves to convert to Islam, with one of the given reasons being that it makes his female slaves permissible for him <sub>[وإنما ذكرت هذه المسألة رواية في الأمة الوثنية. فقد يجوز أن يكون فيها خاصة دون العبد. لأنه لا يمكن سيدها الاستمتاع بها مع وثنيتها، فيجبر بها على الإسلام، ليتمكن من الاستمتاع، كما يجبر الرجل امرأته الذمية على الغسل من الحيض لتهيأ له مباشرتها. والعبد مفارق ذلك للامة، أن توثنه لا يمنع سيده من الاستمتاع به في شيء.]</sub>. Thus, it strains logic to suggest that he can force his slave to convert to Islam for the sake of having sex with her but for some reason cannot have sex with her against her consent.</p>
<p class="western">Compared to this singular recommendation of this Muslim judge Al Haleemi, there are dozens of clear proofs in Ahadith and history and Islamic Jurisprudence, where the companions raped the captive women and even minor girls. </p>
<p class="western">Muhammad allowed his Jihadists to have sex with captive women even when their husbands were alive. That is rape. </p>
<p class="western">Sahih Muslim (<a href="https://www.sunnah.com/muslim/17/41">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">باب جَوَازِ وَطْءِ الْمَسْبِيَّةِ بَعْدَ الاِسْتِبْرَاءِ وَإِنْ كَانَ لَهَا زَوْجٌ انْفَسَخَ نِكَاحُهَا بِالسَّبْي</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="quotation-english">Chapter: It is permissible to have intercourse with a female captive after it is established that she is not pregnant, and if she has a husband, then her marriage is annulled when she is captured</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">عَنْ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ، الْخُدْرِيِّ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَوْمَ حُنَيْنٍ بَعَثَ جَيْشًا إِلَى أَوْطَاسٍ فَلَقُوا عَدُوًّا فَقَاتَلُوهُمْ فَظَهَرُوا عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَصَابُوا لَهُمْ سَبَايَا فَكَأَنَّ نَاسًا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَحَرَّجُوا مِنْ غِشْيَانِهِنَّ مِنْ أَجْلِ أَزْوَاجِهِنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فِي ذَلِكَ ‏{‏ وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ‏}‏ أَىْ فَهُنَّ لَكُمْ حَلاَلٌ إِذَا انْقَضَتْ عِدَّتُهُنَّ ‏.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="quotation-english">Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah her pleased with him) reported that at the Battle of Hanain Allah's Messenger sent an army to Autas and encountered the enemy and fought with them. Having overcome them and taken them captives, the Companions of Allah's Messenger seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women<strong class="western"> because of their husbands being polytheists.</strong> Then Allah, Most High, sent down regarding that:" And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess (iv. 24)"</blockquote>
<p class="western">Moreover, please also read Kecia Ali's response to this lie: <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-middle-east-studies/article/concubinage-and-consent/F8E807073C33F403A91C1ACA0CFA47FD">Concubinage and Consent</a></p>
<p class="western">And Imam Shafi'i wrote in this book <a href="https://shamela.ws/book/1655/1213"><em>Al-Umm</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وله أن يزوج أمته بغير إذنها بكرا كانت أو ثيبا</p>
<p>“He (i.e. the owner) may marry off his female slave without her consent whether she is a virgin or non-virgin.</p>

Translation for those who can't read Arabic (Credit: User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/afiefh/">afiefh</a> from Reddit):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If a right hand possession (female slave) refuses to have sex with her master, is it permissible to compel her by force?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Praise be to Allah, and may prayers and peace be upon the Messenger of God and his family and companions. It is better for a Muslim to occupy himself with what concerns him of the rulings of his religion, and to invest his time and energy in seeking knowledge that will benefit him. The meaning of knowledge is action. Knowledge that does not facilitate action, it is not good to search for. Among that are issues related to the ownership what the right hand possess (slaves); There is no use for it in this era.</p>
<p>With regard to the question: If the wife is not permitted to refrain from intimate relations with her husband except with a valid excuse, then it is more so not permissible for the right hand possession to refrain from intimate relations with her master except with a valid excuse; he has more right to sex with her through possessing her than the man having intercourse with his wife through the marriage contract; Because the ownership of the right hand possession is complete ownership, so he owns all her benefits, while marriage contracts only grant him only the ownership intended through the marriage contract so it is a restricted form of ownership.</p>
<p><strong>If the wife or the right hand possession refuses to have sex without a legitimate excuse, then the husband or the master may force her to do so.</strong> However, he should take into account her psychological state, and treat her kindly. Kindness in all matters is desirable, as the prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: “Kindness is not found in anything but that it beautifies it, and it is not removed from anything except that it disgraces it.” (Narrated by Muslim).</p>
<p>Allah knows best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also see this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ijtihadnet.com/wp-content/uploads/Minor-Marriage-in-Early-Islamic-Law.pdf">C. Baugh “Minor Marriage in Early Islamic Law” p 10, footnote 45.</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="http://ijtihadnet.com/wp-content/uploads/Minor-Marriage-in-Early-Islamic-Law.pdf">45</a>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Almost invariably, as jurists consider the legal parameters of sex with prepubescents, (“at what point is the minor female able to tolerate the sexual act upon her”/matā tuṣliḥ lilwaṭʾ) the word used when describing sexual relations with a prepubescent female is waṭʾ. This is a word that I have chosen to translate as “to perform the sexual act upon her.” This translation, although unwieldy, seems to convey the lack of mutuality in the sexual act that this word suggests (unlike, for example, the word jimāʿ ). It is worth noting that the semantic range of the word includes “to tread/step on;” indeed this is given as the primary meaning of the word. See Ibn Manẓūr, Lisān al-‘Arab (Beirut: Dār Ṣādir, 1955), 2:195–197.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And also see this: </span></p>

<p>“Even among medieval Jewish and Christian communities, for whom slavery was uncontroversial, the Muslim practice of slave-concubinage was outrageous” and on p380 “But it was a greatly diminished autonomy. In the Shariah, <strong>consent was crucial if you belonged to a class of individuals whose consent mattered: free women and men who were adults</strong> (even male slaves could not be married off against their will according to the Hanbali and Shafi ʿ i schools, and this extended to slaves with mukataba arrangements in the Hanafi school). 47 <strong>Consent did not matter for minors. And it did not matter for female slaves,</strong> who sexual relationship with them if he wanted (provided the woman was not married or under a contract to buy her own freedom)”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span id="Quote_from_al-Shafi'i" class="mw-headline">Misquoting al-Shafi'i to prove CONSENT:</span></h3>
<p><span class="mw-headline">Islamic apologists present the following excuse (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021758/https://www.call-to-monotheism.com/does_islam_permit_muslim_men_to_rape_their_slave_girls_">link</a>):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Imam Al Shaafi'i said:</p>
<p>وإذا اغتصب الرجل الجارية ثم وطئها بعد الغصب وهو من غير أهل الجهالة أخذت منه الجارية والعقر وأقيم عليه حد الزنا</p>
<p>"If a man acquires by force a slave-girl, then has sexual intercourse with her after <strong>he acquires her by force</strong>, and if he is not excused by ignorance, then the slave-girl will be taken from him, he is required to pay the fine, and he will receive the punishment for illegal sexual intercourse." (Imam Al Shaafi'i, Kitaabul Umm, Volume 3, page 253)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a clear deception while Shafi'i is not talking about the owner having sex with his own slave girl, but it is about kidnapping and then raping the <strong>slave girl of another person</strong>. </p>
<h3>Misquoting Imam Malik to prove CONSENT:</h3>
<p>The dishonesty of Islamic apologists continues. They use the following tradition by Imam Malik to prove an owner needs consent from his female slave before having sex with her <span class="mw-headline">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021758/https://www.call-to-monotheism.com/does_islam_permit_muslim_men_to_rape_their_slave_girls_">link</a>):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Imam Maalik said: </p>
<p>الأمر عندنا في الرجل يغتصب المرأة بكراً كانت أو ثيبا : أنها إن كانت حرة : فعليه صداق مثلها , وإن كانت أمَة : فعليه ما نقص من ثمنها ، والعقوبة في ذلك على المغتصب ، ولا عقوبة على المغتصبة في ذلك كله</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In our view the man who rapes a woman, regardless of whether she is a virgin or not, if she is a free woman he must pay a "dowry" like that of her peers, <u>and if she is a slave</u> he must pay whatever has been detracted from her value. The punishment is to be carried out on the rapist and there is no punishment for the woman who has been raped, whatever the case.  (Imam Maalik, <em>Al-Muwatta'</em>, Volume 2, page 734)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, just like in the case of Shafi'i above, here Malik is not talking about an owner raping his OWN slave woman, but he is only talking about raping the slave woman of <strong>another person</strong>. </p>
<h3>Misquoting the tradition of Dharar to prove CONSENT:</h3>
<p>Islamic apologists also use the following tradition to prove that an owner needs the consent of his slave girl before having sex with her <span class="mw-headline">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021758/https://www.call-to-monotheism.com/does_islam_permit_muslim_men_to_rape_their_slave_girls_">link</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sunan Al Bayhaqi, Volume 2, page 363, Hadith no. 18685:  </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Abu al-Hussain bin al-Fadhl al-Qatan narrated from Abdullah bin Jaffar bin Darestweh from Yaqub bin Sufyan from al-Hassab bin Rabee from Abdullah bin al-Mubarak from Kahmas from Harun bin Al-Asam who said: Umar bin al-Khatab may Allah be pleased with him sent Khalid bin al-Walid in an army, hence Khalid sent Dharar bin al-Auwzwar in a squadron and they invaded a district belonging to the tribe of Bani Asad. <strong><u>They then captured a pretty bride</u></strong>, Dharar liked her hence he asked his companions to grant her to him and they did so. <strong><u>He then had sexual intercourse with her</u></strong>, when he completed his mission he felt guilty, and went to Khalid and told him about what he did. Khalid said: 'I permit you and made it lawful to you.' He said: 'No not until you write a message to Umar'. (Then they sent a message to Umar) <strong><u>and Umar answered that he (Dharar) should be stoned.</u></strong> By the time Umar's message was delivered, Dharar was dead. (Khalid) said: 'Allah didn't want to disgrace Dharar'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it is clear that he was punished by Umar because he raped that slave girl before becoming his owner (i.e. before the distribution of war booty). </p>
<p>This is the same if you have sex with a free woman but do Nikah afterwards (i.e. you are not a husband and wife at the time of sex). Due to it, even if you marry later, still you will be punished for fornication. </p>
<p>In simple words, this tradition has nothing to do with an owner having sex with his own slave woman without her consent. </p>
<h3>Misquoting al-Shafi'i agin to prove CONSENT:</h3>
<p>Islamic apologists also misquote al-Shafi'i again to prove an owner needs consent from his slave woman before having sex with her <span class="mw-headline">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021758/https://www.call-to-monotheism.com/does_islam_permit_muslim_men_to_rape_their_slave_girls_">link</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَهَكَذَا لَوْ كَانَتْ مُنْفَرِدَةً بِهِ أَوْ مَعَ أَمَةٍ لَهُ يَطَؤُهَا أُمِرَ بِتَقْوَى اللَّهِ تَعَالَى وَأَنْ لَا يضربهَا فِي الْجِمَاعِ وَلَمْ يُفْرَضْ عَلَيْهِمِنْهُ شَيْءٌ بِعَيْنِهِ إنَّمَا يُفْرَضُ عَلَيْهِ مَا لَا صَلَاحَ لَهَا إلَّا بِهِ مِنْ نَفَقَةٍ وَسُكْنَى وَكِسْوَةٍ وَأَنْ يَأْوِيَ إلَيْهَا فَأَمَّا الْجِمَاعُ فَمَوْضِعُ تَلَذُّذٍ وَلَا يُجْبَرُ أَحَدٌ عَلَيْهِ</p>
<p>He said: And so if she is alone with him [i.e., he has no other wives], or with a slavegirl he has that he has sex with, he is ordered [to fulfill his obligations] in reverence to God the Exalted, and not to do her harm with regard to intercourse, and he is not obligated to any specific amount of it (wa lam yufraḍ ʿalayhi minhu shayʾbi ʿaynihi). Rather, he is only [obligated] to provide what she absolutely cannot do without, maintenance and lodging and clothing, and also to visit her (yaʾwī). <strong>However, intercourse is a matter of pleasure and no one is compelled to it</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, al-Shafi'i is talking about <strong>MEN</strong> only i.e. intercourse is a matter of pleasure for MEN and they cannot be compelled to it. </p>
<p>As far as the consent of a slave girl is concerned, then Imam Shafi'i is clear it does not mean anything to her owner. </p>
<p class="western">And Imam Shafi'i wrote in this book <a href="https://shamela.ws/book/1655/1213"><em>Al-Umm</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وله أن يزوج أمته بغير إذنها بكرا كانت أو ثيبا</p>
<p>“He (i.e. the owner) may marry off his female slave without her consent whether she is a virgin or non-virgin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrary to slave women, the consent of a male slave is needed according to Ahmad bin Hanbal, while Abu Hanifi and Malik say that an owner can coerce male slaves into marriage without their consent. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_Islamic_Jurisprudence">Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence</a> (also known as al-Mawsu'ah al-fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiya الموسوعة الفقهیة) writes (<a href="https://shamela.ws/book/11430/13779#p1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>لَيْسَ لِلسَّيِّدِ أَنْ يُزَوِّجَ عَبْدَهُ الذَّكَرَ الْبَالِغَ امْرَأَةً لاَ يَرْضَاهَا حُرَّةً كَانَتْ أَوْ أَمَةً، فَإِنْ كَانَ الْعَبْدُ صَغِيرًا جَازَ، وَهَذَا مَذْهَبُ أَحْمَدَ وَقَوْلٌ لِلشَّافِعِيِّ، وَقَال أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ، وَمَالِكٌ: لِلسَّيِّدِ أَنْ يُجْبِرَ عَبْدَهُ عَلَى النِّكَاحِ</p>
<p>A master cannot marry his adult male slave to a woman whom the slave dislikes, whether she is free or a slave. However, if the slave is a minor, it is permissible. This is the view of Ahmad, one opinion within the Shafi'i school. According to  Abu Hanifa and Malik, a master can coerce his slave into marriage.</p>

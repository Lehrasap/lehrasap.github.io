        <p>Islamic preachers claim many miracles about Zamzam water. Let us see if they are real miracles or only deceptions by Islamic preachers. </p>
<p>First of all, Zakir Naik claims (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zakirnaikofficial/photos/a.150461375036187/528099710605683/?__tn__=%2CO*F">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">... So they pumped 690 Millions liters of Zam Zam in 24 hours, but it was re-supplied in 11 minutes only. There are 2 miracles here, the first that Zam Zam was re-filled immediately, &amp; the second is that Allah Holds the extra-ordinarily powerful Aquifer for not throwing extra Zam Zam out of the well, otherwise the world will SINK.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The water in Zamzam’s well in Mecca is not depleted because it is an aquifer, and its reservoir is connected to renewable groundwater (which ultimately replenishes from rainwater in the valley and the surrounding hills).</p>
<p>The city of Mecca is located in a valley, which is surrounded by hills. And Masjid-ul-Haram (and the well of Zamzam) is the LOWEST point in this valley. The well of Zamzam is about 40 to 50 feet deep from the level of water in the surrounding hills. This causes the water of the whole valley and the surrounding hilly areas to move towards the Zamzam reservoir (<a href="https://ur.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%B2%D9%85">link)</a>. </p>
<p>There are hundreds of such aquifers present in the world, with a huge amount of water. Some of them have so much water that it comes out as streams and springs. Although Zamzam also has a lot of water, it cannot be compared in size and volume to many of those other aquifers, while no water streams or springs flow from it, but it is only a "Well". And Saudi Government has to put in huge pumps in order to take water out of it. And Saudi government also has to regulate its consumption. </p>
<p>Thus, although Zamzam is ONLY a well (and does not even have enough water for springs and streams), still Zakir Naik claims that Allah has stopped Zamzam to overflow, otherwise it will sink the entire world while it has an indefinite amount of water. And the most unfortunate thing is that Muslim preachers like Zakir Naik are still able to deceive millions of innocent people, by fooling them with such lies. </p>
<p>Please think about it, if Zamzam really had an indefinite amount of water, then the whole of Mecca would be full of greenery, and Saudi Government would have used it for establishing green farmlands and cultivation around Mecca. </p>
<h2>Muhammad's fantasy stories about the sweet water of the Nile and the Euphrates </h2>
<p>Muslim preachers, like Zakir Naik, are only making such stories on their own while they know that their followers are ignorant, and will not catch their false stories. </p>
<p>And the same was the case with Muhammad too. Please read the following Ahadith. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3207">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3207</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said: .... (On the night of ascension, where he went to heavens) Then I was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, <em><strong>and four rivers originated at its root</strong></em>, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, 'The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the <em><strong>Nile and the Euphrates</strong></em>.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2839">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2839:</a></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: <em><strong>Saihan, Jaihan</strong></em>, <em><strong>Euphrates and Nile</strong></em> are all among the rivers of Paradise.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The people of that era didn't know about the sources of water in rivers. Thus, Muhammad made up fantasy stories that sweet water in these two rivers comes directly from the heavens. And unfortunately, billions of Muslims become fools and believe in such fantasy stories of Muhammad, instead of challenging him. </p>
<p>Now, these Ahadith became a headache for Islamic apologists, as they fit in none of the cosmological models. They are unable to answer how water, which is coming out of the root of a Tin the paradise, lands on the earth.</p>
<p>But this issue was also solved when we find the same story in the bible too (nevertheless, a little different concept).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:10-2:14">Genesis 2:10-14</a>: <span id="en-NIV-41" class="text Gen-2-10">A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into <em><strong>four</strong></em> headwaters.</span><span id="en-NIV-42" class="text Gen-2-11"><sup class="versenum"> </sup>The name of the first is the <strong>Pishon </strong>۔۔۔</span><span id="en-NIV-44" class="text Gen-2-13">The name of the second river is the <em><strong>Gihon</strong></em>; it winds through the entire land of Cush. </span><span id="en-NIV-45" class="text Gen-2-14">The name of the third river is the <strong>Tigris</strong>; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the <strong>Euphrates</strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference between the story of the Bible, and the story of Muhammad is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The '<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden"><em><strong>Garden of Eden</strong></em></a>' (The paradise, where God kept Adam and Eve and the forbidden tree) <em><strong>was present <span style="color: #ff0000;">on the earth</span></strong></em> in the story of the bible. Thus, it was not a problem when the bible claimed that the water of Tigris and Ecomesates come from the 'Garden of Eden'.</li>
<li>But Muhammad made a mistake while copying the story of the bible, and he claimed that Adam and Eve and the forbidden tree <em><strong>were NOT present on the earth, but in paradise <span style="color: #ff0000;">in the heavens</span></strong></em>. Thus, it became a problem to explain how the water from the root of a tree in heaven, lands in the rivers on the earth. </li>
</ul>
<p>Muhammad was copying the stories of the bible, but he was still very much illiterate and not a scholar. Thus, he made a lot of <em><strong>human mistakes</strong></em> while copying those older stories. </p>

</blockquote>
<h2>Muslim Preachers: Zamzam was discovered 2600 years before Muhammad by Hajar and Ismael</h2>
<p>This story is also false. </p>
<p>Actually, the whole story of Ibrahim and Hajar and Ismael coming to Mecca is false and only an invention of Muhammad himself. Muhammad invented this story, in order to get importance among Jews and Christians for being a descendant of Ibrahim. </p>
<p>The Quraysh (and all other Arabs) had no idea that they were from the progeny of Ismael/Ibrahim, and Kaba has anything to do with Ibrahim, or Zamzam was discovered by Hajar, etc. Muhammad was the first one who invented all those stories and told them to Quraysh/Arabs. </p>
<p>You can read all these facts on this website: <a href="https://historyofmecca.com/">https://historyofmecca.com/</a></p>
<p>It is a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Very, Very</strong><strong> Important </strong></span>issue, and those who want to search for the truth, have to read all the facts on the above-mentioned website. It exposes completely all these false stories by Muhammad. <span style="color: #0f00ff;"><strong>Please,</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #0f00ff;">don't miss reading articles on this website (unfortunately, many of us are totally unaware of these important facts)</span></strong>. </p>
<p>The Quraysh knew very well that the well of Zamzam was discovered only 40 years before the birth of Muhammad, by his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib. Even Islamic traditions also recorded it. Nevertheless, Muslim preachers came up with another fantasy story that Zamzam was actually discovered by Hajar, but then one tribe closed it and made it hidden from others. And it stayed hidden for centuries (or thousands of years) till Abdul Mutalib again discovered it. </p>
<p>But how is it possible?</p>
<p>According to stories by Muhammad, initially, all Arabs were monotheists, and they were visiting Kaba for Hajj every year, and they were drinking water from Zamzam for centuries. How can then a tribe close and hide it, when thousands of Arabs knew exactly where it was situated (near Kaba) and drank water from it every year?</p>
<p>Naturally, Islamic preachers have no answer to this. </p>
<h2>Zamzam was full of SNAKES till Muhammad ordered to kill them</h2>
<p>Today, Muslim preachers deceive people by telling them miracles of Zamzam water like it has supernatural healing effects and (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200801183358/https://www.arabnews.com/node/1712901/saudi-arabia">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The well’s ever-clean water has no moss, insects, fungus, or any other impurities. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the truth is, there are poisonous elements present in Zamzam water (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-13267205">BBC Report)</a>. Please also read a detailed report on <a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Drinking_Zamzam_Water_and_its_Health_Risks">WikiIslam about Zamzam water</a>. </p>
<p>Moreover, Zamzam was full of snakes until Muhammad ordered their killing. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5251">Sunan Abi Dawud, 5251</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Al-Abbas said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): We wish to sweep out Zamzam, but in it there are some of these Jinnan, meaning small snakes; so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered that they should be killed.</p>
<p>Grade: <strong>Sahih</strong> (Albani)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muslim preachers also don't tell why there were snakes in Zamzam. </p>
<p>While Pagans of Mecca also consider snakes to be one of their gods (just like Hindus consider snakes to be gods and worship them). Imam Tabari wrote that pagans of Mecca used to worship snakes in Zamzam, and used to give presents to them. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230307184726/http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/the-small-hajj-called-umra">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was also a serpent in the Kaabah, which lived in the well of the temple where the worshippers threw their gifts.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/the-small-hajj-called-umra#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[<em>Tarikh al-Tabari</em>, I, page 525</a>]  The serpents were considered by the Arabians to be Jinn and devils.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/the-small-hajj-called-umra#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[<em>Taj Al Aruss</em>, I, pages 147 and 284</a>] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abdul Muttalib, who discovered the well of Zamzam, was himself an idol-worshipper, and he tried to sacrifice his son Abdullah (the father of Muhammad) for the sake of his idol gods. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008022324/http://www.brotherpete.com/index.php?topic=1784.msg7346">Link</a>). </p>
<h2>Why Don't Islamic Preachers Confirm the Healing Miracles of Zamzam Through Scientific Studies?</h2>
<p>Muhammad claimed many health benefits from Zamzam water. For instance, he claimed that drinking only Zamzam water for 30 days would cause weight gain.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2473a">Sahih Muslim, 2473a</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Dharr, who had stayed near the Ka’bah and its coverings for forty days and nights with no food or drink other than (Zamzam): “How long have you been here?” Abu Dharr said: “I have been here for <strong>thirty days and nights</strong>.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Who has been feeding you?” <strong>He said, “I have had nothing but <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1698">Zamzam water</a>, and I have gotten so fat that I have folds of fat on my stomach</strong>. I do not feel any of the tiredness or weakness of hunger and I have not become thin.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily, it is blessed, it is food that nourishes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, Islamic preachers repeat Muhammad's claims and attribute various health benefits to Zamzam water. However, they fail to back up their assertions with scientific evidence. They do not conduct scientific studies to verify Muhammad's claims about Zamzam's ability to cure diseases and alleviate hunger.</p>
<p>But why? Why do Islamic preachers refrain from proving their prophet's statements through scientific research? Is it because they fear that scientific studies might disprove their prophet's claims instead of validating them? If these studies were to confirm Zamzam's therapeutic properties, everyone would embrace Islam. On the other hand, if no such effects are found, Islamic preachers must cease spreading false tales and leave Islam altogether.</p>
<p>Think about it - if Zamzam truly possessed healing qualities against sickness and starvation, wouldn't Saudi Arabian hospitals be unnecessary?</p>
<p>&gt;And the truth is, there are poisonous elements present in Zamzam water (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-13267205">BBC Report)</a>.

<p>Every night, while the sun is prostrating under the Throne of god (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/1/306">https://sunnah.com/muslim/1/306</a>) and Devils are peeing in the ears of sleeping people (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/19/25">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/19/25</a>) and staying in their noses (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/104">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/104</a>) the Almighty descends to the lowest heaven, and says: Who supplicates Me so that I may answer him? Who asks Me so that I may give to him? Who asks Me forgiveness so that I may forgive him? (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/6/201">https://sunnah.com/muslim/6/201</a>) When he finishes collecting the prayers of people, he receives tons of questions from the Angels of the Uterus, they're thousands each one of them follow the developpement of babys in every womb and they say 'O Lord, semen! O Lord,it is now a clot! O Lord, it is now a piece of flesh.' And then, if Allah wishes to complete its creation, the angel asks, 'O Lord, will it be a male or a female? A wretched or a blessed doer of good? How much will his provisions be? What will his age be?' So all that is written while the creature is still in the mother's womb." (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/82/2">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/82/2</a>) In the meantime, some new Jihadis blew themselves and got up to heaven, so Allah the Almighty goes back to the seventh hevean and goes to visit them, He finds them in the bodies of green birds who have their nests in chandeliers hung from the throne. They eat the fruits of Paradise from wherever they like and then nestle in these chandeliers. Then he asks them : Do ye want anything? They say: What more shall we desire? We eat the fruit of Paradise from wherever we like. Their Lord ask them the same question thrice. When they see that they will continue to be asked and not left, they say: O Lord, we wish that Thou mayest return our souls to our bodies so that we may be slain in Thy way once again ((<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/33/181">https://sunnah.com/muslim/33/181</a>). When He sees that they don't need anything, he leaves them and Go to Issue Orders to The Angels, so they start beating with their wings in obedience to His Statement which sounds like that of a chain dragged over a rock. (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/107">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/107</a>) Until the Orders reaches the Angels of the Cloud, and they speak between them about those orders but devils who spy on them hear words of what they say and pour it in the ears of a soothsayer as one pours something in a bottle, and they add one hundred lies to that (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/97">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/97</a>) But sometimes A flame may overtake and burn the spy devil before conveying the news to the one below him (<a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/43780">https://sunnah.com/urn/43780</a>) In the meantime, two groups of angels follow every person on earth, a team in the morning and a team at night, they shift places and when every team finishes the job, they get back to the seventh heaven to their Lord, and he asks them "In what state did you leave My slaves?' The angels reply, 'When we left them, they were praying, and when we reached them they were praying.' " (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/56">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/56</a>) And there's a Third team of Angels writing down the list of people who attend the prayer at Mosque, On every Friday they take their stand at every gate of the mosque to write the names of the people chronologically and when the Imam sits on the pulpit they fold up their scrolls and get ready to listen to the sermon." (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/22">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/22</a>) But at that time, devils are fleeing while farting, because they cant support the Adhan, they flee five times a day at every prayer. (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/4/19">https://sunnah.com/muslim/4/19</a>) They only stop fleeing in Ramadan, because they are chained and the gates of heaven are open and the gates of hell closed (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/30/9">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/30/9</a>).

			<title>My Last Words to Allah</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/miscellaneous-articles/23-my-last-words-to-allah</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/miscellaneous-articles/23-my-last-words-to-allah</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Pascal's Wager</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Before Islam, this exact argument was also used in the Christian world during the 17th century. Christians used this reasoning to prevent people from abandoning Christianity: "Keep faith in Christianity so that if the Christian God turns out to be real after death, you'll be saved. If He doesn't, there's no harm done."</li>
<li>This concept is known as <em>Pascal's Wager</em>. The idea is that one should "wager" their life on the existence of the Christian God, so that if they face Him after death, they can avoid eternal punishment.</li>
<li>However, Western intellectuals completely rejected Pascal's Wager. The wager only considers the possibility of the Christian God being real, but it doesn't address what happens if, after death, it turns out that the Muslim, Hindu, or any other religion's God is real.</li>
<li>Therefore, if you're an atheist, you might face a "single punishment." But if you worship a false god instead of the true one, you risk facing "double punishment" because you'd be guilty of vehemently opposing the true God.</li>
<li>A more logical approach than Pascal's Wager might be to identify as an <em>agnostic</em> rather than believing in the Christian God. Agnostics don't affirm the existence of any religious gods but acknowledge the possibility that a divine force may or may not exist. This position might offer the best chance of avoiding punishment after death.</li>
<li>Gambling with your beliefs is inherently flawed. One should make decisions with sincerity, guided by reason and evidence, to determine what is right and wrong. Is there really a God as described by Muslims, or is this a story fabricated by Muhammad? Could a divine being truly issue commands that clash with basic human values? Could a divine God endorse the continuation of slavery? Would a divine God mandate the death penalty for apostasy? Were Muhammad's attacks on peaceful non-Muslim tribes just? Was it truly divine justice to force them to either accept Islam or face death? (Note: Only the People of the Book were allowed to pay jizya; non-believers had to either convert or face death.)</li>
<li>If a divine God exists, then human reason suggests that His justice should align with human intentions. For example, if someone rejects Islam after sincere reflection, then instead of punishment for apostasy, divine justice should reward their intention.</li>
<li><strong>Human well-being should never depend on a gamble. If any God has created a system where well-being hinges on gambling, then both the system and the God are flawed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>An ALTERNATIVE Approach to Refute Pascal's Wager</strong></h2>
<p>[I am an ex-Muslim. When I began to have doubts about Islam and was in the process of leaving it, I had never encountered the concept of 'atheism' and had no interaction with other atheists. In fact, even today, it's likely that about half of the Muslim population in Islamic countries still has no understanding of what 'atheism' is. So, when Islamic preachers posed Pascal's Wager to me, I had to find my own way to counter it. I ultimately developed the following alternative approach to overcome it.]</p>
<p>Even after truly learning that Islam is nothing more than human revelations, I couldn't take the FINAL step of leaving it and had to remain attached to Islam for a while longer.</p>
<p>Especially, the last question was: "<strong>What if Allah reveals Himself after my death</strong>?" (It is another form of the same question of Pascal Wager)</p>
<p>I contemplated this question from every perspective before directing my last words to Allah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh Allah! If indeed You exist and You are aware of the depths of my heart, then You would see that I have earnestly sought the truth.</p>
<p>However, my sincere search has convincingly led me to the belief within my heart that You do not exist. It is my inherent sense of humanity that leads me to conclude that your system (Islam) is built upon hostility towards humanity.</p>
<p>Do You truly desire for me to become a hypocrite? Should I outwardly acknowledge Your existence despite the internal denial in my heart and mind?</p>
<p>And if I refuse to be a hypocrite, will You condemn me to eternal damnation, even though my heart is true? Will all the good deeds I have done for the betterment of humanity go to waste, leading me to eternal torment?</p>
<p>Therefore, if I am to be held accountable for my disbelief in You, then 'first,' You must answer for Your failure to provide sufficient evidence of Your existence. You must explain why I couldn't recognize You despite my genuine search for You. Why do you condemn billions of people, born into non-Muslim families by Your design, to burn in eternal hellfire simply because they did not become Muslims?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba372a;">If You reject my sincere intentions, then either Your promise of 'Verily, the reward of deeds depends on the intentions' is false, or Your promise of eternal hellfire is false.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were my last words to Allah. I never addressed Him thereafter.</p>
<p>These words served as a "powerful argument" for me, and they encouraged me to finally take that last step of leaving Islam.</p>

			<title>Is Childbirth in Minor Girls safer than 29-year-old Girls?</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Danial tweeted (<a href="https://twitter.com/Haqiqatjou/status/1661029117481873411">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a top medical journal, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>minor</strong></span> marriage and childbirth is very safe throughout the world, far safer than marriage and childbirth after age 29. Existing data indicates that marriage and childbirth at early ages <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2800ff;"><strong>(e.g., 15-19)</strong></span> is extremely safe. The data suggest that if we want to name and shame cultures for endangering women, we should stigmatize those (liberal) cultures which encourage marriage and childbirth after ages 20-25 - as danger to women rapidly increases after this age. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/daniel_minor.jpg" alt="Danial: 15 to 20 years old MINOR girls" width="473" height="522" loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/daniel_minor.jpg"></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Answer: It is not about being a "minor", but about the "age of consent"</h2>
<p>Dear People, </p>
<p>Please understand that the religion of Islam works as a cult, where its followers are very easily manipulated and deceived by Islamic preachers like Daniel. </p>
<p>Daniel is very clearly deceiving them by calling 15 to 20 years old girls "<strong>minors</strong>" in this matter. </p>
<p>The term of "minor" in the world is used for LEGAL issues (like drinking, driving licence, crimes etc.). And it is 18 years. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Nevertheless, the issue is about the "marriage", and it is not about being a minor, but it is about the "<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">age of consent</strong>".</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">And this "age of consent" in Europe and almost all over the world is 16 years</strong> (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/ages-of-consent-around-world-countries-laws-japan-sexual-abuse-b1061907.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">link</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his Muslim followers are not in a position to figure out this deception, while religion makes people often blind. This is the main reason why religions are so successful in brainwashing their followers.</p>
<p>Islam allows men to marry minor girls, and penetration in their vaginas starts at the age of 8 or 9 years or even earlier if they think that the prepubescent girl is strong enough to bear the pain of penetration. Nevertheless, men (neither the father of the girl nor the husband nor any medical doctor) are in a position to find out if an 8 or 9 or 10  years old girl is ready for penetration. This results often in the painful suffering of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula#:~:text=A%20vaginal%20fistula%20is%20an,and%20other%20irritative%20type%20symptoms."><strong>Viginal Fistula</strong></a> among girls (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/">link</a>). </p>
<p>A vaginal fistula is an abnormal opening between the vagina and other nearby organs in the pelvis, including the bladder or rectum. A fistula can cause many complications, such as urinary and fecal leakage, abnormal vaginal discharge, tissue damage, kidney infections and other irritative type symptoms.</p>
<p>In his promotion of minor marriage, Daniel promotes impregnating 9 or 10 year olds to "extend the fertility window", through the practice of marriage to an old man marrying, or having sex with 9 years old prepubescent girls. He calls it to be a tradition (Reference: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;t=2753s">Youtube Video of Daniel Haqiqatjou</a>)</p>
<p>Therefore, if Daniel really wants to defend the Sharia Ruling of having sex with minor girls, then he should bring a scientific study which deals with girls from 9 years and onwards. </p>
<p>Secondly, this study of 15 to 19 years old girls (which Daniel mentioned) is also not showing accurate results. We know that in almost all countries of the world, marriage is legal only after 18 years. Thus, most of the girls in this group of 15-19 years are actually getting married at the age of 18 or 19 years, while some of them may be between 16 to 17 years too, but there are only a few who marry at the age of 15 and get babies.</p>
<p>Childbirth is still dangerous at the age of 15 years, as it becomes clear from other studies. For example, look at the following study: </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x</a> </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">". ......girls aged <span style="color: #2800ff;">15 or under</span> had an odds ratio for maternal death <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>four times higher</strong></span> than women aged 20–24. "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the Vaginal Fistula, please read this study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12]."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, the high mortality rate among children from teen mothers is not the only problem, but they suffer from other horrific health problems too, the whole of their lives.</p>

<p>Is all this Data Islamophobic?</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Women in the Western world don't hesitate to get children after the age of 29, while medical facilities have made childbirth safer even after 29 years. It is reflected in the chart itself, that Daniel presented.

<p>And then this same verse has been repeated multiple times in the Quran (Verses <a href="https://quranx.com/53.22">53:22</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/53.32">53:32</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/53.40">53:40</a>)</p>
<p>And then the Quran claims that its verses are CLEAR.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.1">27:1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> تِلْكَ آيَاتُ الْقُرْآنِ وَكِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ <br>These are the verse of the Koran and a Clear/Manifest Book. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the Quran claims that it was revealed in Arabic language, so then people can understand it. </p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.2">12:2</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ<br>We have revealed it in the Arabic language so that you  would understand it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">So, what is the benefit of revealing it in the Arabic language, when 20% is still ambiguous for Arabic speakers? </p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, as soon as Muslims will claim that 20% of the Quran is ambiguous, then the Quran will automatically become a liar. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, Zakir Naik's claim that 80% of the Quran matches 100% of science, is also wrong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was nothing scientific in the Quran, which was not known by the people of that time. Ancient Roman and Greek scientists told many things about science before Islam. And that scientific stories also reached Syria and other Arab areas through traders. </p>
<p dir="ltr">And Muhammad only copied those old scientific stories in the Quran. Therefore, there is not a single scientific miracle present in the Quran which was not known to the people of that time. </p>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, there were many things in those scientific stories, which were wrong. And Muhammad also copied those wrong scientific things in the Quran too. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Muslim apologists come up with an excuse that Muhammad was illiterate, and thus he was not able to read and copy those scientific stories. But this excuse has no weight, while Muhammad was not <strong>DEAF.</strong> He was indeed able to HEAR those scientific stories, and then tell them to others to write them down in the Quran. Arab people of that era had extraordinary memory, and they were able to memorize large poems word by word, although most of them were totally illiterate. </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An excuse by Muslim apologist:</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">A Muslim apologist came up with this excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Ex-Muslims are taking wrong meaning out of that 20% claim. It only meant that modern science is still limited, and thus it is not able to understand the rest 20% of science that is present in the Quran.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">And we tell them that it is not the case. Science has already reached to that level where it completely refutes all the so-called Quranic miracles. </p>
<p dir="ltr">For example:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The Quran claims that humans are born from gushing <em>water</em> (i.e. sperm), which comes from between the <em>backbone</em> and the ribs. </li>
<li dir="ltr">But science is already in a position to completely refute this Quranic claim. </li>
<li dir="ltr">And it tells that the gushing water (i.e. the sperms) doesn't come out between the backbone and the ribs, but they are produced and come out of the testicles (<a href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Semen_Production_in_the_Quran">link</a>). </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, modern Islam apologists don't claim that modern science is wrong about testicles. But they come up with excuses that the Quranic verse didn't mean that, but it meant that and that and that (i.e. several meanings). </p>
<p>But when they come up with several new (and again mutually contradictory) meanings of the Quranic verse, then it proves only that the verses of the Quran are neither clear nor easy to understand. </p>

<h2 class="western" style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">Internal difference of opinion among atheists regarding systems (political, economy, laws etc.):</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">One atheist opinion is:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Atheism is simply the lack of belief in a God or Gods. It has no system/systems of its own regarding politics, economy, laws etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Nevertheless, another opinion differs from it.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In the real world, LIFE is not LIMITED to only to the definitions, but life goes further for both a religious person and an atheist person. They have to use their mind for THINKING in order to solve the practical challenges of this life and to introduce systems in the arena of politics, economy, laws etc.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Another argument is given below:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There is no inherent ideology, dogma, or political stance that goes along with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Nevertheless, in the real world, the opposite is true. All atheists are compelled one way or another to THINK about this fact as to which political system is the best for humanity and for them. In a practical world, it is impossible to avoid it.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And history is a witness that irreligious freethinkers (which also include atheists) came up with many different systems.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For example, Buddha gave his own system of life as a free thinker. He was not following any religious teachings/system. He pondered upon life a lot, and then he developed his own teachings as a freethinker. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Communism/Socialism were also the results of that same non-religious freethinking by those people who didn't follow religion (including atheists).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Democracy/Secularism/Capitalism etc. are also the result of the freethinking of people who didn't want to follow Religious Systems. Even religious people also joined the ranks of irreligious people when it came to State systems, while they limited their religion to their personal life only. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Of course, all these systems (which came into being due to the freethinking of non-religious people) were not completely free of MISTAKES, as it is a part of Human Nature that humans are not perfect (contrary to them Religions claim that their gods are 100% perfect).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Are these systems, which were made by freethinkers, totally free of mistakes? No, they are not. <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">But they have the ability to reform themselves due to the ability to do freethinking</strong>.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">All non-religious systems are "<strong>evolving</strong>" with time and being reformed. While religions have limitations to this "reforming" process and it is slow, and it is mostly about secondary issues. And in the case of Islam, this reformation is almost non-existent.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is a personal opinion that many atheists are making a mistake by limiting themselves only to the definition of atheism and denying its role in the development of society by giving it different non-religious systems. These atheists seem to be afraid that then religious elements will start attacking them due to the shortcomings of these systems.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Nevertheless, this approach does not seem to be correct. We never claimed that our man-made systems are 100% perfect. Such claims of 100% perfect systems are only made by religions, while we believe in the evolution of all things in the light of knowledge and experience and observation.</p>

			<title>Ablution (وضو): Does it keeps Safe from Diseases</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Muslim preachers are spreading this video of Neil Tyson, in order to claim that Islam could come only from any DIVINE source, who knew about germs 1400 years ago, and thus asked Muslims to wash their hands and feet 5 times a day before daily prayers. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYgra1kLe7E" frameborder="0" sandbox="" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>It was a common practice to wash yourself before prayers in many religions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ablution">https://www.britannica.com/topic/ablution</a></p>
<p>The devout follower of <span id="ref286708"></span><a class="md-crosslink" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shinto" data-show-preview="true">Shintō</a>, for example, rinses hands and mouth with water before approaching a shrine. Monks of the <span id="ref286709"></span><a class="md-crosslink" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Theravada" data-show-preview="true">Theravāda</a> Buddhist tradition wash themselves in the monastery pool before meditation. The upper-caste Hindu bathes ceremonially in water before performing daily morning worship (<em>pūjā</em>) in the home. <span id="ref286710"></span>Jewish law requires <a class="md-crosslink autoxref" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ritual" data-show-preview="true">ritual</a> <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immersion" data-term="immersion" data-type="MW">immersion</a> of their whole bodies by women prior to marriage and after menstruation, as well as by new converts to Judaism. Washing of the hands after rising in the morning and before meals that include bread are also examples of ablution in Judaism. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Muhammad took this practice from Zoroastrians:</h2>
<p>Zoroastrians were also praying 5 times a day, and they also had to do ablution before the prayers, known as PĀDYĀB.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You can read about it here: <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/padyab" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/padyab</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad not only copied the concept of 5 times prayers but also of washing before it from Zoroastrians.</p>
<h2>It is an Over-Kill, which brings other diseases</h2>
<p>Washing your hands 5 times a day is not a problem.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But if you have to wash your hands till elbows and feet too 5 times a day, then it is a waste of water and your time (especially in winter, when your elbows are completely covered in clothes, and feet covered in socks).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Many times Muslims also get cold (in winter), as they have to wash their foot, nose and feet 5 times a day with cold water. They don't always have towels with them to dry their faces and feet.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Many times Muslims get foot fungus (especially in cold areas). It happens while they had to do Wadhu, and then put socks immediately on wet feet.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, washing the face and putting water in the nose 5 times a day in cold winters is also an over-kill, especially for those who don't have a strong immune system.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, sex life at night in winter is also a nightmare. It was a nightmare as you have to take a full body bath very early in the cold morning, and then go to the Fajr Prayer. It is also a recipe for disaster, especially if you have to go to the office on the motorcycle, after having a bath.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is even a bigger nightmare for wives, as they have long hair, and it takes half an hour to dry their hair before Fajr prayer.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(PS: It became even bigger problem when there was no warm water available in winter, or we didn't have enough time to boil water before Fajr prayers. This compelled us to take a bath with cold water)</p>]]></description>

<p class="western" lang="en-GB" style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QiqhTHcxIl8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response:</strong></span></p>
<p>Women should have the freedom to choose what works best for them, whether that means being a stay-at-home mom or pursuing a career. If a woman wants or needs to work, it doesn’t inherently harm the child. In fact, research has highlighted several benefits for children raised by working mothers, including positive role modelling and fostering independence. Please see the following scientific study. </p>
<ul>
<li><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017018760167#.WwxcIdoRW9Q.twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Scientific Study: There are countless benefits to being raised by working women</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The first few years of a child’s life are critical for emotional, cognitive, and social development. Both parents, especially the mother, should prioritize spending quality time with their baby during this phase. Ideally, workplaces should provide at least 1-2 years of maternity leave, followed by part-time or flexible options for an additional year or two, allowing parents to focus on their child without sacrificing career aspirations.</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://wtop.com/parenting/2017/05/why-prioritizing-motherhood-in-the-first-three-years-is-critical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Why prioritizing motherhood in first 3 years is critical</a></li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="http://adaanbar.com/how-long-to-stay-home-with-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">How Long to Stay Home with Baby</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After the initial years, the focus on parenting can shift to a more scheduled approach, ensuring that the child continues to receive adequate attention. Mothers shouldn’t feel obligated to stay home permanently, as effective parenting isn’t about always being present physically but about being emotionally and mentally available.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moreover: </p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB"><b>F</b><b>irstly,</b> men also go to work. Does it break the bond between fathers and children? </p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB"><b>Secondly,</b> Muslim men had 4 wives and dozens of slave women for sex purposes, and then dozens of children from them. They saw their children after long periods of time. Did that break the bond between them and their children? If not, how the mother/child bond is going to break if the mother goes to work?</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">Moreover, many Muslim men from poor countries like India, Pakistan etc. go to rich Gulf countries for work, and stay there for years. They hardly see their children once a year. Does it break the bond between them and their children?</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB"><b>Thirdly</b>, Islam broke the families of male and female slaves. Islam has the evil of “<b>Slavery by Birth</b>”. And when a baby has 2 teeth (6 to 8 months), then the owner can separate the baby and sell the child or slave mother, or both in the Islam Bazaars of slavery.</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book Risala:</p>
<blockquote class="western"><span style="font-family: Alvi Nastaleeq;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span lang="ur-PK"><span style="font-family: Arabic Typesetting, cursive;"><b>ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر</b></span></span></span></span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">A slave-mother and her baby could not be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) till the baby has his second tooth.</blockquote>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">As far as the father (i.e. male slave) is concerned, then he can be sold by the owner whenever he wishes, even before the birth of his baby (i.e. the poor slave father didn't even get the chance to see his baby and vice versa).</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">Allah/Muhammad also allowed the master to snatch away the wife of his slave, and to start raping her, thus, destroying the whole slave family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67" data-ve-attributes="{&quot;rel&quot;:&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot;}">Sahih Bukhari, Book of Nikah:</a></p>
<p>[ (25) Chapter: "Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters..."]:</p>
<p>وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.</p>
<p>Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. <strong>But there is no problem if a man (i.e. the owner) takes his (married) female slave (for himself) from his male slave.</strong></p>
<p>[Note: This is our own translation, as<span> </span><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67">Sunnah.Com</a><span> </span>provides only the Arabic text, but didn't translate it into English]</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">Unbelievable!</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB"><b>PS:</b> slave women in Islam are always working for their masters and cannot stay with their children at home. But it seems Islam don't consider slaves to be human beings. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h2>First Example:</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In Islamic Democracies, they go for an <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Islamic System</strong> instead of a <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Secular System</strong>, which turns these Islamic democracies into the "<strong>Dictatorship of Majority</strong>". And the minorities become 2nd or 3rd class citizens in such Islamic democracies, losing many of their basic and <strong>EQUAL</strong> human rights.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, in Islamic democracies, governments are always very weak and never have the power to go against Islamic law. They have to appease their voter bank instead of doing the right thing.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Nevertheless, dictators like Muhammad bin Salman (Saudi Arabia) indeed went against Islamic laws, and he was able to abolish a few draconian Sharia laws.</p>
<h2>Second Example:</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Not only Islamic countries, but radical Hindus also succeeded in turning Indian Democracy into the "<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Dictatorship of the Majority</strong>".</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And to be honest, in the USA too under Trump and some of his far-right supporters, it saw as the "Dictatorship of the Majority".</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Right-Wing Netanyahu in Israel is also moving in the same direction. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Erdogan made democracy a joke in Turkey, and it has become a dictatorship. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Democracy in Russia under Putin is also like a nightmare.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That is why, a democracy without true secular values, has no value. </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Lessons:</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Lesson 1: </strong>It is perhaps a mistake when the Western world put a lot of importance on democracy in the Islamic countries, but didn't put so much importance on the Secular System. They in fact accepted and recognised the so-called combination of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d; text-decoration: underline;">"Democracy" </span>+ <span style="color: #e67e23; text-decoration: underline;">"Islamic System"</span></strong></span>, which is a fatal mistake. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Lesson 2: </strong>Democracy only works with a left-wing electorate, because right-wingers don't believe in democracy. When right-wingers win elections, the first thing they do is try to dismantle democracy, in truth if not in name. That's not an insult, it's the literal definition of right-wing vs left-wing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="560" title="What is the contribution of Atheists to science in history?" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zs-EBE0dcpM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>
<p>Indeed atheism (a non-religious system) provides an OPTIMAL environment for scientific progress. But before moving to atheism and how it supports science, first, let's examine the relationship between Islam and science.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Harms that Islam Inflicted upon Science</h2>
<ul>
<li>Islam made the whole Islamic world get religious education. As a result, Islam produced millions of Islamic Scholars in the last 1400 years, who were involved only in Jurisprudence and Sectarian fights. Compared to those millions of Islamic Scholars, Islam could not produce even a handful of scientists in 1400 years.</li>
<li>And you will not see even a single woman in the list of those earlier Muslim scientists of the last 1400 years, while Islam considers women to be deficient in intelligence, and they had to stay at home in the name of "Islamic Modesty". </li>
<li>Moreover, the prohibition of studying human anatomy by Islam, in the name of "respect" for the deceased hindered medical progress for centuries, impeding critical advancements in the medical field.</li>
<li>And then some Islamic Rulers also made life difficult for many Muslim scientists too due to their sects or atheist leanings. Ibn Sina was hiding his whole life, and he had to write his books in this state of hiding. Al-Razi was hit in his head by his own books in the mosque. Ibn-e-Rushd got the punishment for being an atheist. Yaqub al-Kindi lashed in public.</li>
<li>In contemporary times, schools in many Muslim countries continue to teach that Darwin's Theory of Evolution is incorrect, promoting the belief that humans were directly created by Allah and that Allah directly sent humans to the earth after a woman from the crooked rib of a man deceived him to eat the forbidden apple.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A challenge to Muslims to show that Muslim Scientists ever extracted any scientific discovery from the Quran or Hadith</strong></h2>
<p>Please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the earlier Muslim scientists ever claimed to derive scientific discoveries directly from the Quran or Hadith.</li>
<li>Muslims were initially introduced to Greek/Roman scientific works through their conquests in Egypt and other regions. Later, Abbasid Caliph Mamun (d. 213 Hijri year) ordered the translation of these works into Arabic. Only after this development did Muslim scientists begin to emerge.</li>
<li>Muslims assert that the Sahaba (companions) of Muhammad were the best of Muslim generations. However, despite reading the Quran and Hadith throughout their lives, the Sahaba and the subsequent 5 to 10 Muslim generations were unable to extract any scientific knowledge from the Quran and the Hadith.</li>
<li>Present-day Muslims also struggle to extract scientific discoveries directly from the Quran/Hadith, often relying on science to make new findings before connecting them to the Quran.</li>
</ul>
<div data-reddit-rtjson="{&quot;entityMap&quot;:{},&quot;blocks&quot;:[{&quot;key&quot;:&quot;a55p1&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Thus, the CREDIT of early Muslim scientists and the \&quot;Islamic Golden Age of Science\&quot; does not go to the Quran or Hadith, but to the translated scientific work of Greek/Roman scientists, to those Muslim scientists as individuals, and to Muslim rulers of that time who supported the scientific work. &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;unstyled&quot;,&quot;inlineStyleRanges&quot;:[{&quot;offset&quot;:10,&quot;length&quot;:6,&quot;style&quot;:&quot;BOLD&quot;},{&quot;offset&quot;:53,&quot;length&quot;:29,&quot;style&quot;:&quot;BOLD&quot;}],&quot;entityRanges&quot;:[],&quot;data&quot;:{}}]}">Thus, the <strong>CREDIT</strong> for the accomplishments of early Muslim scientists and the "Islamic Golden Age of Science" does not belong to the Quran or Hadith, but rather to the translated scientific works of Greek and Roman scientists, to individual Muslim scientists, and to Muslim rulers of the time who supported scientific endeavors.</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">97% of the Scientific Community supports Evolution and rejects the theory of Creation today</h2>
<p>There wasn't an organized atheist movement advocating for atheism during the past few centuries. Despite this, a vast majority of the scientific community today, estimated to be around 97%, supports the theory of evolution and rejects the idea of creationism and the story of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution</a></p>

<p>Nearly all (around 97%) of the scientific community accepts evolution as the dominant scientific theory of biological diversity, with 87% accepting that evolution occurs due to natural processes, such as <a title="Natural selection" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection">natural selection</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-pew_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-pew-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Scientific associations have strongly rebutted and refuted the challenges to evolution proposed by <a title="Intelligent design" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design">intelligent design</a> proponents.<sup id="cite_ref-dover_pg83_3-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-dover_pg83-3">[3]</a></sup> ...

</blockquote>
<p>In simple words, today the fathers of Physics, Chemistry, Biology etc., who are making scientific discoveries, are almost all ATHEISTS.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is FACTUALLY WRONG. There have been hundreds of atheist scientists some founders of new branches of science: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_atheists_in_science_and_technology">List of Atheists in Science &amp; Technology.</a></p>
<p>Thirdly, look at how atheists faced hardships in the past:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_atheists">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_atheists</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There were <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">laws on the books</a> against atheism. In continental Europe, <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Dolet" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">atheism was punishable by death</a>. The death penalty for atheism was only abolished in the <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_Jurisdiction_Act_1677" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">United Kingdom in 1677</a>. Virtually all institutions of higher learning prior to the late 1800s were religious. In the United Kingdom, you could not attend Cambridge and Oxford unless you subscribed to the 39 Articles of the Church of England, a practice that was only <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Tests_Act_1871" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">abolished in 1871</a>. Clearly, these men weren't Christians because of choice, but because there was no other alternative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, the reason "Many great scientists believed in god in the past!" was because prior to the late 1800s, you had to openly profess belief in god or risk imprisonment and death for being an atheist. It was only during the second half of the 19th century that atheism became a respectable position.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion: </h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Atheists don't have any MONOPOLY upon science. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But Atheism naturally promotes freethinking and thus supports scientific progress in an OPTIMAL way. While compared to Atheism, religious systems don't optimally support science.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islam produced millions of Scholars of Jurisprudence and the Quran/Hadith, but only a handful of scientists during the last 14 centuries. But when the non-religious system became stronger in Europe, then look at how science was supported and it progressed at a rapid pace. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islam failed to produce even a handful of female scientists during 1400 years. But look how the non-religious system supported women and today universities are producing thousands of female scientists every year. Even today, if a few Muslim women are becoming scientists, then it is not due to Islam, but due to the reason that the present non-religious system even promotes and supports Muslim women too to become scientists. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And look, even Galileo was religious, but his heliocentric discoveries were suppressed by the church, delaying technological progress. In the case of a clash between religion and science, religion killed scientific discoveries or slowed down their progress. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Religions showed us 1000s of years of scientific dark age/stagnation. Whatever progress we saw was sporadic or because of a few benevolent and curious rulers, who funded scholars. However, a few centuries of secularism and separation of church and state has given us an exponential amount of technological growth. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, the Muslim preacher takes credit for scientists being theists, but in the same way, will he take the blame for all those massacres done by theists? Probably no. He will be the first one to say terrorism has no religion.</li>

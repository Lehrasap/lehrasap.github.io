			<title>The Ridiculous Level of Incoherence in the Quran</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/quran/88-the-ridiculous-level-of-incoherence-in-the-quran</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/quran/88-the-ridiculous-level-of-incoherence-in-the-quran</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Quran's level of incoherence has left thousands of the most prominent Quranic commentators from the past 14 centuries grappling to comprehend it, yet they have been unable to fully do so.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this confusion is the presence of verses revealed during the Meccan period within the Medinan Surahs, and vice versa. This intermingling makes it incredibly challenging for an ordinary person to discern which incident each verse refers to.</p>
<p>The disorderliness is not confined to the arrangement of Surahs alone; it extends even within individual verses. For instance, a single verse might begin discussing one event, then abruptly shift to another event that occurred years later, only to circle back and address the initial event in its third part. This internal disarray adds to the difficulty of comprehending the Quran's intended message (if it really has any). </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at this verse from the Quran:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Quran 5:3)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="color: #0101ff;"><strong><i>(1st part of the verse about the event 1)</i></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, and the strangled (animal) and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression </span><span style="color: #ff0101;"><b>(2nd part of the verse about the event 2, which happened many years later)</b></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion;<span style="color: #0101ff;"> </span></span><span style="color: #0101ff;"><b>(</b><b>3rd part of the verse, which again starts talking about the event 1)</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All Quranic commentators unanimously agree that this particular verse presents a unique case of discontinuity:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part of the verse pertains to Haram (prohibited) foods and was revealed during the <strong>6th Hijri year</strong>, specifically during the Pact of Hudaybiyyah.</li>
<li>However, the 2nd (middle) part of the same verse unexpectedly shifts the topic to the "<strong>Perfection of Religion</strong>." This portion of the verse was revealed at a completely different time in the <strong>10th Hijri year</strong>, approximately 81 days prior to the death of Muhammad. Interestingly, this section has no apparent connection to the preceding part of the verse.</li>
<li>Finally, the 3rd and last part of the verse (or sentence) circles back to address the initial incident concerning Haram foods. This part was also revealed during the event of the Pact of Hudaybiyyah in the <strong>6th Hijri year</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maulana Modoodi wrote in his commentary of the Quran under this verse:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“According to authentic traditions, this 2nd part of the verse (about the perfection of religion) was revealed at the time of “Last Sermon” in the </span><b>10th Hijri year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the initial part of the verse was about the Pact of Hudaybiyyah (which happened in the<strong> </strong></span><strong><i>6th Hijri year</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maulana Taqi Uthmani wrote in his commentary of the Quran under this verse:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Jews said to Umar Ibn Khattab, had this verse “This day have I perfected for you your religion” revealed upon them, then they would have taken it as a day of Eid (celebration). Upon that Umar told the Jews that they didn't know that two Eids of Muslims were combined on this day. This verse was revealed in the <b><i>10 th Hijri year</i></b> at the incident of "Last Sermon" at the place of "Urfa" at the time of "Asr Prayer". There were 40 thousand companions with prophet Muhammad. And the holy prophet remained alive for 81 days after this incident.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there any other book besides the Quran that exhibits such a high level of incoherence?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, even the Bible contains instances of incoherence, but it still surpasses the Quran in terms of clarity and comprehensibility. A regular person can read the Bible and understand it to a considerable extent. However, this is not the case with the Quran, as it remains profoundly challenging for an ordinary individual to grasp, despite the Quran's claims and the assertions of Muslims that Allah designed it to be easily understood.</p>
<p>The most remarkable miracle, in fact, lies in how billions of Muslims can consider such an incoherent book like the Quran to be a divine miracle.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why don't Muslims perceive these problems with the Quran?</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Consider the phenomenon of conformity seen in experiments, where a newcomer adopts the behavior of a group without necessarily understanding the reasons behind it. For instance, if the entire group starts clapping, the newcomer also begins clapping without any specific reason.</p>
<p>It is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments#:~:text=During%20Asch%27s%20experiment%2C%20participants%20choose,trend%20that%20is%20apparently%20wrong">Asch conformity experiment</a>. People may follow the wrong trend just to keep up with a group.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Till the time Islam was weak during the Meccan period and the initial Medinan period, Quranic verses taught peace and tolerance and justice. But as soon as Islam became stronger in the later Medinan period, then it started teaching violence, cruelty, coercion, and intolerance.</p>
<p>Let us compare Quranic Verses during these 2 periods to see these double standards of the Quran.</p>

<p>In the 9th Hijri year, Muhammad got “absolute power” and no one was left there in the entire Arabia who could have opposed him. Thus, then in the 9th Hijri year, Muhammad claimed the revelation of verse 9:5 and made the killing of all polytheists Halal (permissible) for Muslims after 4 months (or after the expiration date for those Arab tribes, who made the treaties with Muhammad after the victory of Mecca).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/9.5">9:5</a>:</p>
<p>(After 4 months) kill all the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Quranic verse 9:29 again testifies the same thing that the order of killing all polytheists was not due to the reason that they were fighting Muslims, but it was due to the reason that they didn’t believe in Allah and Muhammad.</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">(Quran 9:29) Fight those people of the Book (Jews and Christians) who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, do not refrain from what has been prohibited by Allah and His Messenger and do not embrace the religion of truth (Al-Islam), until they pay Jizya (protection tax) with their own hands and feel themselves subdued.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This verse also allows Jizya from only the “People of the Book” (i.e. Jews and Christians and Zoroastrians), while polytheists were not even allowed to live after paying the Jizya. <strong>Polytheists either had to accept Islam, or they would be killed after 4 months (or till the end of their covenant). </strong></p>
<p>And then there are traditions which are clear about how Muslims killed even peaceful polytheists after the revelation of this verse:</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, Book of Battles (<a href="http://www.hadithurdu.com/01/1-2-1544/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">Narrated Jarir: In the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance there was a house called Dhu-l-Khalasa or Al-Ka'ba Al-Yamaniya or Al-Ka'ba Ash-Shamiya. The Prophet said to me, "Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l-Khalasa?" So I set out with one-hundred-and-fifty riders, and we dismantled it and killed whoever was present there. Then I came to the Prophet and informed him, and he invoked good upon us and Al-Ahmas (tribe) .</blockquote>
<p>Musanif Ibn Abi Shaybah, 6/586, Kitab-ul-Hadood, chapter of في الزنادقة ما حدهم (<a href="http://hadithportal.com/index.php?show=bab&amp;bab_id=4412&amp;chapter_id=24&amp;book=62&amp;sub_idBab=0&amp;f=4245&amp;e=4426">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">Some people used to worship their idols secretly. They were arrested and brought to 4th caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib. He consulted the people how to punish them. People suggested to kill them. Ali said: No, I will not simply kill them, but I will do that act which was performed by them against my ancestor Abraham. After that Ali burnt all of them in the fire.</blockquote>
<p>And when Umar Ibn Khattab conquered Persia, he used this same verse 9:5 as an argument to kill them, and all the Sahaba (companions) stayed quiet upon it and no one opposed Umar Ibn Khattab by telling him that this verse was limited to Polytheist of Mecca or Arabia only. Therefore, there was an IJMA (unanimous decision) by Sahaba upon this verse, it orders the killing of all the Polytheists.</p>
<p>But then Umar Ibn Khattab didn’t kill the Persians while Ali and 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf told him that Zoroastrians of Persia were also counted as “People of the Book” by Prophet Muhammad. Thus, he took Jazya from them, and then he let them live.</p>
<p>Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqallani recorded this Sahih (authentic) tradition (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151001053419/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?flag=1&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=5744">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">وروى عبد بن حميد في تفسير سورة البروج بإسناد صحيح عن ابن أبزى " لما هزم المسلمون أهل فارس قال عمر : اجتمعوا . فقال : إن المجوس ليسوا أهل كتاب فنضع عليهم ، ولا من عبدة الأوثان فنجري عليهم أحكامهم فقال علي : بل هم أهل كتاب "’<br>Translation:<br>When Muslims defeated the Persians, then Umar Ibn Khattab asked Sahaba (companions) to gather and to tell him what to do with the Persians as they are neither from the “People of Book” that they could take Jizya from them, and nor were they the polytheists that they should all be killed. Upon that Ali Ibn Abi Talib told him that Zoroastrians were also counted as “People of the Book”.</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Persians escaped the slaughter while they were also counted as the “People of the Book”, otherwise they would have also been killed as polytheists.</p>
<p>This shows that the order of killing the polytheists was neither limited to the era of Muhammad (but this order stays true even after his death), nor it was limited to only Arabia, but to the whole world. And it was also not limited to the battlefield, while the Persians had already been defeated, and had already surrendered, but still, Umar Ibn Khattab wanted to kill them all had they not accepted Islam. </p>
<p>And now look at this “authentic” tradition of Sunan Abu Dawud (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151001054259/http://dorar.net/h/0916f8e2ca3e8b9006f8ca7e4cf93e8c">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">لم يكن عمر يأخذ الجزية من المجوس حتى شهد عبد الرحمن بن عوف أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذها من مجوس هجر .<br>Translation:<br>Umar Ibn Khattab didn’t want to take Jizya (but wanted to kill them all), but 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf told him that Prophet Muhammad took Jizya from the Zoroastrians of the place of Hijr.</blockquote>
<p>Imam Shafii, Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal, and Imam Ibn Hazam all said that all polytheists of the entire world should be killed according to this verse 9:5, and no Jizya can be taken from them, and they have only one choice to save their life i.e. to accept Islam.</p>
<p>While Abu Hanifa limited this order only to the polytheists of Arabia, while the non-Arab polytheists could pay Jizya and stay alive according to him. Nevertheless, Abu Hanifa went against the Ijm'a of Sahaba, where Umar Ibn Khattab wanted to kill the non-Arab Persians due to this verse, and all Sahaba agreed with him (but Persians escaped this genocide while it was proved that they were also from the People of the Book). </p>
<p>Thus, Imam Shafii and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal rejected the opinion of Abu Hanfia, by using the Ijma (unanimous decision) of Sahaba, where none of them rejected the opinion of Umar that all polytheists should be killed.</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">Shafii and Hanbali Scholars used the decision of Umar Ibn Khattab that only the “people of the Book” are allowed to live after paying Jizya. Umar was in doubt if Zoroastrians of Persian were included in “people of book” or not. Thus, had it been proved upon him that they were not from the “people of the book”, then he would have compelled them to accept Islam like the polytheists, and if they had rejected to accept Islam, then he would have killed them all.<br>References:<br>(1) Imam Shafii, Kitab al-Am, vol. 4, page 174<br>(2) Ibn Qadammah Hanbali, Book al-Mughani, vol. 9, page 173</blockquote>
<p>PS: <br>The Muslim Sultans, who conquered India, took Jizya from Hindus too and didn't kill them. It was due to the reason that they were the followers of Hanafi Fiqh, and Imam Abu Hanifa allowed them to take Jizya from the non-Arab polytheists. This saved the Hindus from being slaughtered. </p>
<p>Present-day Salafis still consider that all polytheists of the whole world should be killed according to the order of this verse 9:5.</p>
<p>Saudi Grand Mufti Ibn Baaz wrote (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151001042634/http://www.binbaz.org.sa/node/277">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">، والأرجح أنه لا يلحق بهم غيرهم ، بل هؤلاء الطوائف الثلاث هم الذين يخيرون ؛ لأن الرسول قاتل الكفار في الجزيرة ولم يقبل منهم إلا الإسلام ،<br>Translation:<br>And the correct view is this that polytheists (of today) do not come under the category of “people of the book”, but only Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians are allowed to live by paying Jizya, while Prophet Muhammad killed all the polytheists in Arabia and accepted nothing from them, except Islam.</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #0107ff;"><em><strong>That is why ISIS allowed the Christians of Iraq to pay Jizya and didn’t kill them. But ISIS didn’t accept any Jizya from the Yazidi community of Iraq, and they killed the Yazidi men and took all their women and children as slaves.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If Shafii, Hanbalis or Salafists of today form an Islamic State/Caliphate today, then again they will start killing all the polytheists (including Atheists) and will not accept any Jizya from them.</strong></span> In this regard, there is no difference of opinion between ISIS and the Salafists (and all the followers of Imam Sahafii and Ahmed bin Hanbal). </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/11/default.htm">4:11</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِىٓ أَوْلَٰدِكُمْ ۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ ۚ فَإِن كُنَّ <span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong>نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ</strong></span> فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ ۖ وَإِن كَانَتْ وَٰحِدَةً فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصْفُ ۚ </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Instructs you Allah concerning your children - for the male like (the) portion (of) two females. But if there are (only) women (i.e. daughters) </span><span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;">more (than) two</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, then for them two thirds (of) what he left. And if (there) is (only) one, then for her (is) half. (</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;verse=11">Word by Word Translation by Corpus Quran</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allah is incorrectly using the phrase “<strong>more than two daughters</strong>” when He actually wanted to say “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”.</p>
<p>Please read the detailed article <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/166-quran-s-mathematical-mistakes-in-the-inheritance-laws">here.</a></p>
<p>It is a clear linguistic mistake, and it happened while no Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own, and he was not safe from making human mistakes like these. </p>
<p>All Muslim Scholars agree that two daughters will get 2/3 of the estate.</p>
<p>Muhammad himself distributed 2/3rd of the estate between two daughters. </p>
<p>Sunan Tirmidhi, 2092:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The wife of Sa’d bin Rabi’ came with the two daughters of Sa’d to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, these are the two daughters of Sa’d. He was killed with you on the day of Uhud, and their paternal uncle has taken all that their father left behind, and a woman is only married for her wealth.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent until the Verse of inheritance was revealed to him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the brother of Sa’d bin Rabi’ and said: ‘Give the two daughters of Sa’d two thirds of his wealth, and give his wife on eighth, and take what is left.’”</p>

<h2>Tehrif (Distortion) Case:</h2>
<p>It was such a big error, that modern Muslims Quran Translators have to make a TEHRIF (Distortion) in its translation, and change it to “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”. For example, look at the translation of Yousuf Ali. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Quran 4:11</a>) Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, <span style="color: #236fa1; background-color: #eccafa;"><strong>two or more</strong></span>, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. (<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Yusuf Ali, Saudi Revised Edition,1985</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here are some other modern Quran Translators, who followed this distorted translation of “two or more daughters”. </p>

<li><a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st59.htm">Mohammad Shafi</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Compared to these modern translators, we have other translators too, who didn't make any Tehrif in the translation, and they translated it correctly, i.e. “more than two daughters”. They are:</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that modern Muslim apologists have made dishonesty HALAL for themselves. They distort, they hide, they tell clear lies ... but the truth will still become evident. </p>]]></description>

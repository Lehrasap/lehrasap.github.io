		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;No sane person can accept that there should be a death penalty for changing religion. Thus Islamic apologists fabricated a lame excuse, where they started claiming:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The act of apostasy in Islam can be seen as equivalent to committing treason against a modern-day state. Just as a state would punish its citizens who support its enemies and betray the constitution, Islamic law also provides consequences for those who abandon the religion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to distinguish between two types of laws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;State Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Personal Beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State laws regulate &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERACTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between individuals and are applicable when two or more people have to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with each other. On the other hand, personal beliefs pertain to an individual's values, and practices, and are not concerned with &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dealings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic apologist's argument that apostasy in Islam is equivalent to committing treason against a modern-day state is flawed because it blurs the line between state laws and personal beliefs. While a state may punish its citizens for supporting its enemies or betraying the constitution, religious beliefs and affiliations fall under personal values. The decision to change one's religion is a matter between an individual and their deity, and does not involve any harm or injury to others (i.e. it does not deal with other individuals). Therefore, it is not possible for the state to impose penalties for apostasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Islamic apologists are trying to impose those non-human laws today, against which their own Prophets REBELLED. Yes, Muhammad himself rebelled against his own community and he called their idol Gods to be false deities and refused to follow them. Yes, Ibrahim himself broke the idol gods of his community. Why didn’t then Muhammad and Ibrahim become worthy to be killed for APOSTASY? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Instead of calling Muhammad and Ibrahim to be TRAITORS and worthy of being killed, Islamic apologists start presenting them as innocent oppressed (مظلوم) figures, and pagans as tyrants (ظالم), while they tried to stop them from criticizing their gods. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These are only Double Standards of Muslim apologists. Islam itself started following the Sunnah of Pagans in this case (actually, much worse as pagans didn’t kill him or other Muslim converts, but they only tried to stop them from criticizing their gods, which was itself a wrong thing to do). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Analysis of the Arguments of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58VckD6RoEA&amp;amp;t=9s&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Muslim Lantern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Muslim Lantern is also a famous Islamic apologist. He presented the following excuses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/58VckD6RoEA?t=9s&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The First Excuse: Democracy Allows the Majority to Make Any Law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent video, The Muslim Lantern presented the argument that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liberals believe in democracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democracy allows the majority to establish any rule for their state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, it is hypocritical for liberals to criticize the decision of a Muslim majority in an Islamic state to enact apostasy laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims like The Muslim Lantern either misunderstand the Western system or deliberately misrepresent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the Western system is not primarily based on democracy but on &lt;strong&gt;secularism.&lt;/strong&gt; Democracy is merely a branch of secularism and cannot override core secular values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are these secular values? Understand that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secularism is a system that prioritizes humanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It respects all individuals, regardless of their religion, race, or language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It guarantees &lt;strong&gt;equal human rights&lt;/strong&gt; to all its citizens, irrespective of their religion or race or language, or irrespective of being from a majority group or a minority group. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, humanity within us is ENOUGH to guide us towards what is right and what is wrong. Thus, BASIC Human Rights are primary issues, and they are not based  upon the dictatorship of majority, but they are based upon the guidance of humanity. The majority decision in democracy is only limited to 'secondary' issues which we have to solve in our daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in a secular system, the majority does not have the right to infringe upon the equal rights of minorities. This is why, in a true secular society, it would be impossible for a majority to pass unjust laws like the apostasy laws seen in many Islamic countries, where the majority acts as a dictator and unilaterally strips non-Muslim minorities of their right to change their religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Excuse: An Open Apostate Incites Others to Commit Crimes Like Stealing and Drinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument from The Muslim Lantern is completely baseless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An open apostate does not incite others to commit crimes like stealing or killing. As for drinking alcohol, it is the right of non-Muslims, just as Indian Muslims have the right to eat meat in a predominantly Hindu country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expressing one's religious beliefs or ideology to others is not &lt;strong&gt;INCITEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;; it is known as &lt;strong&gt;PREACHING&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preaching is a fundamental human right that falls under freedom of expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are simply double standards on the part of some Muslims, who call it preaching when they do it but label it incitement when non-Muslims do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: Was Muhammad preaching to the Meccan pagans, or was he inciting them? Were the Meccans justified in torturing and killing Muslims simply because they were preaching Islam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is, Islamic apologists have not way to escape, except for showing Double Standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Analysis of Daniel Haqiqatjou's Arguments:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video of Daniel where he is defending the Islamic Apostasy Law of killing people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Xrep03qSRs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All his justifications for killing apostates (i.e., those leaving Islam) hinge on the argument that colonizers also restricted freedom of speech and punished those who spoke against the Crown and the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are two major flaws in Daniel's reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, what colonizers did was based on &quot;State Law&quot; and concerned matters between individuals and the state. In contrast, colonizers did not execute people for changing their personal religious beliefs, as these beliefs do not constitute treason against the state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, even the colonizers' &quot;State Laws&quot; were flawed, which is why modern secular states have abolished those barbaric practices and now allow criticism of both state laws and the crown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with Islam is its rigidity and inability to reform. It turned a personal matter into a state crime and shows no capacity to correct this mistake. Muslims are forced to live with these severe errors in Islamic law, as they cannot alter Sharia rulings on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Sharia orders Muslims if any non-Muslim state does not allow Muslims to preach Islam, and to let people convert to Islam, then it becomes &lt;strong&gt;obligatory&lt;/strong&gt; for Muslims to wage war against that non-Muslim state (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/85662/restrictions-placed-by-muslims-on-non-muslims-etc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, the questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should non-Muslims today also wage a war against Islamic countries and punish them for not allowing non-Muslims to preach and to let people leave Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And why should non-Muslim states today allow Muslims to immigrate in their countries, instead of waging a war against them? And why should they allow Muslims to preach and let people convert to Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple words, Muslim excuses of treason etc. are not correct, and Islamic Sharia is only based upon&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Double Standards, Hypocrisy, and the rule of Might is Right&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Analysis of Zakir Naik's Argument:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGHHx0q4MA8&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To paraphrase Dr Zakir Naiks answer to this direct question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teaching about Islam is like teaching people 2+2=4. Now with that in mind should we allow people to teach to people 2+2=5? We know islam is true, so why should we allow anyone to teach something that is not true. Nobody would allow anyone to teach to people 2+2=5. So why should we allow people to teach other religions than islam knowing they are all untrue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no PROOF that 80% of the world's population (i.e. non-Muslims) is making the mistake of 2+2=5. It is equally possible that these are Muslims who are making the mistake of 2+2=5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't it your own Quran that says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.111&quot;&gt;2:111&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;قُلْ هَاتُوا۟ بُرْهَٰنَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Say, 'Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Zakir Naik is not providing proof; he is &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; making an &lt;strong&gt;empty CLAIM&lt;/strong&gt; that all non-Muslims are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we ask Zakir Naik and his followers: Where is the proof?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since no one truly knows if there is a god (or gods) in the heavens, everyone has the right to &quot;bring their proof.&quot; If the evidence presented by Muslims holds any weight, then non-Muslims will naturally accept Islam. Conversely, if the evidence goes against Islam, people will naturally leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if 80% of the world’s population (i.e., non-Muslims) also made an empty claim that Islam is false and that Muslims are teaching 2+2=5? Does this give them the right to ban the preaching of Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, why do Islamic apologists want to apply double standards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Zakir Naik's argument about treason, we've already addressed it: it's a weak excuse. Religious beliefs fall under &quot;personal values and practices,&quot; not &quot;state laws,&quot; and therefore cannot be considered treason against the state.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Story of the Bloodthirsty WOLF and the LAMB: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Do you remember that story where the wolf kept on making lame excuses one by one, that the lamb was making his drinking water dirty, or he abused him last year, or it was his father who abused him. And at the end, the wolf killed the lamb on the basis of those lies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Muslim apologists are exactly those bloodthirsty wolves. They will tell every type of lie and make every type of lame excuse in order to achieve their wicked plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Islamophobia_is_wolfophobia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Islamophobia is equal to Wolfophobia&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/Islamophobia_is_wolfophobia.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Apostate_Death_Punishment.jpg&quot;&gt;In Image Format&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;No sane person can accept that there should be a death penalty for changing religion. Thus Islamic apologists fabricated a lame excuse, where they started claiming:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The act of apostasy in Islam can be seen as equivalent to committing treason against a modern-day state. Just as a state would punish its citizens who support its enemies and betray the constitution, Islamic law also provides consequences for those who abandon the religion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to distinguish between two types of laws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;State Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Personal Beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State laws regulate &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERACTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between individuals and are applicable when two or more people have to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with each other. On the other hand, personal beliefs pertain to an individual's values, and practices, and are not concerned with &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dealings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic apologist's argument that apostasy in Islam is equivalent to committing treason against a modern-day state is flawed because it blurs the line between state laws and personal beliefs. While a state may punish its citizens for supporting its enemies or betraying the constitution, religious beliefs and affiliations fall under personal values. The decision to change one's religion is a matter between an individual and their deity, and does not involve any harm or injury to others (i.e. it does not deal with other individuals). Therefore, it is not possible for the state to impose penalties for apostasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Muslim Lantern is also a famous Islamic apologist. He presented the following excuses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Sharia orders Muslims if any non-Muslim state does not allow Muslims to preach Islam, and to let people convert to Islam, then it becomes &lt;strong&gt;obligatory&lt;/strong&gt; for Muslims to wage war against that non-Muslim state (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/85662/restrictions-placed-by-muslims-on-non-muslims-etc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, the questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should non-Muslims today also wage a war against Islamic countries and punish them for not allowing non-Muslims to preach and to let people leave Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And why should non-Muslim states today allow Muslims to immigrate in their countries, instead of waging a war against them? And why should they allow Muslims to preach and let people convert to Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple words, Muslim excuses of treason etc. are not correct, and Islamic Sharia is only based upon&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Double Standards, Hypocrisy, and the rule of Might is Right&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Analysis of Zakir Naik's Argument:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGHHx0q4MA8&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To paraphrase Dr Zakir Naiks answer to this direct question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teaching about Islam is like teaching people 2+2=4. Now with that in mind should we allow people to teach to people 2+2=5? We know islam is true, so why should we allow anyone to teach something that is not true. Nobody would allow anyone to teach to people 2+2=5. So why should we allow people to teach other religions than islam knowing they are all untrue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no PROOF that 80% of the world's population (i.e. non-Muslims) is making the mistake of 2+2=5. It is equally possible that these are Muslims who are making the mistake of 2+2=5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't it your own Quran that says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.111&quot;&gt;2:111&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;قُلْ هَاتُوا۟ بُرْهَٰنَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Say, 'Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Zakir Naik is not providing proof; he is &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; making an &lt;strong&gt;empty CLAIM&lt;/strong&gt; that all non-Muslims are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we ask Zakir Naik and his followers: Where is the proof?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since no one truly knows if there is a god (or gods) in the heavens, everyone has the right to &quot;bring their proof.&quot; If the evidence presented by Muslims holds any weight, then non-Muslims will naturally accept Islam. Conversely, if the evidence goes against Islam, people will naturally leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if 80% of the world’s population (i.e., non-Muslims) also made an empty claim that Islam is false and that Muslims are teaching 2+2=5? Does this give them the right to ban the preaching of Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, why do Islamic apologists want to apply double standards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Zakir Naik's argument about treason, we've already addressed it: it's a weak excuse. Religious beliefs fall under &quot;personal values and practices,&quot; not &quot;state laws,&quot; and therefore cannot be considered treason against the state.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Story of the Bloodthirsty WOLF and the LAMB: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Do you remember that story where the wolf kept on making lame excuses one by one, that the lamb was making his drinking water dirty, or he abused him last year, or it was his father who abused him. And at the end, the wolf killed the lamb on the basis of those lies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Muslim apologists are exactly those bloodthirsty wolves. They will tell every type of lie and make every type of lame excuse in order to achieve their wicked plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How can the Pakistani State and its Muslim citizens advocate for the right to &lt;strong&gt;preach&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;convert&lt;/strong&gt; people to Islam in Western countries while denying the same rights to non-Muslims within Pakistan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deflect criticism and international pressure, regarding allowing Muslims to leave Islam, the Pakistani State adopts the tactic of officially not having an apostasy law. However, the reality is even grimmer for ex-Muslims, as the State resorts to charging them with blasphemy if they choose to renounce Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exacerbates the situation for ex-Muslims, considering that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In cases of apostasy, one may potentially save their life by reverting to Islam within three days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, under blasphemy charges, &lt;strong&gt;repentance is not allowed in blasphemy cases, and the person should necessarily be killed&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, they may spend around a decade in prison without any opportunity for bail before facing the ultimate punishment of death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the complexity, the blasphemy law lacks a precise definition of what constitutes blasphemy. Instead, the definition is vague, stating that any Pakistani Muslim who feels their religious sentiments have been hurt, directly or indirectly, due to the actions or reasons of another (mostly a non-Muslim) person, can level blasphemy accusations and initiate a criminal case. For example, if a person leaves Islam and becomes an ex-Muslim, then it may hurt any Muslim and he can file a charge of blasphemy against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistani State skillfully employs this strategy to evade pressure from the Western world, asserting that it lacks apostasy laws while simultaneously subjecting ex-Muslims to the severe consequences of blasphemy charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the story of a Pakistani ex-Muslim apostate here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam_by_country#Pakistan&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam_by_country#Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inheritance and property rights for apostates were prohibited by Pakistan in 1963.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-dforte2_193-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam_by_country#cite_note-dforte2-193&quot;&gt;[190]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1991, Tahir Iqbal, who had converted to Christianity from Islam, was arrested on charges of desecrating a copy of the Qur'an and making statements against Muhammad. While awaiting trial, he was denied bail on the presumption by a Sessions Court and the appeals Division of the &lt;a title=&quot;Lahore High Court&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore_High_Court&quot;&gt;Lahore High Court&lt;/a&gt; that conversion from Islam was a &quot;cognizable offense&quot;. This decision was upheld by the High Court. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was no specific formal law prohibiting apostasy,&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-195&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam_by_country#cite_note-195&quot;&gt;[192]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the laws against apostasy have been effectuated through Pakistan's blasphemy laws.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-196&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam_by_country#cite_note-196&quot;&gt;[193]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Under Article 295 of its penal code, any Pakistani Muslim who feels his or her religious feelings have been hurt, directly or indirectly, for any reason or any action of another Pakistani citizen can accuse blasphemy and open a criminal case against anyone.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-197&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam_by_country#cite_note-197&quot;&gt;[194]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; According to the Federal Shariat Court, the punishment for any type of blasphemy is death.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-198&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam_by_country#cite_note-198&quot;&gt;[195]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; AbdelFatteh Amor has observed that the Pakistani judiciary has tended to hold apostasy to be an offence, although Pakistanis have claimed otherwise.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-199&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam_by_country#cite_note-199&quot;&gt;[196]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The UN expressed concern in 2002 that Pakistan was still issuing death sentences for apostasy.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-200&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam_by_country#cite_note-200&quot;&gt;[197]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Muslims are not only deprived of inheritance and property but they are also forcefully separated from their spouses and children too. According to Islam, the children of ‘apostates’ are still considered Muslims unless they reach adulthood without returning to Islam, in which case they may also be put to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, t&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;here is no option to state “no religion.” on National identity cards, issued by NADRA (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/pakistan/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;). This means, officially there exists not even a single atheist/agnostic in Pakistan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the parliament proposing the apostasy law bill in 2006, as of today in 2024, it has not been enacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason for the delay lies in the fact that the bill initially allowed apostates three days to repent or face execution. However, the shrewd Pakistani State effectively abandoned this bill, opting instead to exert greater control over non-Muslims and ex-Muslims, punishing them more severely and with greater ease using blasphemy laws, and at the same time deceive the International community by telling them Pakistan has full religious liberties and there is no apostasy law in the country. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

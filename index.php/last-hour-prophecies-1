			<description><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Summary:</strong></h1>
<p>There are two sets of prophecies related to tall buildings in Islamic traditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first set includes a prophecy about tall buildings among a total of 11 prophecies. However, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the other 10 prophecies in this set either never happened or have been proven false.</span></strong></li>
<li>The second set is a <strong><span style="color: #2000ff;">misinterpretation </span></strong>by Islamists, who have <span style="color: #2000ff;"><strong>dishonestly </strong></span>altered the original text. The original prophecy actually refers to "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>normal </strong><strong>houses on top of the mountains</strong></span>," but they have manipulated it to say "<span style="color: #2000ff;"><strong>tall buildings surpassing the tops of the mountains</strong></span>."</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>The first set of Ahadith about Tall Buildings, along with accompanying prophecies</h2>
<p>These are the two Ahadith that Islamists cite as evidence for the prophecy about tall buildings.</p>
<p>Sahih al-Bukhari <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7121">7121</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The Hour will not be established (1) till two big groups fight each other whereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one and the same religious doctrine, (2) till about thirty Dajjals (liars) appear, and each one of them will claim that he is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), (3) till the religious knowledge is taken away (by the death of Religious scholars) (4) earthquakes will increase in number (5) time will pass quickly, (6) afflictions will appear, (7) Al-Harj, (i.e., killing) will increase, (8) till wealth will be in abundance ---- so abundant that a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his Zakat, and whenever he will present it to someone, that person (to whom it will be offered) will say, 'I am not in need of it, (9) <strong>till the people compete with one another in constructing high buildings</strong>, (10) till a man when passing by a grave of someone will say, 'Would that I were in his place (11) and till the sun rises from the West. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sunan Ibn Majah <a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:63">63</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... he (the Prophet) said (about the signs of the last hour): 'When the slave woman gives birth to her mistress' (Waki' said: This means when non-Arabs (slave women) will give birth to Arabs") '<strong>and when you see barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds competing in constructing tall buildings</strong>.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response:</strong></span></p>
<p>Tall buildings existed long before Muhammad's time, and they captured people's fascination. Structures like the Egyptian pyramids were constructed at great heights, and it took more than 3,000 years for any man-made building, such as the Eiffel Tower, to surpass them. Thus, if Muhammad made such claims about FUTURE, then how does it become a miracle? </p>
<p>The respected ex-Muslims Hassan Radwan wrote about this prophecy (<a href="https://medium.com/@hassanradwan51/tall-buildings-prophecy-5d1624c04c94">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="2568" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw gu mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gn bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">However as I often say, there are 3 minimum requirements that must be met before a claim to miraculous knowledge can be entertained.</p>

<p id="1fcd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw gu mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gn bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">This claim meets none of these conditions. Here are the reasons why:</p>
<p id="af7f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw gu mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gn bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="mx gv">Firstly</strong><span> </span>the claim that this prophecy is precise &amp; specific, is false.</p>
<p id="3f99" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw gu mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gn bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">How one defines<span> </span><em class="nt">“tall buildings”</em><span> </span>is subjective and differs depending on time period and location ...</p>
<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw gu mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gn bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">But more importantly the prophecy is not <strong>precise</strong> because today’s tall buildings are<span> </span><em class="nt">not</em><span> </span>being built by<span> </span><em class="nt">barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds</em>, but by well heeled, wealthy royalty &amp; businessmen. For example the person behind the construction of Burj Khalifa<em class="nt"><span> </span>— Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum —<span> </span></em>was was never a<span> </span><em class="nt">“barefoot, naked, destitute shepherd”</em><span> </span>but a member of Dubai’s royal family and the son of Sheikh Rashid the second prime minister of the UAE. Likewise, none of those behind the building of Arabia’s tall buildings were ever;<span> </span><em class="nt">“barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1st Objection: The prophecy is not PRECISE and clear about who is going to compete to make tall building</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Untill <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the people</span></strong> compete with one another in constructing high buildings." [Reference: <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7121">Sahih Bukhari 7121</a>]</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sheperds</span></strong> compete in constructing buildings … [Reference: <a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4044">Sunan Ibn Majah 4044</a>]</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shepherds of black camels</strong></span> compete in high buildings. [Reference: <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:50">Sahih Bukhari 50</a>]</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Barefooted, naked, destitute shepherds</strong></span> competing in the construction of higher buildings. [Reference: <a href="https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:60">Riyad ad-Salihin 60</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the descriptions of "people who will compete" are inconsistent and unclear. </p>
<p>If they are only "people", then people, all over the world, all the time compete with each other in making tall building. </p>
<p>If they are "Shepherds of Black Camels", then we are intertested to know who they are. But unfortunately, Islamists never answer us and never tell us who these shepherds of black camel are. They simply escape from this hadith of their prophet. </p>
<p>If Islamists say that these are Arab Sheiks of Dubai and other Gulf countries who are competing with each other in making tall buildings, then the question is if these Sheiks of Gulf countries are 'naked shepherds'? And do they have black camels? Certainly, Muhammad would have not described these rich Arab Sheikhs as "naked shepherds" or barefooted and destitute. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2nd Objection: What is meant by TALL buildings?</strong></span></p>
<p>During Muhammad's era:</p>
<ul>
<li>A two or there story housed was considered a tall building. </li>
<li>A large mosque is a tall building.</li>
<li>A palace is a tall building.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the first issue with this so-called “prophecy” is that Muslims had already constructed impressive buildings during the Umayyad period (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_architecture">known for its distinctive architecture</a>), long before the Hadith collections were compiled. This raises the question: can it truly be considered a prophecy?</p>
<p>That is why Ibn Hajar relates in<span> </span><a class="af nu" href="https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;ID=13027&amp;bk_no=52&amp;flag=1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Fath al-Bari</a><span> </span>that this sign had already happened around the time of Muhammad’s prophethood. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="5dc6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw gu mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gn bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">تقدم في كتاب الإيمان من وجه آخر عن أبي هريرة في سؤال جبريل عن الإيمان قوله في أشراط الساعة ويتطاول الناس في البنيان ، وهي من العلامات التي وقعت عن قرب في زمن النبوة</p>
<p id="c703" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw gu mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gn bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="nt">“It has been related previously in the “Book of Faith” through another chain,<span> </span></em><strong class="mx gv"><em class="nt">from Abu Hurairah regarding Gabriel’s question about faith, his saying (Abu Hurairah’s) regarding the signs of the Hour and the competing in constructing tall buildings: “And this is amongst the signs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that HAPPENED Close to the time of (Muhammad’s) prophethood.</span>””</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3rd Objection: All Other Accompanying Prophecies in This Hadith Have Not Been Fulfilled</strong></span></p>
<p>Another problem is that this prophecy appears within a series of other predictions, many of which are demonstrably false. For the prophecy about tall buildings to hold, the other prophecies in the same series would also need to be true. Here's what the Hadith claims should occur but never did:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Two large groups will fight each other, leading to a significant number of casualties on both sides, despite sharing the same religious doctrine.</strong><br>Comment: This is vague and likely refers to events that had already occurred before Ahadith were compiled (i.e. wars between the companions of the Muhammad). </p>
<p>(2) <strong>Around thirty false prophets (Dajjals) will emerge, each claiming to be Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).</strong><br>Comment: This scenario had already happened before Ahadith were compiled, indicating it's not a prophecy.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Religious knowledge will diminish as religious scholars pass away.</strong><br>Comment: This is identified as a false prophecy, as there is no indication of a significant reduction in religious scholars leading to a loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>(4) <strong>The frequency of earthquakes will increase.</strong><br>Comment: Scientists assert that the observed increase in earthquakes is due to improved detection technology rather than an actual increase in frequency, suggesting this prophecy is incorrect.</p>
<p>(5) <strong>Time will seem to pass quickly.</strong><br>Comment: This observation is vague and subjective, with no clear metric to measure “quickly."</p>
<p>(6) <strong>Afflictions will become more frequent.</strong><br>Comment: This had already been observed during the initial wars among companion of Muhammad [i.e. wars between 'Ali and 'Aisha, 'Ali and Muawiyyah and 'Ali and Khawarij] before Ahadith were compiled, proving it is not a new prophecy.</p>
<p>(7) <strong>Incidents of violence and killing (Al-Harj) will become more common.</strong><br>Comment: This observation is vague and challenging to evaluate, given many folds increase in population and societal dynamics.</p>
<p>(8) <strong>Wealth will become so abundant that wealthy people will struggle to find recipients for their Zakat, with potential beneficiaries refusing it because they don't need it.</strong><br>Comment: This seems to be a false prophecy, as there is no widespread evidence of excessive wealth leading to difficulty in distributing Zakat. In fact, people (especially Muslim countries) have become extremely poor and millions of Muslims are in need of Zakat today. </p>
<p>(9) <strong>People will compete with each other to construct tall buildings.</strong><br>Comment: This trend had already begun during Umayyad Caliphate, before this Hadith was written. Please read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_architecture">Umayyad Architecture here</a>. Moreover, none of the previous stated prophecies in this Hadith have been fulfilled. </p>
<p>Beyond that, the standard for being a “high building” was not high in the minds of Arabs of that era. For example, the houses of the wives of Muhammad were only 5x4 meters (<a href="https://hajjumrahplanner.com/prophet-muhammad-grave/">source</a>). Thus, they considered many houses in Medina to be high buildings during the era of Muhammad too. [<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1878">Sahih al-Bukhari, 1878</a>: Once the Prophet (ﷺ) stood at the top of a (looked out from upon one) castle amongst the castles (or the high buildings) of Medina and said, "Do you see what I see? ...]</p>
<p>(10) <strong>A man passing by a grave will wish he were in the deceased's place.</strong><br>Comment: This is speculative; it's not clear if or when this will happen on a large scale.</p>
<p>(11) <strong>The sun will rise from the West.</strong><br>Comment: This has not occurred, so it's not clear if or when it will happen, or if it absolutely doesn't happen. </p>
<p>(12) <strong>"When a slave woman gives birth to her mistress." (Waki' explained this as non-Arabs giving birth to Arab offspring.)</strong><br>Comment:  It already happened long before the compilation of Ahadith when during the era of Umar Ibn Khattab, Arabs dominated non-Arabs and took their women as slaves, and it resulted in their Arabic speaking off-spring from those non-Arab slaves women. Secondly, the slavery has already been abolished in the whole world by the Western world. So, this Hadith is proven FALSE, as no more slave women are giving birth to their mistresses. </p>
<p>(13) <strong>When barefoot, naked, and destitute shepherds compete to construct tall buildings.</strong><br>Comment:  Arabs were barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds before the capture of Persia and Africa. As soon as Islamic Caliphate and Arabs became richer and richer, they started making castles and high buildings. Please read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_architecture">Umayyad Architecture here</a>. This happened before the compilation of Ahadith. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Note 1: </strong></span></p>
<p>Also, consider that the Nabateans, known for Petra and other stunning structures, constructed buildings in the region centuries before Muhammad, some reaching heights comparable to the Colosseum in Rome. They also developed canals, tunnels, and intricate underground water systems well before that time. In the south, the Sabaeans constructed the city of Shibam with its iconic skyscrapers, the Maarib Dam, and the Ghundam Palace tower. Even the Quran mentions the people of 'Ad and Thamud, who built towering castles and structures, yet were punished for their arrogance, despite their impressive architecture (Quran <a href="https://quran.com/89/6-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">89: 6-9</a>). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Note 2:</strong></span></p>
<p>The timeline of the compilation of Hadith is crucial, as later Muslim generations fabricated hundreds of thousands of Hadith (false statements) to defend and validate their religion.</p>
<p>When any historical incident happened during the life of Muhammad, then many people became DIRECT eye-witnesses to that historical event, and they also narrated that incident further. However, the problem for Muslims was that many of those incidents were exposing Muhammad and Islam and proving them to be false. </p>
<p>Subsequent generations of Islamic apologists took two approaches to control the damage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, they fabricated hundreds of thousands of false Ahadith to counter genuine incidents. </li>
<li>Secondly, they created Ilm-ul-Hadith (Science of Hadith), which should serve as a TOOL to declare any incident as WEAK and UNRELIABLE which exposed Muhammad/Islam.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is impossible to prove these Ahadith as a fabrication as all hadith transmitters were Muslims. However, we are fortunate that <strong>CONTRADICTIONS </strong>in these fabrications expose them as lies. For example, look at the following article: </p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mod-articles-category-title " href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/hadith/41-the-unreliability-of-hadith-and-ilm-ul-hadith/114-the-fabrication-of-ahadith-in-order-to-save-the-honor-of-islam">131 Traditions claimed it was Ishaaq who was slaughtered, while later 133 Traditions were fabricated that claimed it was Ismael who was slaughtered</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is logical to come to conclusion that both sets of these contradictory Ahadith cannot be correct at the same time, and thus at least one set among them is totally fabricated by later coming Muslim Hadith compilers. </p>
<p>Similarly, look at this article where again numerous alleged "Sahih (authentic) Ahadith" were fabricated, but luckily all of them got exposed due to their contradiction with the Quran. </p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mod-articles-category-title " href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/hadith/41-the-unreliability-of-hadith-and-ilm-ul-hadith/295-the-alleged-incident-of-the-splitting-of-the-moon-proves-the-unreliability-of-hadith-and-ilm-ul-hadith">The alleged incident of the splitting of the moon proves the UNRELIABILITY of Hadith and Ilm-ul-Hadith</a></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>The 2nd Set of Ahadith: Tall buildings surpassing the tops of the mountains... OR ... Houses on mountain tops? </h2>
<p>Islamists present the following tradition (<a href="https://hadithanswers.com/tall-buildings-in-makkah-a-sign-of-qiyamah/">source</a>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (radiyallahu ‘anhuma) is reported to have said: “……When you see tunnels/canals being dug in Makkah Mukarramah and the buildings (of Makkah Mukarramah) <strong>higher than the peak of the mountains</strong> then know that Qiyamah is close.”</p>
<p>(Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah, Hadith: 14306)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response:</strong></span></p>
<p>This Hadith has been misrepresented. A closer examination of similar traditions reveals that they actually refer to "buildings on top of mountains", not "tall buildings higher than the peak of mountains". This clarification becomes evident when we consider all the relevant Ahadith on this topic, which collectively provide ample clarity that the correct interpretation is indeed "buildings or houses on top of mountains".</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Muṣṣanaf<em> </em>Ibn Abi Shayba [Vol. 5, no. 14289]</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>حدثنا غندر عن شعبة عن يعلى بن عطاء عن أبيه قال كنت آخذا بلجام دابة عبد الله بن عمرو فقال كيف أنتم إذا هدمتم هذا البيت فلم تدعوا حجرا على حجر؟ قالوا ونحن على الإسلام؟ قال ونحن على الإسلام، قلت ثم ماذا؟ قال ثم يبنى أحسن ما كان فإذا رأيت مكة قد بعجت كظائم، ورأيت البناء يعلو رؤوس الجبال فاعلم أن الأمر قد أظلك</p>
<p>Ghunder narrated to us from Shu'ba from Ya'la ibn 'Ata' from his father, who said: "I was holding the reins of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr's mount, and he said, 'What will you do when you tear down this House (the Kaaba), leaving not one stone upon another?' They asked, 'While we are still Muslims?' He replied, 'Yes, while you are still Muslims.' I asked, 'Then what happens?' He replied, 'Then it will be rebuilt better than it ever was. When you see Mecca with its valleys dug through (canals or tunnels<span style="font-size: 1rem;">), </span>and<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> construction (buildings/houses) rising above the tops of the mountains</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, know that the matter (a significant event or the Day of Judgment) is looming over you.'"</span></p>

<blockquote>In the year 809 CE (193 AH), Zubaidah (the wealthy wife of the 5th Abbasid Caliph)  went on her fifth Hajj. That year there had been a drought in Makkah and she witnessed the devastating effect on the local population and the pilgrims. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Saddened by the situation she immediately called for a solution. Engineers and experts from different regions were employed to resolve the crisis. They proposed the building of a canal from the spring of Hunain which was 95km to the east. However, it wasn’t possible to build a canal on the surface because of the rocky and barren land. Instead, engineers chose to build an aqueduct which channeled water through a tunnel and provided it at different intervals where required.</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Really <span style="color: #ff0000;">UNFORTUNATE </span>that Islamists have <span style="color: #ff0000;">DECEIVED </span>millions of innocent people using this prophecy:</strong></h2>
<p>Islamists often resort to dishonesty, and they have a vast propaganda machine to spread their lies and deceptions.</p>
<p>The combination of these two evils has allowed Islamists to mislead and convert innocent people to Islam through this prophecy.</p>
<p>Millions of Muslims harbour doubts about Islam, but Islamists have effectively used this prophecy to reinforce their faith.</p>
<p>The only fortunate aspect is that lies and propaganda can't last forever. Eventually, a time comes when the truth exposes falsehoods.</p>

			<title>All Prophecies of the Last Hour from Muhammad are FALSE</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dear people!</p>
<p>Please use your mind and don't let yourself be deceived by the propaganda of Islamic Preachers. </p>
<p>Please remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 3rd world war is not going to send humans to the Stone Age, but it is going to wipe out the human race.</li>
<li>Atomic and hydrogen weapons are so powerful today, that they have the ability to destroy this whole world several times. </li>
<li>The entire world will become inhabitable for human life for the next thousands of years.  </li>
</ul>
<p>But Muhammad was telling fantasy prophecies that:</p>
<ul>
<li>After an apocalyptic great battle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Malhama_Al-Kubra">Al-Malhama Al-Kubra</a>), Dajjal will appear, and he will go to <strong>all cities</strong> of the world (except Mecca and Medina, where he will not be able to enter). Jews and many others will join his army. </li>
<li>And then Jesus will also appear. And Muslims will still be alive to join his army. And they will kill Dajjal and the Jews. </li>
<li>And then wealth will become abundant, and no one will take Zakat. </li>
<li>And in the last step, the land of Arabia will become meadows and rivers. </li>
</ul>
<p>But these prophecies are false. After the nuclear war, There will be no cities left which could be visited by Dajjal. And no Jews or other people will be left to join Dajjal's army. </p>
<p>Similarly, no Muslims will be left to join the army of Jesus. And no Mecca or Medina will be left. And the whole land of Arabia will be inhabitable for the human race. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>(1) Muhammad's Prophecy: Muslims will be fighting on Horses</h3>
<p>Also, Muhammad says everyone would be fighting on horses instead of using modern stuff such as aeroplanes or nuclear weapons. Just more evidence that Muhammad was making up stories to keep his people interested.</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2899a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sahih Muslim, 2899a</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">... They will, therefore, throw away what would be in their hands and go forward sending ten horsemen, as a scouting party. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">I know their names and the names of their forefathers and the color of their horses. They will be the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day or amongst the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Comments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Any sane person will come only to the conclusion that these prophecies are only fantasy stories, and they are not proving Muhammad to be a true prophet, but they are only proving Muhammad to be a false prophet. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reverse is happening in the practical world. Due to the huge power of <strong>Propaganda &amp; Deception</strong> of Islamic preachers, millions of simple Muslims are becoming more steadfast in their belief in Allah/Muhammad, and thousands of non-Muslims are accepting Islam in the name of the so-called true prophecies of Muhammad.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>(2) The prophecy of the land of Arabia becoming meadows and river</h3>
<p>Muslim preachers are today doing non-stop propaganda that the land of Arabia is becoming green after a few rainfalls. But this prophecy is false. </p>
<p>The SEQUENCE of events according to the Hadith is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, there will be an apocalyptic great battle known as Al-Malhama Al-Kubra, which in today's context means a global nuclear war.</li>
<li>Next, Jesus will appear, ushering in an era of long-term reign during which wealth will become abundant.</li>
<li>And the land of Arabia will turn into meadows and rivers only in that era of Jesus.  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:157c">Sahih Muslim, 157c</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying: The Last Hour will not come before wealth becomes abundant and overflowing, so much so that a man takes Zakat out of his property and cannot find anyone to accept it from him and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>till the land of Arabia becomes meadows and rivers</strong></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>And this abundance of wealth will take place during the reign of Jesus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2476">Bukhari, 2476</a>:</p>
<p>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizya tax. Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it (as charitable gifts).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can Islamic preachers directly go to the stage of the land of Arabia becoming meadows, while still neither a great battle has taken place, nor Jesus has come, nor wealth has become abundant?</p>
<p>In the case of nuclear war, all the green spots (which are present today in Saudi Arabia due to wheather change and some rainfall) are going to vanish. And Saudi Arabia is going to become inhabitable for the next thousands of years. </p>
<p>Moreover, see this (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CritiqueIslam/comments/1db25w8/the_prophecy_of_the_greening_of_arabia_is_also/">link</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recent research shows that overall, aridity is increasing throughout the Middle East, including in<span> </span><em>most parts</em><span> </span>of Saudi Arabia. Only one area of Eastern Saudi Arabia is getting comparatively more rainfall compared to previous years and this is not near Mecca/Medina (see Fig 9 -<span> </span><a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a

</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that many regions of Saudi Arabia are getting less rainfall is such that it is actually threatening biodiversity of plants there (<a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a

</li>
<li>
<p>A study done in Saudi Arabia recommends “the necessity of activating water-harvesting projects to make the most of varying rainfall rates, rationalize water consumption”. This is hardly consistent with an abundance of meadows and rivers. (<a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a

</li>
</ul>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Present-day Muslims have also done some Tehrif (Distortion) in translating this Hadith. They translated the word <span>تَعُودَ as "revert" (i.e. ... </span>till the land of Arabia <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>REVERTS</strong></span> meadows and rivers). By changing this translation, they want to prove a Prophetic Miracle, i.e. modern science showed that the land or Arabia was green several thousand years ago and nobody knew about it. Thus, they claim that it was a miracle of the Prophet and he know about the past state of Arabia through revelation). </p>
<p>However, this prophetic miracle claim is false, while the word <span>تَعُودَ is also used in sense of "becoming" somthing, even if it was not in that state prior.</span><span> Lane's gives the example of "وَدِدْتُ أَنَّ هٰذَا اللَّبَنَ يَعُودُ قَطِرَانًا" which means "I wish that this milk would become tar", which certainly doesn't mean the milk used to be tar. </span></p>
<p>As far as proof of Distortion by present-day Muslims is concerned, then please read the details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210321191244/https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/m60dpl/you_guys_should_know_that_the_hadith_website/">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>(3) Debunking the Euphrates River Hadith</h3>
<p>Another favourite of Islamic preachers is the hadith of the Euphrates River, through which they are deceiving millions of innocent people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2894a">Sahih Muslim, 2894a</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: </strong>The Last Hour would not come before the Euphrates uncovers a mountain of gold, for which people would fight. Ninety-nine out of each one hundred would die but every man amongst them would say that perhaps he would be the one who would be saved (and thus possess this gold).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In another hadith, it has been made clear that 99 out of 100 deaths will take place after the Great Battle (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2899a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sahih Muslim, 2899a</a>). So, do you think that gold will have any value after the Great Nuclear War?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And no mountains of gold have been found in the Euphrates river, but only a small amount. And no one is fighting over it, but companies are extracting it peacefully. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h3 align="left">(4) Buttocks of the Women of Dhi-al-Khalasaa </h3>
<p class="western" align="left">Here is the prophecy: </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western" align="left"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7116">Sahih Bukhari, 7116</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western"><em>Allah's Messenger said, "The Hour will not be established till the </em><em>buttocks of the women of the</em><em> </em><em><strong>tribe of Daus</strong></em><em> </em><em>move while going round (the statue of) </em><em>Dhi-al-Khalasa</em><em>."</em></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response</strong></span>: </p>
<p>Why would a prophet talk about the <strong>buttocks</strong> of women? In one hadith, Muhammad mentioned "flags in buttocks" [<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1738a">Sahih Muslim 1738a</a>]. Couldn't he just have said that the end times would come when women began to circle around the statue of Dhi-al-Khalasa? Does such language befit a prophet of a divine religion?</p>
<p>Furthermore, this prophecy has proven to be false, as the statue of Dhi-al-Khalasa no longer exists and is not worshiped by anyone. This also implies that if one prophecy in the Hadith is false, none of the other prophecies can be trusted.</p>
<p>However, Islamic Apologists came up with the following proofs, and claimed that the prophecy is indeed true (<a href="https://en.rattibha.com/thread/1772401560099737618">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Historian in his work “Akhbār Makkah” witness, In the 1800s, Daws tribe began worshiping and sacrificing to ḏūl ḵhalaṣa, a building with walls and a tree When King ʿAbdul ʿAzīz took control of the Ḥijāz area, he sent military campaign in 1925 to demolish the idol. </p>
<p>Multiple other contemporary Historians witnessed the worshiping of ḏūl ḵhalaṣa including:</p>
<p>(1) Uṯhmān ibn Bishr (1780 - 1871 AD)in his ʿUnwān al-Majd fī Taʾrīkh Najd.</p>
<p>(2) Fawzān al-Sābiq (1859 - 1954 AD) in “al-Bayān wa-al-Ishhār li-kashf zaygh al-mulḥid al-Ḥājj Mukhtār”.</p>
<p>(3) Muḥammad ibn Balīhad An-Najdī (1893 - 1957 AD) in his commentary on Kitāb Ṣifat Jazīratul ʿArab. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">(5) Even the non-Muslim Historian writes it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And here a video the remains of Dhi-al-Khalasa. </span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Our Response:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Regrettably, Islamists are employing deceptive tactics. The so-called evidence cited is entirely fabricated.</p>
<p><span class="x1lliihq x1plvlek xryxfnj x1n2onr6 x193iq5w xeuugli x1fj9vlw x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1s928wv xhkezso x1gmr53x x1cpjm7i x1fgarty x1943h6x xt4736n x1havqas x1f0sm9e x12qp5cl xzsf02u x1yc453h xudqn12 x3x7a5m">Islamists claimed above that the book "Akhbar Mecca, pp. 381" states: <em>"When King Abd Al Azeez took control of the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hijaz </strong></span>area, he sent military campaigns to subdue tribes and bring them under his control. A campaign was sent to the mountains of Daws in 1925."</em></span></p>
<p><span class="x1lliihq x1plvlek xryxfnj x1n2onr6 x193iq5w xeuugli x1fj9vlw x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1s928wv xhkezso x1gmr53x x1cpjm7i x1fgarty x1943h6x xt4736n x1havqas x1f0sm9e x12qp5cl xzsf02u x1yc453h xudqn12 x3x7a5m">However, there is a significant problem with this claim. </span>The issue is that the Kaba of Dhi-al-Khalasa was not located in the Hijaz area but in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Yemen</strong></span>, a region that was never under the control of King Abd al-Aziz. This factual discrepancy undermines the credibility of the entire claim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4357">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4357</a>:<br>Dhul-l--Khulasa was a house in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Yemen </strong></span>belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka`ba." <strong>Jarir went there, <span style="color: #ff0000;">burnt </span>it with fire and <span style="color: #ff0000;">dismantled </span>it</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, according to the video, this alleged ruin is present in "<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tabalah+Saudi+Arabia/@23.4645774,41.988021,5.48z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x15efb883dbd3efa9:0x6527776b12604571!8m2!3d19.9969372!4d42.2263783!16s%2Fg%2F1x6n4j_w?entry=ttu">Tabalah (Saudi Arabia)</a>", and google maps show that this place is at least 400 km away from the closest border of Yemen. </p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Sahih Bukhari, Jarir, a companion of Prophet Muhammad, set the building ablaze. However, the video shows images of animals etched into the stones, inconsistent with the claim that the structure was burned and dismantled. It's essential to note that numerous pre-Islamic ruins with inscriptions exist throughout the Arabian region, such as the <span class="mw-page-title-main"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir_Hima_Rock_Petroglyphs_and_Inscriptions">Bir Hima Rock Inscriptions</a></span> in Saudi Arabia, featuring similar animal images on stones.</p>
<p>Additionally, why do these images depict animals rather than the supposed statue of Dhi-al-Khalasa?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if this site in Yemen were indeed a major place of pilgrimage, akin to a Kaaba, it would need to support large numbers of visitors. Yet, the small, fragmented remains on top of the hill indicate that the site wasn't designed to handle significant crowds—not even hundreds, let alone thousands. The absence of "flat land" on the hilltop raises doubts about its capacity to host large gatherings. This raises questions about the credibility of claims that it served as a major religious site.</p>
<p>Additionally, if Jarir dismantled the site and then King Abdul Aziz reportedly dismantled it again, how is it possible that remnants of the walls, along with these animal images, are still intact?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Islamic apologists fabricate numerous lies and successfully disseminate them through propaganda, leading millions of innocent people to believe in such prophecies and convert to Islam.</p>

<h3 align="left">(5) Fifty women for one man</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #22262a;"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:81">Sahih Bukhari, 81</a>:</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western"><em>Allah's Messenger said: From among the portents of the Hour are (the following): ... Women will increase in number and men will decrease in number so much so that<span style="color: #ff0000;"> fifty women </span>will be looked after by <span style="color: #0000ff;">one man</span>.</em></blockquote>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comments: </span></strong></p>
<p class="western">Science has already defeated Muhammad. Science has already advanced to that stage where it is fully in a position to avoid any such imbalance of 1 man to 50 women.

<h3>(6) When a slave girl gives birth to her master</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="western"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:50">Sahih Bukhari, 50</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">(Allah’s Messenger said: The hour will come) When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.</blockquote>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comments:</span></strong></p>
<p class="western">But the non-religious Western people already defeated Allah and his Qiyyamah, while they all together abolished slavery. Thus, there is no slave woman left to give birth to her master.</p>
<p>An<span style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 400;"> apologist came up with this excuse:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This hadith means that mothers will give birth to children that will enslave them. Like, children being so spoiled to the point they are treating their parents as slaves. Basically, a downfall of morality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A lame excuse, while Muhammad could have simply told it in normal words that a mother (either a slave or a free Woman) would give birth to a child, who would act like a master to her.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That is why none of the Muslims of the last 1400 years ever came up with this meaning of this Hadith, and kept it to slave mothers only, and not to the free Muslim women and their children. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(7) The last hour would come when a young boy in Muhammad's company would die</h3>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>Drawing from the successful strategies employed by Judaism and Christianity, which utilized the concept of the Dajjal and the last hour to instil fear in their followers, Muhammad adopted similar tactics. By invoking the idea of the Dajjal and the last hour, he aimed to ensure the unwavering loyalty of his own followers and prevent any thoughts of disloyalty.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one of his prophecies about the last hour was exposed shortly after his death. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2953b">Sahih Muslim, 2953b</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Anas b. Malik reported that a person asked Allah's Apostle (ﷺ): <span style="font-size: 1rem;">When would the Last Hour come? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) kept quiet for a while. Then looked at a <strong>young boy</strong> in his presence belonging to the tribe of Azd Shanu'a and he said: <strong>If this boy lives he would not grow very old till the Last Hour would come <span style="color: #ff0000;">to you</span></strong>. Anas said that this young boy was of our age during those days.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Muhammad conveyed numerous accounts of the end times to his followers, yet deliberately kept all signs VAGUE and refrained from providing explicit details or specific timelines. But <span style="font-size: 1rem;">he was only a human and he indeed made a mistake in this case</span>, rendering the prophecy time-bound.</p>
<p>Muhammad's companions and later coming Muslim generations also feared the last hour. As a result, this particular forecast gained widespread attention. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">However, soon that young boy (who was mentioned in the Hadith) became old and died too,</span> and the anticipated event of the last hour did not transpire.</p>
<p>In response, followers of Muhammad attempted to justify their leader's error by altering the interpretation of the hadith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6511">Sahih Bukhari, 6511</a>:</span></p>

He would look at the youngest of all of them and say, "If this should live till he is very old, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>your </strong></span>Hour will take place." <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Hisham </strong></span>(a sub-narrator) said that he meant (by the Hour), their death (i.e. the death of bedouins who asked this question).</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisham_ibn_Urwah">Hisham,</a> the sub-narrator of this hadith, was born 51 years after the demise of Muhammad. It is logical to assume that he outlived the young boy whose advanced age Muhammad referenced as a sign of the approaching final hour in this account.</p>
<p>Given the fact that numerous individuals from Hisham's era would have harbored doubts about Muhammad's prophetic abilities due to this unfulfilled prophecy, it becomes evident that Hisham felt compelled to offer a defense against these criticisms by modifying the narrative.</p>
<p>Moreover, a careful examination of the context in which this hadith was recorded reveals that Hisham's attempt at clarification appears weak and unconvincing. It is reasonable to presume that anyone would be aware of the fact that they will surely pass away before the youngest member of their group reaches old age. Consequently, it seems superfluous for them to pose such an obvious query to Muhammad, and for him to bother responding with information that was already common knowledge.</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Along with the last hour, Muhammad also extensively used the stories about Dajjal to instil fear among his followers, so that they remain faithful to him. Please read our article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/19-saf-ibn-sayyad-an-equally-important-incident-as-the-satanic-verses">Saf ibn Sayyad (An Equally Important Incident as the Satanic Verses).</a></p>
</div>
<p>Moreover, there is <strong>TEHRIF (Distortion) present in the English translation. </strong></p>
<p>Islamists translate it to: "... the Last Hour would come <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to you</strong></span>".</p>
<p>But there is no "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to you</strong></span>" present in the original Arabic, and it is only a deceptive TEHRIF by Islamists.</p>
<p>Muhammad's way of scaring and keeping his followers in line was to say that judgment day was always around the corner. This is standard practice for cult leaders to introduce a fear that is always coming soon. </p>
<p>See also these hadith below which have Muhammad believing the end was near;</p>

<h2>If just one prophecy is incorrect, then it invalidates the entirety of Islam and the remaining 99.99% of prophecies</h2>
<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>Islamic apologists often waste your time by presenting dozens of ambiguous prophecies one after another. They attempt to mislead you by suggesting that these vague predictions contain hidden wisdom or meaning.</p>
<p>To avoid being drawn into this time-consuming trap, use this strategy:</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> If a single prophecy is proven wrong, it undermines the entire foundation of Islam.</p>
<p>Islamic proponents claim that their god, Allah, is infallible, meaning that every prophecy must be accurate. Ask them to address the prophecy about the Last Hour that has been proven false. They will likely evade the question and bombard you with other vague prophecies to distract and confuse you. Don't let them get away with it—hold them accountable, and don't waste your valuable time with their diversions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A LIST of all prophecies in the Quran and the Hadith</h2>
<p>While it's generally a waste of time, if you're interested, you can find a list of numerous prophecies along with brief refutations in these WikiIslam articles:</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>When the magnetic poles reverse, the "geographical" poles do not change. This means that even after the magnetic poles have switched, the sun will continue to rise in Japan, then move to India, then to the Arab regions, and finally to Europe. It will not start rising in Europe first, then move to India, and finally appear in Japan.<span></span></p>
<p class="first:mt-0 last:mb-0" dir="ltr"><span>In more simpler words, the sun will not start to rise from the WEST even after reversal of magnetic poles. </span></p>
<p class="first:mt-0 last:mb-0" dir="ltr"><span>Moreover, there will occur <strong>no </strong></span><strong>catastrophic events on Earth</strong> due to the reversal of magnetic poles. </p>
<p class="first:mt-0 last:mb-0" dir="ltr"><span></span></p>
<h2>Details:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4636">Sahih Bukhari, 4636</a>:</p>
<p><span class="arabic_sanad arabic">قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏</span><span> </span><span class="arabic_text_details arabic">"‏ لاَ تَقُومُ </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>السَّاعَةُ</strong></span><span class="arabic_text_details arabic"> حَتَّى تَطْلُعَ الشَّمْسُ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا فَإِذَا طَلَعَتْ وَرَآهَا النَّاسُ آمَنُوا أَجْمَعُونَ، وَذَلِكَ حِينَ لاَ يَنْفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا ‏"</span><span class="arabic_sanad arabic">‏‏.‏ ثُمَّ قَرَأَ الآيَةَ‏.‏</span></p>
<p>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">hour</span></strong> will not be established <strong>till the sun rises from the West</strong>; and when it rises (from the West) and the people see it, they all will believe. And that is (the time) when no good will it do to a soul to believe then." Then he recited the whole Verse (6.158)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, Islamic preachers try to confirm this prophetic tradition scientifically, by using the phenomenon of "magnetic pole reversal” of the earth. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the truth is, the sun will still not rise from the geographical west, despite the reversal of earth's poles.</p>
<h2>The reversal of magnetic poles does not cause the reversal of "geographical poles," nor does it bring about any catastrophic events on Earth</h2>
<p>The reversal of the Earth's magnetic poles does not involve the geographical poles changing places. The magnetic poles and geographical poles are distinct concepts. Here’s a detailed explanation:</p>
<h3>Geographical Poles</h3>
<p>The geographical poles (North and South Poles) are fixed points on the Earth's surface where the planet's axis of rotation intersects the surface. These poles are defined by the Earth's rotational axis and remain relatively stable over time, apart from slight movements due to the planet's wobble.</p>
<h3>Magnetic Poles</h3>
<p>The Earth's magnetic poles are the points on the Earth's surface where the planet's magnetic field lines are vertical. These poles are influenced by the movements of molten iron and nickel in the Earth's outer core, which generate the planet's magnetic field.</p>
<h3>Magnetic Pole Reversal</h3>
<p>A magnetic pole reversal occurs when the Earth's magnetic field gradually changes direction such that the magnetic north pole becomes the magnetic south pole and vice versa. This process involves changes in the flow of molten iron within the Earth's outer core, which alters the planet's magnetic field. Magnetic pole reversals are a natural part of Earth's geologic history and have occurred many times over millions of years.</p>
<h3>Impact on Geographical Poles</h3>
<p>The geographical poles remain unchanged during a magnetic pole reversal. The Earth will continue to rotate around the same axis, and the North and South Poles will stay in their current locations. The only change is in the direction of the magnetic field, not the planet’s physical rotation or its axis.</p>
<h3>Potential Destruction During Magnetic Pole Change</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Magnetic Field Weakening</strong>: During a magnetic pole reversal, the Earth's magnetic field may weaken temporarily. This could result in an increased influx of cosmic and solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, potentially affecting satellite operations, communication systems, and power grids.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Radiation</strong>: With a weaker magnetic field, more charged particles from the sun (solar wind) could penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, potentially increasing radiation levels. This could have implications for high-altitude aviation and astronauts.</li>
<li><strong>No Catastrophic Changes</strong>: Despite these potential effects, there is no evidence to suggest that a magnetic pole reversal would cause catastrophic destruction on Earth. Life on Earth has survived numerous past reversals without evidence of mass extinctions or severe environmental changes directly attributable to magnetic reversals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, during a magnetic pole reversal, only the magnetic field of the Earth changes direction. The geographical poles, which are defined by the Earth’s axis of rotation, remain fixed. While there may be some temporary disruptions and increased radiation levels during a magnetic reversal, there is no indication that such an event would lead to catastrophic destruction on Earth.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">PS:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">According to Islam, the last hour means when the mountains will be flying in the air like wool. (<a href="https://quran.com/101?startingVerse=4">Surah al-Qar’iah Ayaat 1-5</a>). But the reversal of magnetic poles will not cause any such destruction of mountains. </p>

			<title>The False Prophecy of the Buttocks of the Women of Dhi-al-Khalasaa </title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/last-hour-prophecies/308-the-false-prophecy-of-the-buttocks-of-the-women-of-dhi-al-khalasaa</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="western" align="left">Here is the prophecy: </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western" align="left"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7116">Sahih Bukhari, 7116</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western"><em>Allah's Messenger said, "The Hour will not be established till the </em><em>buttocks of the women of the</em><em> </em><em><strong>tribe of Daus</strong></em><em> </em><em>move while going round (the statue of) </em><em>Dhi-al-Khalasa</em><em>."</em></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response</strong></span>: </p>
<p>Why would a prophet talk about the <strong>buttocks</strong> of women? In one hadith, Muhammad mentioned "flags in buttocks" [<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1738a">Sahih Muslim 1738a</a>]. Couldn't he just have said that the end times would come when women began to circle around the statue of Dhi-al-Khalasa? Does such language befit a prophet of a divine religion?</p>
<p>Furthermore, this prophecy has proven to be false, as the statue of Dhi-al-Khalasa no longer exists and is not worshiped by anyone. This also implies that if one prophecy in the Hadith is false, none of the other prophecies can be trusted.</p>
<p>However, Islamic Apologists came up with the following proofs, and claimed that the prophecy is indeed true (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401599282909442">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Historian in his work “Akhbār Makkah” witness, In the 1800s, Daws tribe began worshiping and sacrificing to ḏūl ḵhalaṣa, a building with walls and a tree When King ʿAbdul ʿAzīz took control of the Ḥijāz area, he sent military campaign in 1925 to demolish the idol (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401571759800692">source</a>). </p>
<p>Multiple other contemporary Historians witnessed the worshiping of ḏūl ḵhalaṣa including:</p>
<p>(1) Uṯhmān ibn Bishr (1780 - 1871 AD)in his ʿUnwān al-Majd fī Taʾrīkh Najd (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401579108282647">source</a>)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">(5) Even the non-Muslim Historian writes it (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401599282909442">source</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And here a video the remains of Dhi-al-Khalasa. </span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Our Response:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Regrettably, Islamists are employing deceptive tactics. The so-called evidence cited is entirely fabricated.</p>
<p><span class="x1lliihq x1plvlek xryxfnj x1n2onr6 x193iq5w xeuugli x1fj9vlw x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1s928wv xhkezso x1gmr53x x1cpjm7i x1fgarty x1943h6x xt4736n x1havqas x1f0sm9e x12qp5cl xzsf02u x1yc453h xudqn12 x3x7a5m">Islamists claimed above that the book "Akhbar Mecca, pp. 381" states: <em>"When King Abd Al Azeez took control of the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hijaz </strong></span>area, he sent military campaigns to subdue tribes and bring them under his control. A campaign was sent to the mountains of Daws in 1925."</em></span></p>
<p><span class="x1lliihq x1plvlek xryxfnj x1n2onr6 x193iq5w xeuugli x1fj9vlw x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1s928wv xhkezso x1gmr53x x1cpjm7i x1fgarty x1943h6x xt4736n x1havqas x1f0sm9e x12qp5cl xzsf02u x1yc453h xudqn12 x3x7a5m">However, there is a significant problem with this claim. </span>The issue is that the Kaba of Dhi-al-Khalasa was not located in the Hijaz area but in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Yemen</strong></span>, a region that was never under the control of King Abd al-Aziz. This factual discrepancy undermines the credibility of the entire claim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4357">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4357</a>:<br>Dhul-l--Khulasa was a house in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Yemen </strong></span>belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka`ba." <strong>Jarir went there, <span style="color: #ff0000;">burnt </span>it with fire and <span style="color: #ff0000;">dismantled </span>it</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, according to the video, this alleged ruin is present in "<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tabalah+Saudi+Arabia/@23.4645774,41.988021,5.48z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x15efb883dbd3efa9:0x6527776b12604571!8m2!3d19.9969372!4d42.2263783!16s%2Fg%2F1x6n4j_w?entry=ttu">Tabalah (Saudi Arabia)</a>", and google maps show that this place is at least 400 km away from the closest border of Yemen. </p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Sahih Bukhari, Jarir, a companion of Prophet Muhammad, set the building ablaze. However, the video shows images of animals etched into the stones, inconsistent with the claim that the structure was burned and dismantled. It's essential to note that numerous pre-Islamic ruins with inscriptions exist throughout the Arabian region, such as the <span class="mw-page-title-main"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir_Hima_Rock_Petroglyphs_and_Inscriptions">Bir Hima Rock Inscriptions</a></span> in Saudi Arabia, featuring similar animal images on stones.</p>
<p>Additionally, why do these images depict animals rather than the supposed statue of Dhi-al-Khalasa?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if this site in Yemen were indeed a major place of pilgrimage, akin to a Kaaba, it would need to support large numbers of visitors. Yet, the small, fragmented remains on top of the hill indicate that the site wasn't designed to handle significant crowds—not even hundreds, let alone thousands. The absence of "flat land" on the hilltop raises doubts about its capacity to host large gatherings. This raises questions about the credibility of claims that it served as a major religious site.</p>
<p>Additionally, if Jarir dismantled the site and then King Abdul Aziz reportedly dismantled it again, how is it possible that remnants of the walls, along with these animal images, are still intact?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Islamic apologists fabricate numerous lies and successfully disseminate them through propaganda, leading millions of innocent people to believe in such prophecies and convert to Islam.</p>]]></description>

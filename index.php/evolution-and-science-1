			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/sewia50cu8s811.jpg" alt="When a Bulb could not come into being automatically, how then whole universe came into being automatically?" width="640" height="782" loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/sewia50cu8s811.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>The question posed above raises an interesting point, but it's based on a false premise. It assumes that the creation of a light bulb and the origins of the universe are comparable events, which they are not.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Let's examine the formation and destruction of thousands of stars, some even larger than Earth, that occur daily. There is no purpose behind this formation and destruction which has been happening for the last 14.8 billion years. <em><strong>This happens only when the Design is not INTELLIGENT, but RANDOM.</strong></em></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Similarly, consider the death and extinction of billions of species that occurred before the arrival of modern humans. The vast majority of these species came into existence and vanished without any discernible purpose. Again, this happens only when the Design is not INTELLIGENT, but RANDOM.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And now look at a mobile phone. You will not see even a SINGLE spare part there which is useless and has no function. This is known as Intelligent Design.</p>
<p>Moreover, as PB Shelley aptly pointed out, "Design must be proved before a designer is inferred." Simply put, just because something exhibits aesthetic appeal or serves a practical purpose, it doesn't necessarily imply the presence of a designer. Random, undirected natural processes can generate complex structures and patterns, such as those found in Conway's Game of Life.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that the argument "everything has a creator" is problematic. If we apply this reasoning consistently, we should acknowledge that Allah, too, must have had a creator. However, this line of thinking leads to infinite regression and raises questions about who created the creator's creator, ad infinitum. Alternatively, one could propose the existence of multiple deities or advanced extraterrestrial civilizations as potential creators.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the comparison between the creation of a light bulb and the origins of the universe is unfounded. Natural processes, rather than intelligent design, govern the formation and evolution of celestial bodies and life forms. Before jumping to conclusions about a designer, we must first establish evidence of design. Aesthetic appeal and functional purposes alone are insufficient grounds for inference. By embracing critical thought and exploring various perspectives, we can deepen our understanding of the world around us.</p>

			<title>Objection: A Mobile Phone has a Creator but Humans do not?</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/evolution-and-science/243-objection-a-mobile-phone-has-a-creator-but-humans-do-not</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/evolution-and-science/243-objection-a-mobile-phone-has-a-creator-but-humans-do-not</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Firstly, please differentiate between the concept of "<strong>invention</strong>" and "<strong>creation</strong>". </p>
<p>Secondly, a mobile phone is an "<strong>Intelligent Design</strong>", where not a single part is used without any "<strong>purpose</strong>". </p>
<p>But look at the universe. Many stars (which are even bigger than the Earth) are destroyed and then formed every day. It has been happening for 14.8 billion years. What is the "<strong>purpose</strong>" of all this destruction? Can this destruction without any purpose be called an "<strong>Intelligent Design</strong>"?</p>
<p>Please ponder upon it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Purpose in Natural Phenomena: </strong>The universe is filled with natural processes that seem to lack a clear purpose or intention. For example, the continuous formation and destruction of stars, as well as the extinction of species throughout Earth's history, raises questions about the purpose or intention behind these events. The existence of dinosaurs and the subsequent extinction of various species before modern humans appeared can be seen as examples of natural processes that occurred without a discernible purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inefficiency in Natural Events:</strong> The vastness and complexity of the universe often display inefficiency or seeming randomness. Events like the destruction of billions of stars without a clear reason or purpose can be seen as evidence against an intelligent design. If the universe were intentionally created by a god, one might question why such destructive events occur without apparent purpose or benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolutionary Processes: </strong>The evolutionary history of life on Earth demonstrates a non-directed, natural process. The development and extinction of numerous species over millions of years point to an evolutionary mechanism driven by natural selection rather than a predetermined plan or purpose. This suggests that the diversity of life we observe today is a result of natural processes rather than intentional design.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As PB Shelley once said, "Design must be proved before a designer is inferred."</p>
<p>On one hand, we have a light bulb that we know is designed by humans. On the other hand, we have natural phenomena such as stars, rocks, clouds, and galaxies that arise through natural processes. Are these random objects designed? No religious person, including Muslims, would argue for the design of an unattractive rock, a broken tree, or a random cloud. Why? Because anything that lacks aesthetic appeal or functional purpose appears to lack design. When they observe stars, moons, or spiral galaxies, they perceive design partly due to their aesthetic beauty and functionality. However, as Shelley rightly argues, design must be proven before inferring a designer. They have not even established the design, yet they infer a designer. This is a leap of faith. Aesthetic and functional reasons alone are insufficient to prove design. Conway's Game of Life, for example, starts with simple rules and configurations, yet complex shapes and dynamics emerge over time. These shapes may appear aesthetically pleasing and serve a purpose, but there is no secret design or designer involved.</p>
<p>The logic that "everything has a creator" is flawed. While humans may have creators (our parents), asserting that Allah has no creator while applying the creator argument to everything else is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if we assume that the universe has a creator, it does not automatically prove that the creator is Allah. There is no fault in considering the possibility that other deities, such as Zeus, Odin, or Amaterasu, as believed by people of other religions, could be the creators. In fact, one could even entertain the idea that an advanced alien civilization created the entire universe.</p>
<p><strong>Imperfections and limitations in human evolution: </strong></p>
<p>In the context of discussing imperfections and limitations in human evolution that contradict the notion of intelligent design, here are a few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Human Reproduction: Take a moment to consider the seemingly chaotic nature of human reproduction. How many trillions of sperm cells are wasted by a man throughout his life for the birth of just a few children? Can we truly compare this process to the intelligent design of a mobile phone, where every part serves a specific purpose without any extras? Millions of sperm cells are propelled towards a single egg cell in the hope that one will successfully penetrate it. However, this process often fails. Even if conception occurs, gestation may fail in approximately 15% of cases, resulting in spontaneous abortions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suboptimal design: The human body exhibits several instances of suboptimal design that suggest the absence of an intelligent designer. For instance, the recurrent laryngeal nerve takes a circuitous route from the brain to the larynx, passing through the chest instead of taking a more direct path (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve">Source</a>). This is inefficient and prone to potential complications, but natural selection has no way to correct the problem. Similarly, the human lower back is susceptible to pain and injury due to the structure and arrangement of the spine, which could be considered a design flaw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vestigial structures: Humans possess several vestigial structures—organs or features that have lost or reduced their original function throughout evolution. Examples include the appendix, which appears to have little or no significant purpose in modern humans, and the coccyx (tailbone), a remnant of our evolutionary ancestors' tails. The existence of vestigial structures suggests a history of evolutionary change rather than intentional design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genetic disorders and susceptibility to diseases: Human DNA carries various genetic disorders and predispositions to diseases. If humans were intentionally designed, it would be expected that genetic disorders and vulnerabilities would be minimized or eliminated. However, the presence of genetic diseases and susceptibility to various ailments suggests that our genetic makeup has evolved over time and is subject to random mutations rather than guided by an intelligent design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suboptimal adaptations: Humans possess certain adaptations that may have been suitable for ancestral environments but are less optimal in modern contexts. For example, our upright walking posture, while advantageous for certain purposes, makes humans more susceptible to back problems compared to animals with a more quadrupedal stance. This suggests that human anatomy and adaptations are products of gradual evolutionary change rather than intentional design.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The human body is a mess. It's a miracle that it works at all. If a human designer were to come up with a product as haphazard and slipshod as the human body they would be fired long ago.</p>
<p>It's important to note that these imperfections and limitations do not imply that humans are without value or significance. They are simply indications that the human form and function have evolved over time, influenced by natural selection and other evolutionary processes, rather than being the result of deliberate intelligent design.</p>

			<title>Misusing the Monkey-Typewriter Analogy to Discredit Evolution</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/evolution-and-science/345-infinite-monkey-theorem-against-theory-of-evolution</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/evolution-and-science/345-infinite-monkey-theorem-against-theory-of-evolution</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Islamists present the following argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atheists argue that the universe arose through "chance events," with their entire theory of evolution depending on this "theory of chance." This idea is also supported by the Infinite Monkey Theorem, which suggests that a monkey randomly pressing keys could, over infinite time, type a coherent sentence or part of a book. However, scientists have debunked this notion, showing that even in trillions of years, it is highly unlikely that a monkey would type even a single English word like "bananas." Given the universe's age of only 13.8 billion years, this complexity without intelligent design is deemed improbable <span> (as a monkey will need many trillion years to write a single book)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Response:</span></strong></p>
<p>Religious people often try to disprove the theory of evolution by using the "monkey and typewriter" analogy (The Infinite Monkey Theorem), which reflects a misunderstanding of "<strong>random occurring mutations</strong>" and "<strong>natural selection</strong>."</p>
<p>Let's break this down:</p>
<p><strong>1. Misunderstanding Evolution</strong>:</p>
<p>Evolution is not entirely random. Although genetic mutations can occur randomly,<strong> "natural selection" provides <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">direction</span></strong>. Beneficial mutations tend to persist, as they enhance survival or reproduction. Over time, this leads to increasingly complex and well-adapted organisms. The "monkey and typewriter" example ignores this key point, inaccurately representing evolution as purely random.</p>
<p><strong>2. Natural Selection</strong>:</p>
<p>Imagine a population of rabbits in a dense, earthy-colored forest. Some rabbits are brown, while others are white. Brown rabbits blend into the environment better, making them less visible to predators. As a result, more brown rabbits survive and reproduce, while white rabbits become easy prey. Over time, brown rabbits dominate due to their advantage, showcasing natural selection.</p>
<p><strong>3. Incremental Selection</strong>:</p>
<p>If a monkey typing randomly could retain each correct letter for "banana," only needing to adjust other letters, it would resemble natural selection, where successful changes are retained <strong><span style="color: rgb(32, 0, 255);">[For example, if the monkey randomly types "b", then it is retained, and in the next step, the monkey only has to adjust other letters]</span></strong>. Richard Dawkins illustrated this concept through his "Weasel" program, showing how random processes guided by selection can achieve complex outcomes efficiently (see Dawkins' <em>The Blind Watchmaker</em> or his Weasel program)<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Misuse of Probability/Chance:</strong></p>
<p>Arguments against evolution often exaggerate probabilities to make evolution seem impossible. However, evolution is gradual, with natural selection guiding beneficial changes after life began, not a single instant of complex creation.</p>
<p><strong>5. Evidence:</strong></p>
<p>Fossil records, genetic research, and observable nature support evolution, showing how organisms adapt to their environment over generations. Features like the human appendix and genetic similarities indicate evolutionary progress, pointing to common ancestry, not intelligent design.</p>
<p><strong>6. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The "monkey and typewriter" argument against complexity forming by chance misrepresents the nature of evolution, which is a combination of random genetic changes and guided natural selection. Complexity developing over billions of years is not only possible but highly likely.</p>
<p><strong>7. Evolution in Bacteria and Viruses in Record Time</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Infinite Monkey Theorem</em> is disproven by understanding mutations and natural selection in viruses and bacteria. While mutations occur randomly, natural selection picks beneficial changes that aid survival.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Example with Influenza Virus</strong>: Random mutations occur, but only those helping the virus evade vaccines persist. Unlike the <em>Infinite Monkey Theorem</em>, natural selection chooses advantageous changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Antibiotic Resistance</strong>: Mutations in bacteria are selected to resist antibiotics, producing a more resilient version of bacteria.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, complexity and adaptation in life (e.g., viruses and bacteria) result from the combined effects of mutation and natural selection, not mere randomness.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PS:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>At least we know that monkeys exist, can't say the same for their delusional, faith based, imaginary, unseeing, unknowing, uncaring, man made, narcissistic gods. </span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Muslims assert that the modern non-religious Western world has allegedly burdened and caused misery for women by granting them "<strong>Equal Rights</strong>" akin to men.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They further claim that Islam does not grant "Equal Rights" to women but instead provides them rights based on the principle of "<strong>Justice</strong>."</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, these Islamic apologists are totally wrong. Islam neither gave equal rights to women nor provided them rights on the principles of justice. </p>
<p>Did you know that:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/101771/if-she-accuses-her-husband-of-zina-does-she-have-the-right-to-separate-from-him-by-means-of-liaan">Liaan</a> is considered a 'RIGHT' for men to accuse their wives of adultery without the need for four witnesses.</li>
<li>Even if they personally haven't witnessed any wrongdoing by their wives, they are still allowed to accuse them of engaging in illicit relationships based solely on their suspicions.</li>
<li>Through Li'aan, unscrupulous men gain the power and freedom to tarnish the reputation of their innocent wives. It becomes a tool in the hands of distrustful, jealous husbands to make their wives' lives miserable and even use it as a means of blackmailing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the opposite is not allowed in Islamic Sharia, i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islam does not give the right of Li'aan to women.</li>
<li>This means that even if wives personally witness their husbands engaging in ZINA (fornication) with other women, or even if they witness their husbands committing rape, they are not allowed to accuse their husbands in any Islamic court.</li>
<li>Even if wives have seen their husband<span style="color: #e67e23;"> <strong>raping</strong> their own minor daughters (or even grown-up daughters), still they cannot accuse their husbands of rape</span>.</li>
<li>Or even if they have seen their husbands raping any male child (which happens very often in the Quran Schools in Pakistan), or just having a sexual relationship with any other male, still neither can they go against their husbands in Islamic courts, nor separate themselves from such evil husbands through a divorce.</li>
<li>If the wives still dare to accuse their husbands of fornication/rape in an Islamic court, they must produce four eyewitnesses for their claim. </li>
<li>However, the wives themselves cannot be among those four eyewitnesses; only male witnesses are considered valid. The testimony of women is not accepted in cases of fornication in Islamic Sharia. It is not considered 'half' testimony; rather, it is entirely disregarded. You can find more information on this issue in our detailed article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-general/122-women-s-testimony-is-not-even-half-but-zero-in-serious-hudud-cases">The Testimony of a Woman Is Not Accepted (Not Even as Half) in Serious Hudud Cases such as Rape, Robbery, Murder, etc.</a></li>
<li>If the wife cannot bring four male witnesses to the court, she will face 80 lashes for Qadhf, which means wrongfully accusing her husband, even if she is telling the truth (<a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-general/122-the-testimony-of-a-woman-is-not-accepted-not-even-as-half-in-serious-hudud-cases-such-as-rape,-robbery,-murder,-etc">link</a>).</li>
<li>Wives are placed in a vulnerable position in Islam. They cannot take their husbands to court over accusations of adultery/rape, nor can they obtain freedom from such husbands through divorce (please refer to our article about <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/33-no-khul-خلع-for-a-woman-without-the-husband-s-consent">Khul’ خلع</a>). Even Khul' is not a right granted to women in Islam; it remains at the discretion of the husband, and he may deny it to his wife. In Islam, there are no viable options available for women to separate themselves from such husbands who engage in evil actions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the prominent Islamic Fatwa websites, Islamweb.net writes (</span><a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/428203/liaan-is-not-applicable-from-a-wife-against-her-husband"><span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Li‘aan Is Not Applicable from a wife against her Husband:</strong><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li‘aan is only applicable when a man accuses his wife of committing Zina and she denies it, but when a woman slanders her husband, this does not, on its own, warrant Li‘aan (as Li’aan is only reserved for the men) … "If a woman accuses her husband of committing Zina, she would be liable for the Hadd of slander (i.e. 80 lashes)."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another one of the prominent Saudi Salafi Fatwa websites is “<em>Islam Question Answers</em>”. It writes (</span><a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/101771/if-she-accuses-her-husband-of-zina-does-she-have-the-right-to-separate-from-him-by-means-of-liaan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the wife, if she accuses her husband of zina (i.e. adultery),<span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong> but she cannot produce four witnesses, then she should be given the hadd punishment for slander … If a woman slanders her husband, she should be given the <em>Hadd</em> punishment (of 80 lashes)</strong></span>, .. If a woman knows that her husband has committed zina but she has no proof, namely four witnesses, then she should (only) advise him and remind him, and tell him to fear Allaah.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, this Saudi Mufti is telling women they should not go to courts, but <strong>LIMIT</strong> themselves <strong>ONLY</strong> to advise their husbands. </span></p>
<h2>The Origin of the Drama of Li'aan</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no Allah present in heaven, and it was Muhammad himself who was making the revelations in the name of Allah. This has led to the presence of "human mistakes" in these revelations, unlike true divine revelations, which should be perfect from the outset. The notion of Li'aan also reflects this human error and the "trial and error method."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) stated that in the case of an accusation of adultery, four eyewitnesses were required who had personally seen the act of penetration. Failure to produce these four witnesses would result in all the witnesses being lashed with 80 stripes for making false accusations, even if they were telling the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common sense dictates that punishing witnesses with 80 stripes for telling the truth is contrary to justice. This ruling was seemingly made by Muhammad during the incident of IFK, where he wanted to punish the men who testified against his wife, 'Aisha. There he first made this new rule if the number of witnesses is less than 4, then they should be lashed 80 times (even if they are telling the Truth).  Please refer to our detailed article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/26-ifk-the-huge-clash-between-the-quran-muhammad-s-actions">The incident of Ifk and the Ruling of 4 Witnesses.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the problem arose when the Sahaba (i.e. male companions of Muhammad) found their wives engaging in sexual activities with other men. They accused their wives of adultery without presenting four male eyewitnesses.</span></p>
<p>This situation became a significant problem for Muhammad, as his male Sahaba became extremely angry about the condition of four male eyewitnesses and they refused to accept it, reaching the brink of rebellion. Muhammad needed their support for his wars and didn't want to anger them.</p>
<p>As a result, Muhammad had to introduce a new revelation, abrogating the earlier requirement of four male witnesses for husbands and allowing his male companions to accuse their wives of adultery openly by simply swearing in the name of Allah. However, Muhammad did not grant women the right of Li'aan in his newly revealed verse, <span style="font-size: 1rem;">while the poor women were unable to rebel against him and Islam.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1498c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih Muslim, 1498c</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa'd b. Ubada said: Messenger of Allah, if I were to find with my wife a man, should I not touch him before bringing four witnesses? Allah's Messenger said: Yes. He said: By no means. By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I would hasten with my sword to him before that.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, when Muhammad saw that the male companions were on the verge of rebellion, then he once again played the drama of new revelation, where he gave this “exception” only to the male husbands, to make an accusation of adultery against their wives even without the 4 witnesses, and they will not be lashed 80 times for Qadhf (i.e. the false accusation).</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/24.6?context=3">24:6-7</a>:<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who accuse their wives and do not have any witnesses except themselves, should swear four times in the name of God, the testimony of each such person being that he is speaking the truth, And (swear) a fifth time that if he tells a lie the curse of God be on him.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human intellect clearly guides us, if Allah is really All-Wise, then he would have never put the ridiculous condition of 4 male eyewitnesses (who saw the penis penetrating the vagina clearly) in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the 2nd condition of Qadhf is even more ridiculous than the condition of 4 male eyewitnesses, i.e. even if the wife is telling the truth, but she does not have 4 eyewitnesses, still Islam blames her for telling a lie. This means not only her testimony will be rejected, but she will also be punished brutally for telling the truth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the miseries of such women go beyond that. Other rulings of Islaic Sharia make it impossible for such women to get rid of their evil husbands through divorce, or through Khul', or through any Islamic court. In Islam:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women don't have the right to divorce their husbands.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And it is a big <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">misunderstanding</span> today that <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">Khul</span>' is a woman's right</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">. No, it is not, but Khul' is also a right of a husband in Islamic Sharia. If the husband does not agree with Khul', then no Islamic court can grant freedom to a woman from her husband. Please read our detailed article on this issue: </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/33-no-khul-خلع-for-a-woman-without-the-husband-s-consent">Khul’ خلع (i.e. getting freedom from a husband) is not the “right” of a woman, but it is still the “right” of a husband to either grant it or to deny it</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">. Yes, many modern Islamic States of TODAY do give the right of taking a divorce to women in the name of Khul'. It is a good step, nevertheless, it is not Islamic Sharai, but only a Bid'ah (innovation) in Islamic Sharia. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If the husband is not willing, then no Islamic court has the right to compel him to give divorce to his wife. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muhammad introduced these 2 ridiculous conditions of 4 eyewitnesses and Qadhf in the incident of IFK, in which slander was made against ‘Aisha. Muhammad was extremely angry with those people and wanted to punish them at every cost who accused 'Aisha. Therefore, he also invented the punishment of Qadhf in this same incident, where all the witnesses were lashed 80 times. Please read our <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-general/100-slavery-in-ancient-india">IFK incident </a>for the details. </span></p>
<h2>Excuse from Islamic apologists:</h2>
<p>The only excuse that is given by Islamic apologists for this Islamic injust<span style="font-weight: 400;">ice against women is this:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Islam grants men the right of "Liaan" (accusation of adultery) as a way to disown any illegitimate child born to their wives. In contrast, men cannot become pregnant, and the question of the lineage of a child does not occur in case of men. That is why, Islam does not give the right of Liaan to the wife. <br></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this argument lacks merit, and it does not absolve Islam of its evident double standards. The issue goes beyond merely determining the lineage of a child. If it were solely about that, then a man should also be required to present four witnesses against a woman, who is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOT Pregnant</strong></span></span>, as no issue of the child's lineage occurs in this case. Thus,  failure to provide 4  witnesses in the case of a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>non-pregnant</strong></span> woman should result in similar punishment for him, namely, 80 lashes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Islam allows a husband to accuse his wife of adultery, even if she is not pregnant, putting her in a situation where she could be wrongfully accused despite her innocence. On the other hand, if the husband himself is involved in adultery or rape, the wife is not granted the right to accuse him through Liaan or to separate herself from such a wicked spouse. These double standards persist and cannot be ignored.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2>In the case of Liaan, women face several hardships that men do not have to endure</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first question is, w</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">hat protection did Allah provide to the woman and her child if a man wrongfully accuses her? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The answer is ZERO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Allah provided ZERO protection to the innocent woman and her child in this case. This false accusation can be a result of any misunderstanding, or even if he is a mistrusting person, or simply if he is an evil person and only wants to harm her. </span></p>
<p>Furthermore, during this period, Islam forbids her from seeking the love and support of any other man through marriage until she delivers the child. This restriction is known as 'Iddah, which prolongs her emotional and social hardships.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This Islamic 'Iddah of a pregnant woman is based upon a scientific mistake of the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad), where he thought that the sperm of another man can water the fetus. In order to understand this scientific mistake of the writer of the Quran, please read our article: </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/31-‘iddah-waiting-period-is-illogical-injustice-against-women">‘Iddah (i.e. waiting period) is illogical &amp; unnecessary &amp; oppressive &amp; injustice against the women </a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, if a woman remarries, she is compelled to leave her children in the care of her relatives, such as her parents or sister. This is due to the belief held in Islam, as mentioned in two Fatwas (Fatwa 1 and Fatwa 2), that the child might suffer from the potential animosity of the new husband or the mother's preoccupation with her new marriage, leading to neglect of her children and potential harm to them. As a result, she loses the right of custody over her children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Please read the following two Fatwas (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210606140409/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/182019/why-a-wife-loses-custody-of-her-children-in-case-she-remarries">Fatwa 1</a> and <a title="Fatwa 2" href="https://darulifta-deoband.com/home/ur/talaq-divorce/19755">Fatwa 2</a>):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is true that if the mother remarries, she loses the right of the custody of her children, and some scholars reported a consensus among the scholars on this issue ... <br>“This is because the child is harmed by the <strong>hatred of the 2nd husband</strong> who may get fed up with him <strong>and because the mother, by necessity, may neglect her child out of her desire to please her husband</strong> and her being preoccupied by him, and all this harms the child. This is why she loses the right of fostering.” <br>Moreover, An-Nawawi from the Shaafi’e School of jurisprudence, said in “Al-Majmoo’”: <strong>“Because if she remarries, her husband has the right to enjoy her (at all times) except at the time of worship (i.e. when she is performing an act of worship), so she cannot foster her children (form a previous marriage)</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These justifications are flawed for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Islam's claim that stepfathers will invariably harbor hatred towards their stepchildren is unfounded. This issue emerged when Muhammad declared that adopted children could not be treated as biological children. This ruling was then extended to stepchildren, which goes against the natural inclination of parents to form meaningful bonds with their adopted or stepchildren.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Islam's assumption that a mother will neglect her children in order to please her new husband is a negative portrayal of mothers and contradicts the natural instinct of maternal care and love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that a woman's primary duty in her second marriage is to provide sexual services to her husband and that children hinder this purpose is an oppressive and unfair view of women and their roles within a family.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is unfortunate that many people, including a majority of Muslims, are unaware of these oppressive rulings within Islamic Sharia.</p>
<p>Due to the cruelty and oppression inherent in this Islamic ruling of separating a mother from her children upon remarriage, Islamic countries themselves have rejected this aspect of Sharia law. These laws were removed from the legal systems of Islamic countries due to their incompatibility with human rights and basic compassion.</p>
<p>Similar changes have occurred in the case of Khul' (خلع), where Islamic Sharia was once again abandoned by Muslims themselves. Courts were granted the right to grant freedom through Khul' without the requirement of paying ransom money, despite opposition from some Islamic scholars who believed it was solely the husband's right.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate how certain aspects of Islamic Sharia have been amended or discarded in various Islamic countries as they clashed with fundamental principles of fairness and justice.</p>

<h2>Why does Islam call the innocent child a BASTARD in the case of Liaan?</h2>
<p>Islam's treatment of the innocent child in the case of Liaan raises troubling questions. Not only does Islam permit the husband to accuse his wife and disown the child, but it goes even further:</p>
<p>Islam labels the child as a BASTARD (referred to as "Walad al-Haram" in Islamic terminology) despite the child's complete innocence. Even if the mother is proven innocent and wrongfully accused, the child bears this stigmatizing label.</p>
<p>The burden of the child's upbringing falls solely on the mother, with the father being exempt from any financial responsibilities towards the innocent child.</p>
<p>Even if the mother did make a mistake and engaged in a sexual act with another man, Islam still denies the biological father the right to acknowledge, love, and provide for the child. This raises the question: Why is Islam punishing the innocent child by depriving them of their biological father's love, care, and name?</p>
<p>Islam compels the so-called "Bastard" child to carry only the name of their mother, making them easily identifiable in society and subjecting them to humiliation.</p>
<p>These Sharia Rulings in Islam regarding innocent children seem to defy logic and reason, which raises doubts about their divine origin. Such flaws in the Sharia Rulings suggest that these decisions were the result of Muhammad's personal judgments rather than divine revelations from an all-knowing deity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please read our detailed article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/islam-general/102-innocent-children-why-are-they-called-‘illegitimate-bastards’-by-islam">Illegitimate Child: What is the WISDOM of Allah in calling them BASTARDS (Walad al-Haram), depriving them of the Name, Love, Upbringing and Inheritance of their fathers </a></span></p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists claim that Islam does not grant "Equal Rights" to women but instead provides them rights based on the principle of "Justice."</p>
<p>But are you really able to see any "Justice" with women in the case of Liaan?</p>]]></description>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId295968"></a>Summary:</h2>
<p>Currently, in many Muslim states,  if they are unhappy in their marriage (e.g., due to feelings of unattractiveness or dislike towards their husbands), then women are granted the option to seek divorce through the court, known as "Khul',".</p>
<p>However, this is not the original Sharia ruling.</p>
<p>According to the original Sharia ruling, women has no right to seek freedom through any court in the name of Khul'. Sharia mandated that a woman must remain with her husband, even in cases of abuse, physical violence (that doesn't result in broken bones), or if the husband was unattractive or undesirable.</p>
<p>In the original Islamic concept of Khul', a woman should offer "ransom money" to her husband. If he agrees to the offer, he can accept the money and divorce her, granting her freedom. However, if the husband declines the offer, no Islamic court has the authority to force him to divorce her, leaving the woman in a situation where she has to endure the hardships and abuse in the marriage.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId535419"></a>Detailed Rule of Khul':</h2>
<p>All four Sunni Imams of Fiqh concur on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman does not possess the right to initiate a divorce from her husband through Khul'.</li>
<li>The decision to grant her freedom through divorce solely rests with the husband, and he can choose to accept or reject it.</li>
<li>No Islamic court holds the authority to compel the husband to divorce her against his will.</li>
</ul>
<p>To seek approval from her husband:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wife must offer "ransom money," enticing the husband with financial gain, and persuade him to grant her a divorce.</li>
<li>There is no fixed amount for this "ransom money"; it often involves returning the Haq-Mehr (bridal price) she received during marriage or even offering more.</li>
<li>The husband has the liberty to demand any sum he desires, potentially using this as an opportunity to extort money from her.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the husband refuses to grant her freedom, even Islamic courts cannot force him to divorce her. In such a case, she is compelled to stay with her abusive husband.</p>
<p>Courts may intervene in exceptional cases, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>The impotence of the husband.</li>
<li>Failure of the husband to provide maintenance money.</li>
<li>If the husband's whereabouts are unknown.</li>
<li>If the husband is mentally ill.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if the husband behaves violently, beating the wife without reason and causing visible bruises, she cannot obtain Khul' or obtain freedom through Islamic courts. Only if the husband causes a physical injury that results in the <strong>breaking of a bone (or any other body part)</strong> can she seek a divorce through the court, but even then, she is required to pay the "<strong>ransom money</strong>" to her abusive husband.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId93874"></a>Quranic Verse about the Khul’</h2>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/2.229">2:229</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>الطَّلاَقُ مَرَّتَانِ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا إِلاَّ أَن يَخَافَا أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللّهِ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللّهِ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا <b>افْتَدَتْ </b>بِهِ </p>
<p>A divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should either hold Together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you, (Men), to take back any of your gifts (from your wives), except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah. If ye (judges) do indeed fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah, there is no blame on either of them <strong>if she gives something for her freedom (Arabic word:افْتَدَتْ  which means Ransom money).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId381609"></a>Muhammad said: "Women who seek their freedom through Khul’ are hypocrites"</h2>
<p>If a woman does not simply like her husband and seeks to get her freedom by using the greed of money of her husband, then Muhammad declared such women to be hypocrites. </p>

<p>This injustice against women can be summarized as follows:</p>

<li>Even in the face of severe physical abuse resulting in broken bones, a woman cannot obtain a divorce <strong>automatically</strong>.</li>
<li>Despite suffering physical harm, she still has to pay the ransom money for her freedom.</li>

<p>Although the woman wanted to be rid of her husband, Khul' was not her right in Islam; instead, it depended on the husband's will. Hence, despite her strong desire for freedom, she was unable to separate from him. Her second husband resorted to brutal beatings, causing bruises all over her body. However, he still refused to grant her a divorce or freedom through Khul'.</p>
<p>Notably, Muhammad did not prohibit the cruel man from beating her so brutally but remained silent about it (known as Hadith-e-Taqriri). Furthermore, Muhammad did not grant her the right to seek freedom through Khul' even after enduring such severe beatings.</p>
<p>Please note there is a "TEHRIF (Distortion)" in the English Translation. The Arabic words of the hadith are  إِنِّي لأَنْفُضُهَا نَفْضَ الأَدِيمِ and the correct translation is:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span> "I shake her like leather (during sex)</span></strong></span></span> i.e. Abdurrahman had already been raping her without her consent (i.e. doing sex). But despite that, she was unable to get Khul' from him. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId733238"></a>Even if the husband is infertile, a woman is not permitted to seek her freedom through Khul'</h2>
<p>All four Sunni Fiqh Imams unanimously agree that a wife cannot initiate a divorce based on the husband's infertility.</p>
<p>The largest Islamic Fatwa website Islam Q&amp;A writes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211011105923/https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21592/ruling-on-asking-for-a-divorce-from-a-husband-who-has-some-medical-problems">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With regard to the man’s sterility, i.e., his inability to father children, this is not counted as a fault that would necessitate annulment of the marriage, according to the majority of scholars, apart from the view of al-Hasan al-Basri, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In previous centuries, it was practically impossible to determine a man's infertility, making it an unattributable condition. This was also the case with Muhammad himself.</p>
<h2>How is a poor woman supposed to survive when her bones are broken, her Haq Mehr (dowry money) is taken away and she is thrown out of the house? </h2>
<p>Islamic apologists claim that Islam didn't give "equal" rights to women, but He gave them rights with "equity/justice". But this Islamic claim is only a deception. Let us see the reality of this so-called claim of Islam giving rights to women based on equity/justice. </p>
<p>According to Islam, the husband pays the Haq Mehr (dowry money) so that the woman remains confined to him. She must provide on-demand sexual services, keep herself beautiful for him, obey him, endure his beatings, but still continue providing sexual services. While the man is busy having sex with his other wives and numerous concubines, the woman has to wait for her husband and not look at any other man. In the name of the dowry money, the woman’s freedom to leave the house is also taken away. She cannot go out and work or earn money for herself without her husband’s permission.</p>
<p>But when a woman returns the dowry in a khula as ransom money, where do her charges for sexual services go? This poor woman hasn’t earned anything to use for her survival after divorce. That means she stands empty-handed after khula.</p>
<p>This poor woman wasted her youth providing sexual services to her husband, and now she is no longer a virgin, her value has decreased, and it is difficult for her to find another man because Islam’s another injustice is when the Prophet says that people should marry virgins.</p>
<p>Islam has not provided any protection for women. In the West, a woman gets half of the property and money made during the marriage in a divorce, but Islam does not give this right to women. In the case of a regular divorce (when the husband initiates it), Muslims argue that the woman should survive on the dowry money (meaning the dowry money is for providing free sexual services throughout life and also for surviving after divorce). But in the case of khula, when an abusive husband has destroyed the woman’s youth, taken sexual services from her, taken back all the dowry money in the name of ransom, and then broken her bones and thrown her out of the house, how is this poor woman supposed to cover her living expenses and other necessities and survive?</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: In an Islamic society, even if an abusive husband beats the wife severely and even breakes her bones, she still not dare to initiate divorce through Khul' due to fear of survival. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId257583"></a>Islamic apologists claim that women are "emotional," justifying the husband's role in deciding whether divorce is in her favor or not</h2>
<p>This view is flawed as it unfairly blames women for being emotional while disregarding the fact that men can also be emotional and make false decisions in anger.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, Islam has made it incredibly easy for men to divorce their wives by merely uttering "Talaq" (divorce) three times, even in a state of extreme and uncontrolled anger.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId283200"></a>Islam Apologists: But the Sunnah way of giving Talaq is 3 menstrual periods</h2>
<p>It does not matter if it is a Sunnah way or not; Islamic Sharia indeed allows men to divorce their wives in anger by saying "talaq" three times.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the divorce process is designed to last three menstrual periods to ensure that husbands calm down, it also allows women to cool off from their anger or emotions. Therefore, Islam should also grant women the right to initiate divorce after three months, once they are no longer in a state of emotional distress or anger.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if Islam does not grant women this right to make their own decisions even after three months (claiming they are too emotional), then Islam should at least give this right to the woman's father, brother, or son to decide on her behalf.</p>
<p>However, when Islam states that if a woman wishes for her freedom, it is ONLY the husband who should decide whether divorce is in her favor or not, this is not wisdom. Rather, it places poor women entirely at the mercy of their husbands.<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId271840"></a>Muslim women should reflect on these questions:</h2>
<p>If you are a Muslim woman, take a moment to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you were in the position of Allah and responsible for making laws, would you have created a law like Khul' for women?</li>
<li>Can you believe that such an "Unjust" law like Khul' could be formulated by a divine being of infinite wisdom?</li>
<li>Do you accept the notion that women are solely emotional and unable to decide for themselves in matters concerning their lives?</li>
<li>Is it fair that, even in cases of differences and disputes, and despite your strong desire to separate, your husband gets to decide whether divorce is in your best interest or not?</li>
<li>Do you not realize that the concept of "Allah" does not grant you the right to seek freedom while believing that women possess a "lower Intelligence Level" compared to men?</li>
<li>Don't you feel that these unjust laws, such as Khul', are not divinely ordained but rather a result of man-made beliefs, considering women as inferior and always subservient to men?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your innate human rationale and sense of humanity are sufficient to guide you and discern right from wrong.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId365935"></a>Distinguishing between "Islamic Laws" and the "Laws of Muslim Countries":</h2>
<p>It is essential to carefully differentiate between these two aspects, as some individuals may attempt to deceive others by conflating them.</p>
<p>The true Islamic rulings have been previously outlined (e.g., Khul' not being an inherent right of women but dependent on the husband's decision to grant freedom).</p>
<p>Throughout the past 14 centuries of Islamic history, this ruling remained unchanged.</p>
<p>However, in the current century, owing to the influence of the Western Feminist Movement, even women in Islamic countries are becoming aware of their fundamental rights as human beings.</p>
<p>As a result, these feminist movements within Muslim countries have actively challenged and contested the traditional Divorce/Khul' ruling of Islam. To their astonishment, they have achieved success in "ALTERING" this original Islamic ruling in numerous Muslim countries.</p>
<p>Nowadays, women in many Muslim countries can approach the court and request Khul' without having to pay a ransom.</p>
<p>Initially, Islamic scholars attempted to resist these changes, but due to the inherent conflict with principles of humanity, their efforts did not succeed.</p>
<p>Similar to how Muslim men once did not require permission from their first wife to marry another, the feminist movement's strong opposition has led to changes in some Muslim countries. Now, Muslim men are required to seek written permission from their first wife before marrying another woman.</p>
<p>For example, refer to the following two studies that illustrate how courts were granted the authority to grant freedom in Khul' without the need for ransom money, despite opposition from Islamic scholars who believed it to be the husband's right according to Sharia law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><b>Abstract</b>: <br>Pakistan is an Islamic country. The laws made by the Parliament and Judiciary are administered according to the injunction of Islam. There are many laws made for the protections of women. Among these rights granted, right of women to khul " is also awarded by Islamic Law. Khul " is the proposal given to the husband by the wife for divorce. Judicial Khul " is exercised in Pakistani courts, according to Article 2(ix) of dissolution of Muslims Marriages Act 1939. <b>A large number of Ulama (Islamic Jurists) even today, refuse to recognize khul " granted by courts without the consent of the husband as a valid divorce. Confusion is caused by two parallel and conflicting interpretations of the Islamic Law. On one hand, there is the statutory law and interpretation by the Superior Courts of Pakistan and on the other hand, is the interpretation of Jurists of Islamic Law with strong arguments from Qur " an and Sunnah</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In simple terms, it was not an external plot or a Western conspiracy against Islam, but rather an internal struggle within the Muslim community that led to the defeat of the Sharia ruling on Khul'. Muslims themselves played a significant role in this change as they rebelled against the ruling and eventually removed it from the laws of their countries.</p>
<p>Actually, this changed Ruling in state laws is a "Bid'ah" (Innovation) in Sharia. But today Muslims are simply helpless, and they have to introduce this Bid'ah in the original Sharia Ruling. <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>]]></description>

			<title>Zihar (Another unjust Islamic way to Divorce a woman)</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If a perfect God truly exists, it would be expected for them to deliver a revelation that is also perfect from the very beginning.</p>
<p>However, if a human is responsible for claiming a divine revelation, it is likely to contain imperfections and human errors. Such a human-made revelation would require a process of trial and error to eliminate these flaws.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a human-made revelation is often influenced by the personal desires and wishes of the individual presenting it, reflecting worldly concerns rather than divine perfection.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination of the revelations in Islam, it becomes evident that they are far from perfect. <span style="color: #e03e2d;">They bear the imprint of human fallibility, the trial and error approach, and adherence to the worldly desires of Muhammad and the people in his circle</span>.</p>
<p>One notable case that exemplifies this is the incident of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zihar">Zihar</a>. </p>
<p>During the era of ignorance in Arab society, there was a peculiar custom known as Zihar. If a man, in a fit of anger or unintentionally, compared his wife to his mother or her back to his mother's back, it was considered grounds for separation, akin to a divorce.  It was really a foolish practice of the people of the time of ignorance. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, when Islam emerged, it continued to endorse this foolish tradition of Zihar.</p>
<p>One incident involves a companion of Muhammad who divorced his wife, Khuwaylah, through Zihar. Seeking justice, Khuwaylah approached Muhammad and expressed her grievances. However, Muhammad did not resolve her issue. Instead, against her wishes, he informed her that her husband had likened her to his mother, making him no longer her spouse but merely a cousin-brother. It is important to note that in Islam, once divorced, it is nearly impossible for a wife to remarry her husband unless she undergoes the degrading practice of <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/29-halala-tahleel-marriage">Halala</a>. Nonetheless, Zihar is even more stringent than Talaq (divorce), as it prevents the couple from reuniting even after Halala.</p>
<p>In response, Khuwaylah, the female companion, became furious and vehemently disagreed with Muhammad. She refused to leave and engaged in a dispute with him.</p>
<p>To resolve the situation and dismiss Khuwaylah, Muhammad conveniently claimed to receive a revelation from Allah. The revelation stated that Zihar had been abrogated, allowing Khuwaylah to reunite with her husband.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/58.1?context=4">58:1-4</a>:<br>Certainly has Allah heard the speech of the one who argues with you, [O Muhammad], concerning her husband and directs her complaint to Allah. And Allah hears your dialogue; indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing. If any men among you divorce their wives by Zihar (calling them mothers), they cannot be their mothers: None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And in fact, they use words (both) iniquitous and false: but truly Allah is one that blots out (sins), and forgives (again and again). Those who call their wives their mothers then revoke what they had said, should free a slave before having physical contact (with them). This is to warn you, as God is aware of what you do. If one does not have the means (of doing so) then he should fast for two months continuously before he has physical contact; but anyone who is unable to do so, should feed sixty needy persons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Divine revelation should inherently be flawless, without any need for trial and error.</p>
<p>It is perplexing that while Allah had previously revealed the commandments for normal marriage and divorce, the harmful practice of Zihar was still allowed to persist.</p>
<p>Why did Allah not prohibit Zihar, along with other foolish divorce practices like Ila, right from the beginning? If Allah is truly perfect, it would be expected that He would have prohibited it without delay.</p>
<p>Due to Allah's negligence in prohibiting it, this unfortunate woman had to engage in an ongoing dispute with Muhammad to seek its abrogation.</p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad's response is also puzzling. Despite the women's awareness that Zihar was an evil and foolish practice, Muhammad did not demonstrate the same understanding. He did not ask Allah to prohibit it, but instead repeatedly advised the woman to forget about her husband and move on.</p>
<p>If Allah, who is claimed to be 100% perfect, had not previously prohibited Zihar, He could have immediately abrogated it when the woman first requested it. However, it seems that Allah chose to observe the entire drama of the dispute between the woman and Muhammad, only revealing the solution when she persisted in her disagreement, enabling Muhammad to rid himself of her.</p>
<p>Even in these revealed verses, the alleged 100% perfect Allah displayed a lack of wisdom in handling this problem appropriately.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, please read about how Khuwayla secretly bore the burden of the penalty on her own, without her husband's knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2214">Sunan Abu Dawud 2214</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Khuwaylah, daughter of Malik ibn Tha'labah:<br>My husband, Aws ibn as-Samit, pronounced the words: You are like my mother. So I came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), complaining to him about my husband.<br><strong>The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) disputed with me and said: Remain dutiful to Allah; he is your cousin.</strong><br><strong>I continued (complaining)</strong> until the Qur'anic verse came down: "Allah hath heard the words of her who disputeth with thee concerning her husband…." till the prescription of expiation.<br>He then said: He should set free a slave. She said: He cannot afford it. He said: He should fast for two consecutive months. She said: Apostle of Allah, he is an old man; he cannot keep fasts. He said: He should feed sixty poor people. She said: He has nothing which he may give in alms. At that moment an araq (i.e. date-basket holding fifteen or sixteen sa's) was brought to him.<br>I said: I shall help him with another date-basked ('araq). He said: You have done well. Go and feed sixty poor people, and return to your cousin.<br>(Abu Dawud said)<em><strong> She paid the penalty secretly, without telling her husband</strong>. </em><br>(This tradition is "Sahih" i.e. authentic. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160901063947/http://dorar.net/h/3618689c544c8d58aea06cd9e73a4318">Link</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please take note:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is indeed peculiar and foolish that although the mistake of Zihar was committed by the husband, it was the poor woman who had to bear the penalty. Such a scenario raises questions about the nature of Divine Justice.</li>
<li>Furthermore, why did Allah not completely eliminate the issue by entirely abrogating Zihar? In the non-Muslim world, we do not encounter any problems related to Zihar. So, why did Allah persist in addressing it through various penalties? It is worth noting that these penalties predominantly burden the woman alone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Only the husband has the right to Zihar, while the woman has no right</h3>
<p>A significant disparity exists when it comes to Zihar: only the husband has the right to invoke it, while the woman is deprived of this right.</p>
<p>This inconsistency highlights further <strong>double standards</strong>.</p>
<p>When a woman compares her husband to her father, she can do so repeatedly without any consequences, and the husband can continue their intimate relationship (refer to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160829092726/http://www.urdufatwa.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/9886/206/">detailed fatwa</a> for more information).</p>
<p>If uttering the words of Zihar truly had any effect, it should impact both men and women equally. However, this is not the case. One can only question the notion of Divine Justice when only the words of men hold significance.</p>
<p>In reality, neither the words of men nor women hold any weight in this matter. It is simply a <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>non-issue</strong></span>, <span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong>born out of foolishness and ignorance rooted in outdated cultural practices</strong></span>. Unfortunately, the supposedly 100% perfect Allah failed to eliminate it. This suggests that Muhammad was not truly in contact with a divine entity in the heavens but rather formulated these revelations independently, leading to these human errors within the revelation.</p>
<h3>Zihar vs marrying the wife of the Adopted son</h3>
<p>Islam presents a perplexing contrast in its reasoning. On one hand, according to Islamic logic, if a man repeatedly refers to someone as his son, even after adopting him, that child cannot be considered a Mahram to the man's family. Consequently, a foster mother must be separated from her adopted son as soon as he reaches adulthood, resulting in the son being expelled from the household,  as he could no longer stay under one roof with his foster mother. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Islam dictates that if a husband compares his wife to his mother, it leads to an immediate and permanent divorce. These contradictions epitomize double standards and reach the height of absurdity.</p>
<p> Therefore, their religious beliefs demonstrate inconsistency and lack logical coherence, and taking pride in it is inherently foolish.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ila (الإيلاء): Another Tool given in hands of Husbands by Islam to control their wives by punishing them </title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>During the era of pre-Islamic ignorance in Arabia, a custom called "Ila (الإيلاء)" existed, which enabled men to exert control and manipulate their wives.</p>
<p>"Ila" involved a husband taking an oath to abstain from sexual relations with his wife for a minimum of four months. If he honored the oath, the marriage would be dissolved; failing to do so would keep the marriage intact.</p>
<p>Ila was essentially a tool wielded by husbands to manipulate their wives into complying with their demands. Women were treated as mere possessions, devoid of the autonomy to decide for themselves, and were entirely subject to the desires of their husbands for their future.</p>
<p>Given the absence of a higher divine authority and considering that Muhammad himself was the source of the revelations, coupled with his adherence to the prevailing customs of Arab culture during that era of ignorance, he incorporated Ila into Islamic Sharia law, thereby compromising justice.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/2/st29.htm">2:226-228</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="stcl2"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four month</span></strong>s, but if they return [to normal relations] - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. And if they decide on divorce - then indeed, Allah is Hearing and Merciful. Divorced women remain in waiting for three periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day.<strong> And their husbands have more right to take them back in this period [even against the wishes and the consent of the wife] if they want reconciliation</strong>.<strong> And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable.</strong> But the men have a degree over them. <br>[Translation: <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/2/st29.htm">Umm Muhammad, Sahih International</a>, and <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/2/st29.htm">Corpus Quran</a>]</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Islamic Sharia imposes oppressive measures on women through Ila, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Subjecting the wife to a form of solitary confinement, where she is compelled to remain within her husband's household for a period of 4 months without receiving any love or attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing a husband to inflict punishment on his wife by keeping her uncertain about her future for the entire 4-month duration. During this time, the wife remains unaware of whether her husband intends to continue their marriage or evict her from their home once the 4 months pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ila effectively functions as a tool enabling husbands to blackmail their wives into complying with their demands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if the husband is entirely at fault or has malicious intentions, and seeks to exploit Ila to manipulate and coerce his wife, she is left defenseless against this form of blackmail. Islamic Courts are not empowered to intervene and safeguard the wife from such manipulation by her husband.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the husband decides to divorce his wife after the 4-month Ila period, the woman then faces additional hardships during the 'Idah (waiting period), which extends for an additional 3 months (or 3 menstrual cycles). Throughout this period, she once again experiences a form of isolation and is burdened by numerous restrictions, further highlighting the one-sided challenges placed upon women (Please read our article on <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/94-does-halal-slaughter-produce-better-meat-quality">‘Iddah</a> for details of these one-sided hardships upon the women). This implies that a husband has the potential to subject his wife to these restrictions for a total duration of 7 months if he chooses to punish her in this manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reform of such abusive husbands is only possible when the wife has the freedom to leave his home rather than being confined and subjected to his cruelty. She should have the liberty to walk away from the abuse, and the husband should be aware that if he does not reform himself, his wife has the right to leave him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merely stating in the Quran that “women also have some rights” is only a recommendation, and leaving her at the mercy of her husband without any “<strong>practical measures</strong>” for her protection is foolishness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to the wife, Islam provides the husband with the following privileges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While the wife is confined in a situation akin to solitary confinement and is denied the right to experience love and attention, the husband himself is granted the complete freedom to enjoy his life, engage in intimate relations with his other wives, and even have sexual relations with his dozens of slave girls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, Islam affords the husband the unrestricted right to reclaim his wife within a span of 4 months and engage in sexual intercourse with her, even if it goes against her wishes. This means, even after the punishing 4 months of solitary confinement, the poor woman still does not get the right to have a divorce from such an abusive husband. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, Islam permits a husband, as a means of punishment, to "prolong" his wife's suffering by repeatedly employing the practice of Ila. This involves engaging in sexual intercourse with his wife before the initial 4-month period concludes, followed by a subsequent vow to abstain from physical contact for another 4 months. As atonement for each instance of Ila, the husband is only required to either provide food for 10 needy individuals or observe fasting for a duration of 3 days. In that way, a husband is able to keep his wife in a permanent solitary confinement situation and she has no chance to get her freedom. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Earlier Verse of <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">JUSTICE</span> among multiple wives is Practically <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">ABROGATED</span></h2>
<p>When Allah (i.e. Muhammad) initially allowed men to have four wives, then it was conditioned with doing <strong>JUSTICE</strong> to all of them. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://quranx.com/4.3">4:3</a>: </p>
<p>فَٱنكِحُوا۟ مَا طَابَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ مَثْنَىٰ وَثُلَٰثَ وَرُبَٰعَ ۖ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>تَعْدِلُوا۟</strong></span> فَوَٰحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ</p>
<p>... then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be able to do <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Justice</strong></span> (Arabic:<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>تَعْدِلُوا۟</strong></span>) with them, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses (i.e. slave women).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But later Allah (i.e. Muhammad) abrogated this condition of Justice, and gave a licence to men to usurp the rights of their wives in the name of "settlement/reconciliation". </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.128?context=3">4:128-129</a>):</p>
<p><span>وَإِنِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ خَافَتْ مِنۢ بَعْلِهَا نُشُوزًا أَوْ إِعْرَاضًا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يُصْلِحَا بَيْنَهُمَا صُلْحًا ... وَلَن تَسْتَطِيعُوٓا۟ أَن <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>تَعْدِلُوا۟</strong></span> بَيْنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتُمْ</span></p>
<p>And if a woman fears from her husband <strong>contempt</strong> or <strong>evasion</strong>, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of <strong>settlement</strong> between them (i.e. woman agrees upon leaving some of her rights) … <strong>And you will never be able to do <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">Justice</span> (Arabic: تَعْدِلُوْا) between wives, even if you should strive [to do so]</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The background of this verse is that, after gaining power and wealth in Medina, Muhammad married several new, young, and beautiful women, and then began to find the presence of his elderly wife, Saudah, burdensome, as he had to spend a night with her on her turn. Subsequently, he claimed the revelation of a verse that granted him the right to divorce any of his wives “<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>without any reason.</strong></span>” And out of all his wives, the only one he chose to divorce was the unfortunate <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>elderly</strong></span> Saudah. Despite having been with him since the time in Mecca, caring for his daughters when he was weak and poor, Muhammad selected to divorce her, showing no regard for her age or her past loyalty. He was prepared to leave her homeless, knowing well that no man would marry her at her age to provide support.</p>
<p>Saudah also knew very well that all this revelation is only a DRAMA, and the main issue wasn’t divorce itself, but rather the desire to spend nights with his young, newly-wed young wives. So, she approached Aisha and offered her own night’s turn to her, requesting that Muhammad not divorce her.</p>
<p>When Muhammad learned that Saudah had given her night’s turn to Aisha, he became happy and he promptly claimed another revelation (Quran 4:128-129), which granted men the permission to “settle” with their wives by threatening them with abandonment, Ila, or divorce, essentially enabling them to “blackmail” their wives and force them to relinquish their rights. As for “justice,” it became a mockery, as the verse stated that a man cannot achieve justice among his wives, even if he tries.</p>
<p>For more details, please read our article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/69-adam-came-only-6000-years-ago-according-to-islamic-traditions">Muhammad's journey from 4 marriages to 9 marriages with the help of Revelation</a></p>
<h2>Muslim Excuse: Limiting Ila to 4 months is an achievement of Islam and a favour to women</h2>
<p>It is unfortunate that Muslim scholars are entirely immersed in religious brainwashing. The extent of this brainwashing is evident from the fact that, rather than acknowledging the oppressive nature of Islamic Ila toward women, they actually present it as an achievement of Islam.</p>
<p>I was astonished while reading the commentaries and writings of Islamic scholars, where they were misleading the public by claiming that, in the era of ignorance, there was no fixed duration for Ila, and it could exceed 4 months. But they portray it as an achievement of Allah and a favor to women that Ila was restricted to just 4 months.</p>
<p>One can only hold their head in dismay at the mental state of these Muslim scholars and feel saddened at how they have turned Allah’s clear injustice and oppression toward women into a supposed favour for them.</p>
<p><strong>Muslim Excuse</strong>: <em>Ila</em> period provides a chance for both husband and wife to reflect on their actions and correct mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: While a temporary separation may indeed help improve a relationship, <em>Ila</em> is solely a tool wielded by husbands, often leading to increased control over their wives. If the husband is the one at fault, <em>Ila</em> does little to reform his behavior. Instead, it may even encourage further mistreatment by allowing him to misuse this power, worsening the wife’s situation rather than fostering positive change.</p>
<p>Moreover, Muslims also assert that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The West gave women "Equal Rights". But they consider it a mistake. </li>
<li>For Muslims, women don't need "Equal Rights", but they need rights on the basis of  "JUSTICE". </li>
</ul>
<p>However, this assertion by Muslims lacks validity. The divine Allah they worship did not bestow women with equitable rights, nor did it establish these rights on the foundation of justice. Yes, their Allah is UNJUST and he gave rights to women neither on the bases of equality nor on the basis of justice. </p>
<p>Consequently, women remain vulnerable to the tyranny and manipulation of their male counterparts, without adequate safeguards.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Western world, driven by human intellect, recognized women as equal beings to men. It bestowed women with parallel rights, including the crucial right to divorce, thus thwarting any potential for malevolent individuals to exploit and blackmail them. This approach from the West ensures comprehensive protection for women against all forms of oppression and coercion.</p>

			<title>Halala (Tahleel Marriage)</title>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId869892"></a>Summary:</h2>
<p data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[1,63,0,0]}"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_halala">Halala</a> is a Sharia Ruling, according to which:</p>
<ul data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[210,520,0,0]}">
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[210,394,1,0]}">If a husband and a wife are separated through a divorce, and later they reconcile and want to remarry, then Islam forbids such remarriage and does not allow them to come together again.</li>
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[395,520,1,0]}">Islam stipulates, there is only one way for them to come together again, and that is Halala (Tahleel Marriage نكاح التحليل).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the process of Islamic Halala:</p>
<ol>
<li>The woman must initially marry a different man.</li>
<li>Subsequently, consummate the marriage with this new husband.</li>
<li>Only if the second husband divorces her does she become eligible to remarry her initial husband.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the implementation of Halala introduces a host of potential challenges and hardships that predominantly fall upon the woman. For instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a husband impulsively utters Talaq (divorce) to his wife three times in a fit of anger, it can abruptly shatter the entire family unit.</li>
<li>In these situations, the woman often bears the brunt of the consequences, even if she is entirely blameless and the divorce stems entirely from the husband's actions.</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictable Outcomes:</strong> Even if a woman is willing to endure the tribulations of Halala, there is no assurance that the second husband will eventually grant her freedom by initiating a divorce. Consequently, she could find herself permanently bound to her second husband, unable to reunite with her children, family, and former spouse. This inherent uncertainty presents an elevated risk for women involved in Halala proceedings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why Do Muslim Women Agree to the Disturbing Practice of Halala?</p>
<p>The motivation behind why Muslim women willingly subject themselves to the distressing process of Halala, which involves engaging in sexual relations with another man, can be understood through the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islam practically "forces" poor women to do so.</li>
<li>In Islam, if a woman is divorced, then either she has to live her remaining life as a <strong>single</strong>, otherwise she would lose the "<strong>custody</strong>" of her children if she "<strong>remarries</strong>".</li>
<li>Thus the only option for a woman to have both (i.e. to have the love and support of a man, and also to have her children) is to return to his first husband. That is why, Muslim women still agree to undergo this shameful process of Halala and being raped by another man. </li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of Halala underscores the intricate and unjust dynamics embedded within Islamic divorce rulings, particularly highlighting the vulnerabilities and uncertainties that women may face under such circumstances.</p>

<p data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[3903,4262,0,0]}">The process of Halala brings a lot of shame and humiliation and risks for a Muslim woman in an Islamic society, and people don't look good at the women who undergo the Halala process. But many divorced Muslim women still wish (or even feel compelled) to undergo the humiliation of the process of Halala in order to reunite with their ex-husband.</p>
<p data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[3903,4262,0,0]}">But why? </p>
<p data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[4264,4290,0,0]}">The factors for Muslim women's readiness to even undergo this shameful process of Halala are as under.</p>
<h3 id="First_Reason:_She_still_loves_her_ex-husband_despite_the_temporary_anger" data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[4292,4370,3,3]}" data-mw-section-id="4"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId892838"></a>The Primary Factor: Lingering Affection for the Former Spouse Despite Temporary Conflicts</h3>
<p>Human beings inherently encompass a spectrum of emotions, encompassing both love and anger. Temporarily succumbing to mistakes due to fits of anger is a common human inclination. Consider a scenario where a husband impulsively utters Talaq (divorce) three times in the heat of the moment. Should this impulsive act permanently preclude any opportunity for rectification? Is it reasonable to believe that such a fleeting episode erases the entirety of their shared affection? In alignment with human nature, it remains entirely plausible for a woman to continue harboring love for her former husband, and vice versa, despite the occurrence of divorce. </p>
<p>The essential premise is this that their enduring "mutual affection" and "collective consensus" should serve as a substantial rationale to permit their reuniting in marriage. In truth, if they are willing to rekindle their union, it becomes imperative to offer robust "encouragement and assistance" to facilitate their reunion. This course of action is not only advantageous for the couple themselves, but also profoundly beneficial for the well-being of their children. Disallowing their reunion contradicts human nature, defies logical reasoning, and imposes gratuitous hardships upon both the couple and their children.</p>
<p>Islamic defenders frequently present a single justification: the prescribed three menstruation cycles (or three months) for proper divorce proceedings. They contend that this timeframe adequately allows both parties, man and woman, to reconcile and resolve their disputes before resorting to divorce. But if they still get divorced, then it is their punishment from Allah that the woman has to undergo Halala (or even worse, they can never reunite as the newer husband refuses to divorce her).</p>
<p>However, this assertion crumbles under scrutiny.</p>
<p>This defense lacks substance, as it disregards the complexities of human nature. In reality, conflicts and disagreements often persist beyond the confines of a mere three months. The notion that all disputes can be effectively addressed and resolved within this brief span is inherently unrealistic.</p>
<p>For a woman, the experience of residing with her parents or siblings, often alongside her children, highlights the adversities of life without a partner. Similarly, a man navigating life without his spouse or children, or single-handedly caring for the children himself, gains insight into the challenges of such a situation. The process of taking time apart engenders a realization of the depth of their feelings for each other and underscores the void that separation creates.</p>
<p>Therefore, the mandated three-month period, while imposed with the intention of promoting reconciliation, contradicts both logic and the intricacies of human emotions. It ignores the fact that resolving disputes and rekindling relationships often necessitate more time than this rigid timeframe allows.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this 3 months period limitation is actually not based upon WISDOM of any Divine Being in the heavens, but Muhammad simply copied this pre-existed practice of Halala from his Arab culture of the time of Jahiliyyah (ignorance). In another words, the WISDOM of pre-Islamic Arabs and the WISDOM of Allah are EQUAL in limiting the time period to 3 months to resolve the disputes. Failing this, it is predominantly the woman who bears the consequences, subjected to the distressing ordeal of Halala.</p>

<p>When divorce occurs, then both individuals must establish separate living arrangements, Consequently, children are also separated from one parent, whether the father or mother. In either scenario, the cohesive fabric of family life for these children is disrupted. As a result, numerous divorced Muslim women express the desire to reconcile with their former spouses, driven by the profound concern for their children's well-being. This aspiration is grounded in the earnest wish to offer their children the invaluable experience of growing up in an environment where the love and presence of both parents coexist within a single household.</p>

<p>The Halala Ruling intertwines with another significant Islamic Ruling. According to this tenet, a woman risks losing all custody of her children if she chooses to marry any man other than her ex-husband. The rationale rests on the premise that a wife's time, excluding periods of prayer, belongs solely to her new husband, who retains the right to summon her for intimate purposes at his discretion. However, the presence of children from her previous marriage hinders the second husband's entitlement to engage in these activities. Hence, the directive dictates that a woman must be separated from her children should she opt to marry another individual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2276">Sunan Abi Dawud 2276</a>:</span></p>
<p><span>A woman said: Messenger of Allah, my womb is a vessel to this son of mine, my breasts, a water-skin for him, and my lap a guard for him, yet his father has divorced me, and wants to take him away from me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You have more right to him as long as you do not marry (to another man)</strong></span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The convergence of these two Islamic rulings significantly impacts divorced Muslim mothers, placing them in a challenging conundrum. Effectively, they are coerced into selecting from the following three unfavorable alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Their first option is to choose to stay with their children, but the evil for them is that they have to give away their right to remarry any other man. In an Islamic society, it is very difficult for a woman to survive alone. She has to face a lot of restrictions (like taking Hijab and not to make interaction with men). Thus, her life becomes really difficult to go outside of the house, and then to find a good job, and then to work the whole day there, and at the same time look after her small children at home too. Thus, the easiest way for a divorced woman to survive in an Islamic society is to remarry and get the support of another man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, they may choose to marry a man of their choosing, seeking both emotional and financial support. Yet, this choice bears the grievous consequence of having all their children forcibly separated from them – a heart-wrenching reality that no mother should endure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their third option involves remarrying their ex-husband. While this course provides financial stability and the mother is not separated from her children, it necessitates the participation in Halala – a distressing and undignified process that compels them to yield their bodies against their wishes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In sum, the intricate interplay between these two "Islamic Rulings" forces divorced Muslim mothers into a challenging position. They must contend with choosing between relinquishing their right to remarry, enduring the heartbreak of losing their children, or submitting to the humiliating process of Halala. This predicament underscores the complex and often oppressive nature of  Islamic practices concerning divorce and remarriage.</p>
<h2 id="Risks,_that_are_involved_in_Halala_for_a_woman" data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[8581,8631,2,2]}" data-mw-section-id="7"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId806298"></a>Risks Associated with Halala for Women</h2>
<p>Engaging in the practice of Halala exposes women to three significant risks, each carrying its own set of challenges.</p>
<p>Firstly, a distressing scenario arises if the second husband elects to withhold divorce. Under Islamic Sharia, women possess neither the right to initiate a divorce nor the option of Khul' (as elaborated in our <a title="Khul'" href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Khul%27" rel="mw:WikiLink" data-parsoid="{&quot;stx&quot;:&quot;simple&quot;,&quot;a&quot;:{&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Khul'&quot;},&quot;sa&quot;:{&quot;href&quot;:&quot;Khul'&quot;},&quot;dsr&quot;:[9110,9119,2,2]}" data-ve-attributes="{&quot;rel&quot;:&quot;mw:WikiLink&quot;}">Khul'</a> article for further insights).</p>
<p>Secondly, an even graver concern surfaces when the second husband not only retains her as his wife but resorts to abusive behavior, subjecting her to physical violence. This maltreatment coerces her into submission, compelling her to provide sexual services wholeheartedly. It's essential to note that Islamic Sharia sanctions a husband's severe beating, even inflicting bruises, should his wife fail to meet his sexual expectations adequately. Regrettably, no recourse to an Islamic court guarantees her emancipation from such an abusive union, unless the husband physically harms her to the extent of breaking bones or any other part of her body.

<p>Thirdly, a woman faces a formidable hazard known as the "Ghayrah" of her first husband. Once intimacy with the second husband occurs, her status and worth depreciate in the eyes of her first spouse. The affection he once held may wane, particularly within an emotionally charged and sensitive Islamic society that emphasizes Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة‎) –. Consequently, broader society views a woman who partakes in Halala – an attempt to reunite with her former husband and children – with disapproval. The negative sentiment extends beyond societal perception, potentially manifesting in the first husband's refusal to remarry her based on the premise of Ghayrah, even after she secures a divorce from her second spouse.</p>

<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[12467,12698,1,0]}">Either this Sahabia lady (i.e. female companion) was telling a lie that her 2nd husband was impotent (and that too in front of Prophet Muhammad himself), or her 2nd husband was telling a lie when he claimed not to be impotent. Muhammad later declared that female companion to be a lair, while her 2nd husband already had 2 sons from his other wife. </li>
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[12805,13293,1,0]}">So, what compelled that female companion to come up with this lie of impotency of her husband? The answer is, Islam does not allow a woman to get rid of her abusive husband in any way, except for some exceptional cases of Fask (i.e. Dissolution of Marriage) or Khul'.</li>
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[12805,13293,1,0]}">In <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/chrome://editor/content/blanks/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;catid=11">Faskh فسخ (i.e. dissolution of marriage)</a>, an Islamic court can grant a divorce to a woman in 4 exceptional cases (1)<strong> If the husband is <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">IMPOTENT</span></strong> (2) If he is insane (3) If his whereabouts are not known for many years (4) If he does not pay the maintenance money.

But it is not a Right of a woman, but still a right of the husband. In Islamic Khul', a woman has to offer "ransom money" to her husband. If he accepts the money offer and divorces her, then she will get rid of him. Nevertheless, if he denies taking the offer, then no Islamic court can compel him to divorce her. In this case, she is not going to get rid of him. (Please also note, in this century many Islamic countries have changed the law of Khul', and they have indeed allowed women to separate themselves from their husbands through court, even without offering ransom money, and even without his consent. But it is only a Bid'ah (i.e. Innovation) in the original Islamic Ruling).  </li>

<p data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[16676,16881,0,0]}">An Islamic apologist gave the following reason (<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-logic-behind-Nikah-Halala-which-makes-the-reunion-of-a-divorced-couple-so-difficult">link</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Islam, only the husband has the right to give a divorce. Thus, if a husband wants to remarry his ex-wife, it means that he made a mistake and divorced her in anger. That is why Halala is a punishment for the 1st husband for his bad temper. It is a severe punishment for him to share his wife with another person. The ruling of Halala is there, so that the husband does not take the issue of divorce lightly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[17198,17332,0,0]}">However, this line of reasoning is flawed and devoid of wisdom, as the Halala ruling is also punishing the wife and the children (even in cases when they are totally innocent). </p>
<p>Primarily, even if it was the complete fault of the 1st husband of giving the divorce, still it is the wife who bears the brunt of the divorce procedure's hardships:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ordeal commences with the three-month duration of divorce, during which she remains confined to her husband's residence, deprived of his affection or intimacy. This period resembles solitary confinement, deeply affecting her emotional and mental state [<strong>Note</strong>: Traditionally, a divorce can also happen when the husbands pronounces 3 Talaqs in a single sitting. It can save the woman from 3 months solitary confinement like situation].</li>
<li>Subsequently, she must endure the three additional menstrual cycles of 'Iddah, another phase of isolation where her sexual desires and emotional needs remain unfulfilled. This period exacerbates her emotional distress.</li>
<li>Following this, she enters the grueling process of marrying another man, subjecting herself to physical intimacy against her volition. This is succeeded by the six-month ordeal encompassing the second divorce (Talaq) and subsequent 'Iddah.</li>
<li>If the second husband proves to be abusive and forces her to remain against her will, she faces a lifetime of physical and emotional abuse, detached from her children. In this instance, the Halala process effectively condemns her to perpetual misery, as she endures forced intimacy and separation from her children.e</li>
<li>Adding to her ordeal, she confronts the disdain of Islamic society, which deems Halala antithetical to female modesty. Her status dwindles in the eyes of her initial husband, potentially straining their relationship or impeding his willingness to remarry her.</li>
</ul>
<p>The predicament extends to the innocent children, who grapple with the burdensome consequences of being separated from their mother when she moves to the second husband's household, in accordance with Islamic principles.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the defense of Halala as a response to a husband's temper falls short in adequately addressing the immense physical, emotional, and psychological toll it inflicts upon the wife, children, and the societal fabric as a whole.</p>

</ul>
<p data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[22463,22534,0,0]}">And the second party is of Islam critics, who counter this by claiming:</p>
<ul data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[22536,24172,0,0]}">
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[22536,22664,1,0]}">Halala is in its EVERY form oppressing the woman and the children (either it is Hanafi/Shafi'i Fiqhs, or it is Hanbali/Maliki Fiqhs).</li>
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[22665,22753,1,0]}">The only difference is one is MORE harmful, while the other is a little bit LESS harmful.</li>
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[22754,22985,1,0]}">If we accept the Hanafi/Shafi'i Fiqhs as a true Islam (i.e. marrying another person with the intention of divorce is allowed), then it brings less harm to the woman and the children and they have indeed a chance to reunite.</li>
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[22986,23460,1,0]}">But if we accept the Hanbali/Maliki Fiqhs as true Islam (i.e. marrying another person with the intention of marriage is not allowed), then it brings EVEN MORE harm to the woman, while in this case all the doors have been shut upon the woman to rejoin with his ex-husband. And her children will be separated from her, in any case, which is the biggest punishment for a mother. And children will also be greatly affected as they will lose their mother and their family life in this case.</li>
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[23461,23810,1,0]}">And as far as the presence of "Halala Centers" is concerned in Islamic and Western countries is concerned, then it may be stupid, but still desirable as they indeed help the poor mother and children in order to reunite. The absence of such Halala Centers will only make their lives more miserable.</li>
<li data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[23811,24172,1,0]}">Thus, when modern Islamic apologists bring this argument that marriage with the intention of divorce with the 2nd man is not allowed, then it does not serve as a DEFENCE for Islam, and it does not relieve it from this oppression and illogical ruling of Halala, but it proves only this that this Islamic Ruling is even more illogical and even more oppressing for divorced mothers, who lose their children for their entire lives.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The practice of Nikah Tahleel (Halala) is a direct consequence of erroneous Fiqh interpretations regarding the issuance of triple divorces in a single sitting <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="mw-ref" data-mw="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ref&quot;,&quot;body&quot;:{&quot;html&quot;:&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.muslimink.com/society/family/tahleel-marriage-and-triple-talaaq/\&quot; rel=\&quot;mw:ExtLink\&quot; class=\&quot;external text\&quot; data-parsoid=\&quot;{&amp;quot;targetOff&amp;quot;:25064,&amp;quot;contentOffsets&amp;quot;:[25064,25106],&amp;quot;dsr&amp;quot;:[24986,25107,78,1]}\&quot;&gt;Nikah Tahleel and 3 Talaqs in one sitting.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;}}" data-parsoid="{&quot;dsr&quot;:[24981,25113,5,6]}" data-ve-attributes="{&quot;typeof&quot;:&quot;mw:Extension/ref&quot;,&quot;rel&quot;:&quot;dc:references&quot;,&quot;about&quot;:&quot;#mwt178041983&quot;}"><a href="https://www.muslimink.com/society/family/tahleel-marriage-and-triple-talaaq/" data-ve-attributes="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;counter-reset: mw-Ref 10;&quot;}">[link]</a></sup>. For that, these Fiqhs are responsible and not Islam. Responsibility for this lies with Hanafi Fiqh, not with Islam itself. If the three Talaqs were pronounced over three separate instances (spanning three months), there would be no need for Halala, as the couple got enough time to think and resolve their disputes during those 3 months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this Salafi logic is flawed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Duration of Resolution</strong>: Can one guarantee that a marital dispute will reach resolution within a mere three months? Is it not plausible that more time may be needed for genuine reconciliation? Consider a scenario where a husband realizes his error and seeks reunion after a year. What provision is made for such cases? Restricting the issue within three menstrual cycles may not always align with the reality; sometimes individuals require a more extended period for comprehension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effect of Separation</strong>: Instances have demonstrated that temporary separation between partners can often lead to resolution. The partners, separated, may learn lessons through child rearing, emphasizing the value of their union. However, in the Islamic divorce process, the wife is compelled to remain in her husband's residence throughout the divorce period, which can last around three months. This system may fall short in facilitating lessons, particularly for husbands who are permitted to engage with other women and slaves during this interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extended Resolution Time</strong>: Human logic guides us that the pair should be given as much longer time as they wish/need to overcome their disputes and learn the lesson. This is always a much better option than any permanent separation in the name of Halala, which negatively affect not only the couple but also the children. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The matter of Triple Talaq extends beyond Hanafi jurisprudence; all four Sunni Fiqhs acknowledge the legitimacy of divorce arising from the pronouncement of triple divorces in one sitting.</li>
<li>The denial of Triple Talaq in Islam pertains only to a few later coming Zahiri scholars; for the vast majority of Islam's 1400-year history, both Triple Talaq and the ensuing Halala practice have persisted globally.</li>
<li>Even in the cases of three Talaqs in three menstrual cycles, numerous divorced women express the desire to reconcile with their former spouses, while it is the ONLY option for poor women to not lose the custody of their children and also have a support of a husband. Otherwise, if they remarry, then Islam snatches away their children from poor women. </li>

<p><strong>Protection Against Abuse</strong>: Robust safeguards are in place to shield women from abusive behavior by their spouses. Secular Western legal systems prioritize the safety and well-being of individuals facing such circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Recognition of Ongoing Emotions</strong>: Secular Western societies acknowledge that divorced individuals might continue to feel affection for their former spouses, underscoring the complexity of human emotions after divorce, without stigma.</p>

<p><strong>Consent and Resolution</strong>: The essence of mutual agreement is highly valued in secular Western legal frameworks. Conflict resolution between partners is encouraged through internal discussions and mutual consensus, reflecting a commitment to maintaining amicable relationships.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Empowerment in Dispute Resolution</strong>: The power to determine the timeline for resolving conflicts and achieving reconciliation is placed in the hands of the involved parties themselves. This empowerment fosters an environment of personal agency and choice.</p>

<h2>Summary:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad adopted the practice of 'Iddah from the pre-Islamic era.</li>
<li>He imposed unnecessary restrictions on women, unrelated to determining the parentage of the child.</li>
<li>Muhammad made scientific errors while enforcing 'Iddah rulings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Muslims argue that Allah granted women their rights with <strong>justice</strong>, while the secular Western world made a mistake by providing women with "<strong>equal</strong>" rights to men, oppressing them in the process. Let's examine the validity of this claim and assess whether Islam truly upholds <strong>justice</strong> for women.</p>

<p>The waiting period is becoming free of the first menstrual blood (i.e. 3 to 7 days in which she becomes free of her menstrual blood). After that, the new Muslim master can rape her. </p>
<p><strong>2. A widow woman: </strong></p>
<p>The waiting period is 4 months and 10 days.</p>
<p><strong>3. A pregnant woman: </strong></p>
<p>The waiting period is up to 9 months, lasting until the birth of the baby.</p>
<p><strong>4. A divorced woman: </strong></p>
<p>The waiting period is 3 menstrual cycles. During these cycles, she receives no attention, love, or emotional support from any man. The first 3 menstrual cycles constitute the divorce process, during which her husband does not have physical contact with her, while he remains permitted to engage with other wives and slave girls. After the divorce, she is subjected to another 3 menstrual cycles of waiting, amounting to, in total, about 6 months of practically solitary confinement.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ila <a href="https://islamqa.org/hanafi/askimam/126436/question-in-regards-to-ila/">(الإيلاء)</a></strong>:</p>
<p>This is another form of divorce in Islam. In this case, a man refrains from physical contact with his wife for 4 months, following which the divorce takes place. Nevertheless, the wife must still observe the waiting period of 3 menstrual cycles, resulting in about 7 months of practically solitary confinement-like situation.</p>
<p>These waiting periods differ for each category of women, and the length of time they have to wait and stay without the companionship of men varies accordingly.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId82861"></a>Muhammad copied this illogical practice of ‘Iddah from the pre-Islamic period of so-called Ignorance</h3>
<p>Muhammad copied this ‘Iddah from the culture of people of the Pre-Islamic period of ignorance.</p>
<p>Just check this logic of Muhammad for putting all these oppressive restrictions upon the woman in the name of ‘Iddah, where he told them not to make complaints against the Islamic Iddah, while they had to stay even for longer periods of time in ‘Iddah during the pre-Islamic days. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5336">Sahih Bukhari, Book of Divorce</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Um Salama said that a woman came to Allah's Messenger and said, "O Allah's Messenger ! The husband of my daughter has died and she is suffering from an eye disease. Can she apply collyrium/kohl to her eye?" Allah's Messenger replied, "No," twice or thrice. (Every time she repeated her question) he said, "No." <b>Then Allah's Messenger added, "It is just a matter of four months and ten days. In the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance, a widow among you should throw a globe of dung when one year has elapsed (i.e. she had to stay in ‘Iddah for the whole one year)."</b></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId205190"></a>Muslim Excuse: Longer ‘Iddah of 3 periods (or more) is necessary in order to ensure that the ‘parentage’ of the child is secure</h3>
<p>Islam apologists argue that 'Iddah is necessary to ensure the parentage of the child is secure. However, this excuse lacks logic and accuracy, as becoming free of the blood from the first menstrual cycle is sufficient to determine if a woman is pregnant and ascertain the parentage of the child.</p>
<p>Islam itself stipulates a shorter 'Iddah period, consisting of becoming free of the first menstrual blood (i.e. 3 to 7 days), for prisoner women, slave women, and free Muslim women who enter an Islamic State from a non-Muslim country. After this first menstrual cycle, Muslim men are allowed to have sexual relations with them.</p>
<p>For instance, Muhammad himself had sexual relations with Saffiyah on the same night her brother, and husband were killed, as she became free from the blood of her first menstrual blood on the same day (Reference: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221101074403/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;idfrom=4080&amp;idto=4081&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=1404">Sahih Bukhari</a>).</p>
<p>This demonstrates that the excuse of the child's paternity cannot be used for letting poor women suffer in the name of 'Iddah for 3 menstrual periods, where she cannot marry another man and has to face a lot of other unlogical "restrictions" which make her life difficult. </p>

<p>During 'Iddah, women not only have to endure long waiting periods but also face additional unnecessary and illogical restrictions imposed by Allah/Muhammad, making their lives more difficult and miserable.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId514374"></a>First Restriction: A woman has to undergo the 'Iddah even if she receives no maintenance money from her husband</h3>
<div class="quotes">Please see the following Fatwa:</div>
<div class="quotes">
<blockquote>The <b>maintenance and providing of shelter for a woman observing the Iddat of Death are not the responsibility of her in-laws. She also does not have the right to take her maintenance out of the Estate of her deceased husband.</b>

</div>
<p>As a result:</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman is obligated to undergo the 'Iddah period, which lasts for 4 months and 10 days (or up to 9 months in case of pregnancy). However, she has no entitlement to receive financial support from her husband's estate during this lengthy period of time.</li>
<li>Even if the husband was poor and left no money, the wife is still required to observe the waiting period. This places a significant financial burden on women, especially in Islamic countries where they often lack a source of income. Moreover, Islam restricts their ability to seek employment outside the home during this waiting period, making it even more challenging for them to sustain themselves financially. This situation is truly unfortunate.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId388740"></a>Second Restriction: She is obligated to stay exclusively in the house of her deceased husband during the 'Iddah period<span id="Second_Restriction:_She_has_to_obligatorily_stay_only_in_the_house_of_Husband_during_the_‘Iddah"></span></h3>
<p>As per Islamic Sharia'h, when a husband passes away:</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman is required to spend the entire duration of 'Iddah solely in the house of her late husband.</li>
<li>She is not permitted to stay at any other location, such as her parents' home or that of any other family members (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211028112250/https://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/45291/laws-of-the-iddat/">link1</a> and <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10670/what-a-recently-widowed-woman-is-not-allowed-to-do">link 2</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the problem lies in:</p>
<ul>
<li>What relevance does the location of her 'Iddah have with the parentage of her child?</li>
<li>Why is she not allowed to spend this waiting period in the comfort of her parent's house, where she is surrounded by people who love and care for her? Such a supportive environment could greatly assist her in coping with the sorrow of her husband's demise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Conversely, in her husband's house, she may feel isolated and confined, unable to leave the premises or interact with any men.

<blockquote>
<div class="quotes">Furay'ah said that she came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him whether she could return to her people, Banu Khidrah, for her husband went out seeking his slaves who ran away. When they met him at al-Qudum, they murdered him.
<p>So I asked the Messenger of Allah: "Should I return to my people, <b>for he did not leave any dwelling house of his own and maintenance for me</b>?</p>
<p>She said: The Messenger of Allah replied: Yes. She said: I came out, and when I was in the apartment or in the mosque, he called for me, or he commanded (someone to call me) and, therefore, I was called.</p>
<p>He said: what did you say? So I repeated my story which I had already mentioned about my husband.</p>
<p><b>Thereupon he said: Stay in your house till the term (of four months and 10 days) lapses.</b></p>
She said: So I passed my waiting period in it (her house) for four months and ten days. When Uthman ibn Affan became a caliph, he sent for me and asked me about that; so I informed him, <b>and he followed it and decided cases accordingly</b>.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The wife is obliged to continue residing in the house of her deceased husband, irrespective of whether the property belongs to her husband or not, and even if he hasn't left any financial provisions for her maintenance.</p>
<p>This requirement places an additional burden on the wife, as she may have no claim to the property or financial support, yet she is compelled to stay in the same dwelling where her husband lived. This can result in financial hardship and emotional distress for the widow, especially if she is left without any source of income or means of sustenance.</p>
<p>Moreover, w<span style="font-size: 1rem;">hy is she compelled to bear the expenses of her daily needs on her own, while her family could have taken care of her easily if she had stayed in the house of her parents/brothers/sisters?</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>She could also not go outside for daily walks, as they are not a necessity (<a class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211014114224/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/349861/woman-in-iddah-may-go-out-for-need" rel="nofollow">Fatwa 1</a>, <a class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211014114300/https://idealwoman.org/2021/can-a-woman-go-out-for-a-walk-during-iddat/" rel="nofollow">Fatwa 2</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, a woman observing iddat, whether due to divorce or widowhood, is strictly forbidden from leaving her home premises for any reason. This includes visiting friends or relatives, attending funerals, and even going for daily walks, as they are considered unnecessary activities during this period.</p>
<p>These restrictions raise important questions.</p>
<p>Women, like any human beings, have social and emotional needs. They also require leisure activities such as going to parks, taking daily walks, shopping, dining out, attending social gatherings, visiting their parents' homes, and meeting relatives. Subjecting women to these unilateral restrictions goes against human nature and raises concerns about gender justice. These draconian restrictions practically confine a woman to a solitary existence, adversely affecting her mental and emotional well-being.</p>

<p>Although a woman is allowed to take medical care during ‘Iddah, still she should not use collyrium/kohl as a cure even for any eye disease, while it beautifies her.</p>
<div class="quotes"><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/In-Book/Book-68/Hadith-81/">Sahih Bukhari 68:81</a>:</div>

<div class="quotes">It is important to note that during the 'Iddah period, the woman is already confined to her house, where there are no non-Mahram men present who can see her beauty.

<p>During the 'Iddah period, women are prohibited from wearing good clothes, jewellery, using perfume, applying Henna, combing their hair, and using oil or even washing their faces with aloe. These restrictions are in place even when the woman is confined to her home and not coming into contact with any non-Mahram men.</p>

Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani declared this Hadith to be FAIR (حسن).</div>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Islamic apologists, the rationale behind these restrictions is to maintain modesty and prevent any potential temptation or seduction during this so-called vulnerable period. However, the questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman is not coming into any kind of contact with any man during the 'iddah, as she is not allowed to let any non-Mahram man enter her house, and she is not allowed to leave the house.</li>
<li>So, what is wrong if she wears good clothes, and jewellery, uses perfume and uses henna and combs her hair with oil, and washes her face with aloe in the house, where she is alone, or at maximum with other women?</li>
<li>Who are these people that she’s gonna “seduce” to marry her? The walls?</li>
</ul>
<p>Normal Muslim women and virgin girls are allowed to go outside and participate in various activities without falling into sin. So, why would a divorced or widowed woman be any different in that they will commit a sin by doing these things?</p>
<p>Similarly, if other Muslim women can use Kohl, perfume, jewellery, and wear good clothes without indulging in sin, there is no reason to believe that a divorced/widowed woman would behave differently.</p>

<p>Islam advocates claim that the reason for the 4 months and 10 days long 'iddah of a widow is to '<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>M</strong><b>ourn</b></span>' the death of the husband (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/88684/rights-of-a-deceased-husband-on-his-wife">link</a>).</p>
<p>But the questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is there no obligation for any “mourning” (even for a single second) upon a man if his wife dies? He can marry another woman the same night. He can also have intimate relations with his other wives and slave girls the same night too.</li>
<li>Only a woman is compelled to ‘mourn’ the death of her husband. Only she is deprived of her natural need for love and intimacy in the name of ‘mourning,’ and only she has to undergo the strict restrictions of 'Iddah.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, a widow also has to observe 'Iddah, even if <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">(<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/145179/the-waiting-period-of-an-old-woman-after-the-death-of-her-husband">Link</a>)</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>She has never seen his husband after the marriage.</li>
<li>Or even if the marriage has not been consummated.</li>
<li>Or even if she is a minor child.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why should she mourn his death if she has no emotional connection and love for him in her heart? What if the deceased husband was abusive, and the widow harbors feelings of hatred towards him? In such cases, imposing a long waiting period with numerous restrictions is cruel and unnecessary.</p>
<p>Instead, Islam could have allowed widows to make their own decisions about mourning, the duration of 'iddah, and when they are ready for a new relationship. They should have the autonomy to choose where to stay and seek support from their families if needed. Women are capable of making their own choices regarding their personal lives and emotions.</p>

<p>According to the Quran, the waiting period for a pregnant woman is until the birth of a child (<a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/65.4" rel="nofollow">Quran 65:4</a>).</p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad further explained the <strong>scientific logic</strong> behind this Quranic order, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/AbuDawud/DarusSalam/Hadith-2158/">Sunan Abu Dawud 2158</a>:</p>
<div class="quotes">The Messenger of Allah said: It is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and the last day <b>to water what another has sown with his water (meaning intercourse with a woman who is pregnant from her previous husband).</b></div>
</blockquote>
<p>This practice by Muhammad/Allah reflects a scientific misunderstanding, as modern science has clarified that if a woman is already pregnant, another man's sperm will not affect the fetus. This concept was based on the beliefs of the times of ignorance, and Muhammad adopted it from them, leading to a scientific mistake.</p>
<p>Moreover, the pregnant woman is left to bear the consequences of this practice unilaterally. After the death of her husband, she becomes financially vulnerable, especially if the deceased husband left no money for her and the baby. It is nearly impossible for her to work outside while carrying the baby in her belly. Additionally, during pregnancy, a woman is emotionally sensitive and in need of support, yet she is compelled to stay at her deceased husband's house and endure all these difficulties alone until the birth of the baby.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a pregnant woman should not have to go through the 'Iddah period at all, as the parentage of the child is already known due to her pregnancy. If a husband can divorce a pregnant woman and engage in relationships with other women, it is unfair to deprive the pregnant woman of emotional support, love, attention, and care from a new partner during this challenging time when she needs it the most.</p>
<p>In response to the claims of Islamic apologists, it is important to note that any potential effects on the fetus would be positive. Sex with a man makes the mother happy, resulting in a positive impact on the fetus. There is no logical reason for Allah/Muhammad to oppose such positive effects on the mother and fetus.</p>
<p>Overall, this practice reflects a lack of understanding and consideration for the well-being of pregnant women and their children, and it raises important questions about the fairness and compassion within the teachings of Islam.</p>

<p>The problem is, t<span style="font-size: 1rem;">he whole process of Divorce + ‘Iddah lasts for <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>6 menstrual cycles</strong></span> for a divorced woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The whole process of 3 Talaqs in Islam consists of 3 menstrual cycles of a woman. This means, w</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">hen a Muslim husband initiates divorce, the woman is required to remain in the husband's house for the first <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3 menstrual cycles</strong></span> for the complete process of 3 Talaqs. Throughout this time, the wife and husband are to abstain from physical contact, effectively creating a state of 'solitary confinement' for the woman within the husband's residence. (</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://abukhadeejah.com/divorce-talaq-iddah-remarriage-khula/">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It's important to note that during these three months of the Talaq process, the wife is not allowed to have contact with any man, but the husband is free to engage in intimate relations with other wives or slave girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And after the 3 Talaqs process, she again has to undergo a waiting period of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3 MORE menstrual cycles</strong></span> in the name of 'Iddah (waiting period) (</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://www.islamic-sharia.org/downloads/talaq/">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">). Thus, in total she has to stay in a solitary confinement like situation for 6 months in total. </span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thus, there are double standards here:</p>
<ul>
<li>On one hand, Islamic apologists claim that Muslim women are not allowed to be wed during 3 periods/months long 'Iddah while she is mentally under stress after the divorce.</li>
<li>But on the other hand, they deny any such mental stress for the prisoner women and girls, and what to talk about divorce, but even after killing all the men of their family, Muslim men use them as sex object the same night. They are provided with no time to get out of their mental stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to Islam, Judaism and Christianity allowed the prisoner women to mourn their relatives for one complete month, during which men were not allowed to take any other sexual services from them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2021&amp;version=NIV">Bible, Deuteronomy, Chap 21</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="quotes"><b>Marrying a Captive Woman</b>
<p>(10) When you go to war against your enemies and the Lord your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives,</p>
<p>(11) if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife.</p>
<p>(12) Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails</p>
<p>(13) and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. <b>After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month</b>, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife.</p>
(14) If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her like a slave, since you have dishonored her.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad rejected the Sharia of Moses in this case, and he followed the laws of the pagan Arab society of that time, as it benefitted him and the Muslims financially and they were free to seek sexual pleasure through the prisoner women the same night.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId998564"></a>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>Is this the same so-called giving Rights with JUSTICE to women in Islam, which Muslims boast about in comparison to the Equal rights of women in the Western world? </p>
<p>All people with even the slightest intelligence can see that this is not called giving rights with Justice to women, but it is oppression against women and Injustice towards them. </p>

			<title>Strange Islam: A woman loses custody of her children if she REMARRIES</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/12-strange-islam-a-woman-loses-custody-of-her-children-if-she-remarries</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/12-strange-islam-a-woman-loses-custody-of-her-children-if-she-remarries</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>If a woman is a widow or divorced, then Islam makes her life a hell, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within Islamic societies, parental reluctance often restricts daughters from pursuing higher education.</li>
<li>Even if a woman manages to complete her education, societal norms frequently curtail her ability to practice her chosen profession, purportedly in the name of "modesty." This creates a paradox where she is expected to remain within the confines of her home, yet is simultaneously exposed to interactions with unrelated men if she ventures outside.</li>
<li>The prevailing sentiment emphasizes that her primary responsibility lies in caring for her children, often at the expense of her own professional aspirations.</li>
<li>The socio-cultural landscape in Islamic societies poses further obstacles for women seeking employment outside the home, as these environments are frequently dominated by men.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, when a woman becomes a widow or undergoes a divorce, she often finds herself in dire financial straits. In such cases, Islamic societies tend to view a divorced woman living independently with her children in a less favorable light, raising unjust doubts about her character.</p>
<p>Given these circumstances, the most viable solution for a widowed or divorced woman appears to be remarriage at the earliest opportunity. This choice offers financial support and serves as a defense against unwarranted gossip concerning her character.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">But sadly, Islam is such a worse religion for women, that it has also practically closed the door of remarriage for women, and it punishes her for this too. Islam compels the woman not to even think about remarriage, otherwise, her small children will be snatched away from her. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2276">Sunan Abi Dawud 2276</a>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span>A woman said: Messenger of Allah, my womb is a vessel to this son of mine, my breasts, a water-skin for him, and my lap a guard for him, yet his father has divorced me, and wants to take him away from me. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: You have more right to him as long as you do not marry.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the REASON for which she loses the custody of her children, is the most annoying issue. Please see the following two Fatwas (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210606140409/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/182019/why-a-wife-loses-custody-of-her-children-in-case-she-remarries">Fatwa 1</a> and <a title="Fatwa 2" href="https://darulifta-deoband.com/home/ur/talaq-divorce/19755">Fatwa 2</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is true that if the mother remarries, she loses the right of the custody of her children, and some scholars reported a consensus among the scholars on this issue ... <br>“This is because the child is harmed by the <strong>hatred of the 2nd husband</strong> who may get fed up with him <strong>and because the mother, by necessity, may neglect her child out of her desire to please her husband</strong> and her being preoccupied by him, and all this harms the child. This is why she loses the right of fostering.” <br>Moreover, An-Nawawi  from the Shaafi’e School of jurisprudence, said in “Al-Majmoo’”: <strong>“Because if she remarries, her (new) husband has the right to enjoy her (at all times) except at the time of worship (i.e. when she is performing an act of worship), so she cannot foster her children (form a previous marriage)</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These arguments, however, present significant shortcomings. They seem to perpetuate an assumption within Islam that stepfathers would invariably develop aversion towards their stepchildren, an assertion that was introduced when Muhammad excluded adopted children from familial bonds, subsequently extending this restriction to stepchildren as well. This perspective contradicts the essence of natural relationships and dismisses the potential for genuine emotional connections between parents and their adopted or stepchildren.</p>
<p>Similarly, the contention that a mother should be separated from her children due to concerns that she might neglect them in her pursuit of pleasing a new husband is deeply flawed. This viewpoint underestimates the innate nurturing instincts of mothers and the capacity of stepfathers to understand and support such relationships. Islam's stance on this matter contradicts the fundamental principles of natural relationships.</p>
<p>Moreover, Islam's assertion that a woman must be detached from her children in order to wholeheartedly fulfill the sexual demands of her new husband is particularly distressing. This notion portrays Islam as a religion that places the interests of men above the well-being of women and children, undermining the very essence of compassion and empathy that should underscore any spiritual belief.</p>
<p>In evaluating these perspectives, it becomes evident that Islam's teachings on these matters are incongruent with the natural order of human relationships. This misalignment underscores a troubling aspect of the religion's treatment of women and children, presenting a stark contradiction to the principles of compassion and equality that one would expect from a spiritual belief system.</p>
<h2>Muslims Challenge and Revise Islamic Sharia</h2>
<p>This particular tenet of Islamic Sharia, which mandates the separation of a mother from her children upon remarriage, while Allah (i.e. Muhammad) thinks that children from her first husband are a hindrance for a mother to provide her new husband with sex services, has been met with widespread criticism due to its inherent illogicality, cruelty, and injustice. In various Muslim nations today, Muslims themselves have taken a stand against this Sharia ruling. Utilizing their inherent rationality and common sense, they have chosen to discard this rule, opting instead to enact new laws within their Islamic societies. These revised laws reflect a more compassionate and reasonable approach, ensuring that mothers are not forcibly separated from their children if they choose to remarry. This progression exemplifies a conscious effort by Muslims to reevaluate and adapt certain aspects of their religious practices in pursuit of a more humane and equitable system.</p>
<h2>Double Standards of Islam: A non-Mahram guardian has more rights than the real mother + stepfather</h2>
<p>Islamic laws are against logic, and against nature, where it is ready to give a child in the guardianship of any non-Mahram man, but does not allow the real mother + stepfather to take care of the child.</p>
<p>Even worse, Islam also allowed that guardian, if he likes the beauty of his adoptive daughter, then he can take that small minor orphan girl in his Nikah (marriage) too. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.3">4:3</a>:<br>And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why Muhammad was forced to claim the revelation of this verse? The following tradition of ‘Aisha makes it clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5064">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5064</a>:<br>('Urwa narrated from ‘Aisha that she said about this verse 4:3) "O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her <strong>wealth and beauty</strong> and intends to marry her with a Mahr (i.e. money for dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Islam, a father (or guardian) is not needed to ask for consent from the minor girl child before giving her into Nikah of any man. Please read our detailed articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/71-islam-even-a-breastfed-baby-girl-can-be-married-and-used-for-sex">Islam: Even a breastfed baby Girl can be married and used for sexual pleasure</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/child-rape-in-islam/21-islam-a-foster-father-can-marry-his-adopted-minor-daughter">If got lust for the “minor adopted daughter” due to her beauty, then taking her into Nikah is “Halal Allah” and raping her is also “Halal Allah” for a Muslim Father</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these non-logical rulings of Islam against women, they are being blackmailed by their husbands. And women had to avoid divorce, despite their husbands being abusive, while in case of remarriage, their children are snatched away from them by Islam. </p>

			<title>The Unjust process of 3 Talaqs (Divorces) against woman in Islam </title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/7-the-unjust-process-of-3-talaqs-divorces-against-woman-in-islam</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/7-the-unjust-process-of-3-talaqs-divorces-against-woman-in-islam</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>ؐMuhammad copied the whole divorce system [like only men having the right to divorce, 3 Talaqs, <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/29-halala-tahleel-marriage">Halala (نكاح التحليل)</a>, <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/33-no-khul-خلع-for-a-woman-without-the-husband-s-consent">Khul’ خلع</a>, <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/31-‘iddah-waiting-period-is-illogical-injustice-against-women">‘Iddah (waiting period)</a>, <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/84-zihar-another-unjust-islamic-way-to-divorce-a-woman">Zihar (Divorce by Referring to Wife as Mother)</a>, <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/9-ila-الإيلاء-another-unjust-islamic-ruling-against-woman">Ila (الإيلاء)</a>] from the pre-Islamic Arab culture of the time of ignorance. </p>
<p>There are 2 ways of giving a divorce in Islam:</p>
<ul>
<li>When 3 Talaqs are given in 3 separate sittings (i.e. only one Talaq in one sitting).</li>
<li>When all 3 Talaqs are given in one sitting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Three Talaqs in 3 separate Sittings:</h2>
<p>This divorce procedure spans across three menstrual cycles. It's worth noting that during this three-month period, the wife is not permitted to leave the husband's residence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/65.1">65:1</a>: <br>O Prophet, when you [Muslims] divorce women, divorce them for [the commencement of] their waiting period and keep count of the waiting period, and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not turn them out of their [husbands'] houses, <strong>nor should they [themselves] leave [during that period] </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Islamic preachers argue that a woman is required to remain within her husband's home for the duration of three menstrual cycles during the 3 divorce process, allowing for a chance at reconciliation.</p>
<p>However, this logic is flawed, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if the husband is an abusive and malevolent individual? What if he subjects her to cruel treatment without any justification during this time? What if he inflicts severe beatings, causing her body to be covered in bruises? In such a case, why is the wife still mandated to endure three months with an abusive husband? (Please read our <a title="Khul'" href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Khul%27">Khul'</a> article, that a woman cannot get her freedom through Khul', even if the husband is abusive and tortures her. Only if he breaks any part of her body, in that case, she can get her freedom through the court)</li>
<li>Only the woman is forced to sacrifice in the name of so-called “reconcilement” in this Islamic Talaq process, while the husband has to bring no sacrifice. <strong>He is free to have sex with all other wives and slave girls during this whole period of 3 months.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any assurance that the discord between husband and wife will be resolved within the three-month Talaq process?</li>
<li>Is it not plausible that it might take more than three months for both parties to reconsider and end the conflict? For instance, a man may come to his senses after a year, realizing that divorcing his wife was a mistake and that she was blameless. What avenues are available then to rectify this error? The answer is, there are NO options available; she cannot return to him without undergoing the shameful process of <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/29-halala-tahleel-marriage">Halala ( نكاح التحليل)</a>, (where the woman is practically forced to let herself raped by 2nd husband, against her wishes). So, what is the "Divine Wisdom" in this ruling that confines the reconciliation period to a mere three menstrual cycles?</li>
</ul>
<p>The truth is, there is absolutely no Divine Wisdom present in it, but Muhammad simply copied the old custom of his Arab culture. The pagan Arabs of the time of Jahiliyyah (Ignorance) practised the system of 3 Talaqs and Halala, and thus Muhammad also followed them. In simple words, the Wisdom of Allah is EQUAL to the Wisdom of the pagans of the time of Jahiliyyah in this case of the 3 Talaqs system and Halala. </p>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Islam mandates the wife to remain within her husband's home throughout the Talaq process. However, it's been observed that during disputes, living separately for a period could be beneficial.</li>
<li>This separation offers both parties a chance to reflect on their mistakes, leading to better insights and understanding. When the wife experiences the difficulties of living with her parents or siblings, she quickly appreciates the value of her husband's home. Likewise, when the husband shoulders all responsibilities in the household and cares for the children on his own, he gains a deeper understanding of his errors.</li>
<li>Yet, Islam denies them this option by instructing the woman not to leave her husband's residence even in the face of significant conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Declaring three divorces in a single instance is not only illogical but also unfair to women</h3>
<p>Islam advocates argue that Islam permits the issuance of three divorces in one sitting, relieving women from undergoing a three-month-long divorce procedure. However, the problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>This privilege is exclusively granted to men; a stark double standard. Are women really incapable of making decisions about their own lives, and they are mere 'emotionally driven beings' unable to navigate their own destiny?</li>
<li>Additionally, these divorces remain valid even if the wife is entirely blameless, with the husband pronouncing the triple divorce in a fit of ANGER. This disproves the notion that only women are prone to emotional instability; men, too, can succumb to extreme emotional turbulence, particularly in states of anger, resulting in impulsive and irrational actions, even to the extent of harming others.</li>
<li>One must question the rationale behind granting emotionally volatile men the authority to instantly divorce their wives by uttering 'Talaq' (divorce) thrice in a matter of seconds. What manner of Divine Wisdom is at play here?</li>
<li>Such a provision poses significant repercussions for the innocent wife, often leading to the dismantling of her entire family unit, and in the worst cases, even separation from her children.</li>
<li>Strikingly, despite her innocence, she alone bears the burden of the humiliating 'Halala' process, should she wish to reunite with her family (husband and children). Is this truly an equitable representation of justice for women according to Islamic principles?</li>
</ul>
<p>Muhammad himself separated a woman from his husband, after her husband divorced her 3 times through his agent in one sitting. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1480a">Sahih Muslim 1480a</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Fatima bint Qais reported that Abu 'Amr b. Hafs divorced her <span style="color: rgb(224, 62, 45);"><strong>absolutely</strong></span> (<strong>Arabic: </strong><span><strong>طَلَّقَهَا الْبَتَّةَ, which means 3 Talaqs</strong>)</span> when he was away from home, and he sent his agent to her with some barley. She was displeased with him and when he said: I swear by Allah that you have no claim on us. she went to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and mentioned that to him. He said: There is no maintenance due to you from him ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Muslims today argue that Islamic divorce should occur over three separate sittings, suggesting that the practice of issuing three divorces in a single sitting was an innovation (Bidah) introduced by Umar Ibn Khattab. However, they may want to consider the hadith where Muhammad himself acknowledged and confirmed the validity of three divorces pronounced in one sitting. This account calls for a closer examination of early practices and interpretations surrounding divorce in Islam.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Islam_Critics:_Blackmailing_the_women_in_name_of_‘reconcilement_&amp;_settlement’_in_the_Divorce_Process"></span><span id="Islam_Critics:_Blackmailing_the_women_in_name_of_.E2.80.98reconcilement_.26_settlement.E2.80.99_in_the_Divorce_Process" class="mw-headline">Blackmailing Women in the name of ‘Reconcilement &amp; Settlement’ through the THREAT of Divorce</span></h2>
<p>While Islam gives only men the full right to divorce their wives (even without giving any reason), thus it works as a weapon in the hands of an abusive husband, to blackmail her unjustly, and to usurp her rights by compelling her to give up her rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="quotes"><a href="https://quranx.com/4.128?context=3">Quran 4:128-129</a>:</div>
<div class="quotes">And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of <b>settlement</b> between them (i.e. woman agrees upon leaving some of her rights) … And you will never be able to do <b>Justice (Arabic: تَعْدِلُوْا)</b> between wives, even if you should strive [to do so].</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Here occurs a contradiction in Islamic Sharia, while earlier at the time of allowing 4 wives, the writer of the Quran stipulated the condition of "Justice (Adl عدل)":</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="quotes"><a href="https://quranx.com/4.3?Context=3">Quran 4:3</a>:</div>
<div class="quotes">If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal <b>JUSTLY (Arabic: تَعْدِلُوا۟)</b> with them, then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This exposes a paradox within Islamic Sharia: while the Quran earlier emphasized the principle of "justice" (Adl عدل) when discussing polygamy (Quran 4:3), it later permits husbands to employ the threat of divorce, along with contempt and avoidance, as a means to manipulate their wives into conceding their rights under the guise of a settlement. This effectively sets aside the imperative of justice, with settlements consistently favoring husbands who retain control over the divorce process.</p>
<p>Notably, even the founder of Islam, Muhammad, resorted to such tactics. For instance, he employed the threat of Talaq against his wife Sawdah (without giving any reason), who happened to be older than his other young wives. The issue was, Muhammad had to spend one night with all his wives justly. But Muhammad didn't want to waste his time and a night with old Sawda in the presence of other younger and beautiful wives. </p>
<p>Overwhelmed with emotion, Sawdah told Muhammad that she was willing to step aside for 'Aisha in the rotation of wives. She implored Muhammad not to render her homeless through divorce during her advanced age. Despite Sawdah's loyal service and blameless conduct, she found herself compelled to sacrifice her rights in the name of a dubious 'settlement'.</p>
<p>In essence, the current application of the divorce process exploits women, coercing them into relinquishing their rightful claims through manipulative settlement tactics, often depriving them of justice and dignity.</p>
<h2>BBC Report: Many women, who are orally divorced 3 times in one sitting in Pakistan, finding difficult to prove it</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/urdu/articles/cgr13qjzv6no">Link</a>. </p>
<p>These poor women are now trying to seek justice from the courts for several years, but still getting no success. These women are suffering, while they firmly believe that they have been indeed divorced according to the law of Allah (i.e. their husbands said 3 times Talaq in anger, but later they denied doing it).</p>
<p>Thus, these poor women believe they should not stay under one roof with their husbands, as it will only be Zina. </p>

			<title>Issues with Islamic Faskh فسخ (dissolution of marriage)</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/6-evils-of-islamic-faskh-%D9%81%D8%B3%D8%AE-i-e-dissolution-of-marriage</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-and-divorce/6-evils-of-islamic-faskh-%D9%81%D8%B3%D8%AE-i-e-dissolution-of-marriage</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<h2>The Background Story (Very Important):</h2>
<p>Islam fully allows husbands to exploit and abuse their wives by beating them brutally (even with bruises). And poor wives have no right to seek divorce in Islamic court on the basis of this beating and abuse. They cannot even get their freedom through Khul' (خلع), which is again the right of a husband in Islam. </p>
<p>Yes, Islam has left no ESCAPE possible for poor women from this abuse. Islam makes them to endure this misery for their entire lives. </p>
<p>And when Islam is criticized for this injustice against women, then Islamic apologists come with an excuse that women can indeed escape their abusive husbands through FASKH in Islamic courts. </p>
<p>However, these Islamic apologists are only telling a lie, while: </p>
<ul>
<li>Faskh is an avenue that remains applicable only in a limited number of specific scenarios, such as cases of impotence, non-payment of maintenance, mental instability, or the husband's untraceable status.</li>
<li>A woman has no right to get divorce through Faskh in cases where a husband beats her brutally, as this beating is a right which is given to him by Allah. Similarly, an Islamic court cannot grant her divorce if she has to suffer in ILA at the hands of her husband. </li>
</ul>
<p>As an illustrative case, the <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_Muslim_Marriages_Act,_1939" rel="nofollow">'Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939'</a> can serve as a study in relation to these laws. This law, formulated by Muslim scholars in the Indian subcontinent, subsequently gained official status in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and functioned as the Personal Law for Indian Muslims.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_Muslim_Marriages_Act,_1939">Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="quotes"><b>Grounds for divorce</b>
<p>Under the act a woman married under Muslim Law shall be entitled to obtain a decree for the dissolution of her marriage on any one or more of the following grounds,[1]</p>
<p>(i) that the whereabouts of the husband have not been known for a period of <b>four years;</b></p>
<p>(ii) that the husband has neglected or has failed to provide for her maintenance for a period of <b>two years;</b></p>
<p>(iii) that the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment for a period of <b>seven years</b> or upwards;</p>
<p>(iv) that the husband has failed to perform, without reasonable cause his marital obligations for a period of <b>three years;</b> continues to be so:</p>
<p>(v) that the husband was impotent at the time of the marriage and</p>
<p>(vi) that the husband has been insane for a period of <b>two years</b> or is suffering from leprosy or a virulent venereal disease;</p>
(vii) that she, having been given in marriage by her father or other guardian before she attained the age of fifteen years, repudiated the marriage before attaining the age of eighteen years: <b>Provided that the marriage has not been consummated</b> (<i>i.e. if the husband has slept with her before she becomes 18 years old, then she will lose her right to get divorce</i>);</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Key Observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>While the law grants women the right to seek divorce under specific circumstances, the process's duration is excessively prolonged, compelling the woman to endure the ordeal alone.</li>
<li>It is noteworthy that 'Faskh' does not encompass instances of physical abuse, even involving visible injuries. Consequently, a wife enduring abuse cannot attain freedom from an abusive husband through Islamic court intervention via 'Faskh.' For further insights, our article titled"<a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-general/20-brutal-wife-beating-in-islam-recommendation-vs-actual-law">Wife Beating (Recommendation vs Law): Muhammad Recommended Beating Her Only Lightly, but He Made a Law That the Husband Can Beat Her Brutally Too, Even with Bruises</a>" provides detailed information.</li>
<li>Furthermore, juxtaposed with women's circumstances, husbands possess the privilege to immediately divorce their wives for reasons like infertility, mental instability, leprosy, perceived marital dissatisfaction, or even without providing any rationale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that Islamic Sharia allows a husband to slap his wife or to beat her brutally with bruises. On this basis, a woman is not allowed to get a divorce through Faskh in any Islamic court. Nevertheless, if the husband breaks any part of her body, only then she can get a separation through Khul'. This means she still has to pay him "ransom money" for her freedom. We request all to please read this important article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/33-no-khul-خلع-for-a-woman-without-the-husband-s-consent">Khul’ خلع (i.e. getting freedom from husband) is not a “right” of a woman, but it is still a “right” of a husband to either grant it or deny it</a></p>

			<title>No right to Divorce for Woman even if Husband doesn't do sex for years</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In Islam, the wife is like a prisoner, and Islam closed all the doors upon her in order to get her freedom from an evil husband. Even if her husband is a psychopath, and beats her brutally with bruises. Or even if he imprisons her in the house and neither lets her go out nor lets others enter his house. Or even if he tortures her mentally too along with physical torture. </p>
<p>The next step of Islam in this direction is where it allowed such psychopath husbands to not only imprison them in the house, but also not to show any kindness or affection towards them, and not to do any intercourse with them for several years (in order to torture them mentally). </p>
<p>Such psychopath husbands only have to pay the maintenance money, and after that, no Islamic court helps poor women to get rid of such psychopaths and get their freedom.</p>
<p>Fatwa from Dar-ul-Ifta Deoband (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220312103454/https://darulifta-deoband.com/home/en/Nikah-Marriage/3669">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Question:</u>If husband and wife do not do sex, in how many days their Nikah will be broken?<br>Answer:<br><em>Nikah</em> does not break by not doing intercourse, even if they do not have sex the whole of their life, but by doing so the husband will be violating her due rights. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are traditions that prior to the caliphate of Umar, Muslim warriors stayed away from their wives for long periods of time (maybe years). But when Umar became caliph, he consulted his daughter Hafsa and asked her how long a wife could stay without her husband. And she told it may be 4 months to 6 months. After that, Umar was the first one who stipulated that Muslim warriors should not be sent to the fronts for so long that they were separated from their wives for more than 6 months (Reference: <a href="https://askimam.org/public/question_detail/24021">Mufti Ebrahim Desai</a>)</p>
<p>Please also remember, despite the recommendation by Umar about 6 months, still it is not a part of Islamic Sharia, while it was only Muhammad who was allowed to tell if Allah made something a part of Sharia or not. </p>
<h2>Blackmailing the wives by showing ill-treatment and aversion towards them</h2>
<p>Please remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muslim Husbands can use these tactics in order to compel their wives to accept all of their demands, even if they are unjust. </li>
<li>Muhammad/Allah already practically 'abrogated' verse <a href="https://quranx.com/4.3">4:3</a> of doing 'Adl (Justice)' with the wives. </li>
<li>And the new verse <a href="https://quranx.com/4.128?context=3">4:128-129</a> is a license for husbands to show aversion, ill-treatment and desertion towards their wives, and thus compel them to give away their rights in name of the settlement. And the reason for this license is that men are not able to do 'Adl (justice) with them, even if they try to do it. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.128?context=3">4:128-129</a>) And if a woman fears from her husband <strong>contempt</strong> or <strong>evasion</strong>, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of <strong>settlement</strong> between them (i.e. woman agrees upon leaving some of her rights) … <strong>And you will never be able to do Justice (Arabic: تَعْدِلُوْا) between wives, even if you should strive [to do so]</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Difference from <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-divorce/118-why-is-the-rate-of-suicide-higher-in-the-atheist-community">Ila (الإيلاء)</a>:</h2>
<p>In Ila (الإيلاء), a man 'swears' to Allah that he will not do intercourse with his wife for 4 months. Therefore, after 4 months, a woman gets her freedom through a divorce. </p>
<p>While, if a Muslim man does not swear to Allah, then he is free to tease and punish the woman for an unlimited period of time, and she will not be able to get her freedom in any way. </p>
<p>Actually, in Ila (الإيلاء) too, a man could punish his wife for an unlimited period of time. He only has to break his swear once before the end of 4 months and rape his wife. And after that, he could again start with the new Ila for another 4 months. The atonement of breaking swear is also minimal i.e. fasting for 3 days, or feeding 10 poor people. </p>

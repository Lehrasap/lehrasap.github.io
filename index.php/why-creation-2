&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the underlying &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Motivation &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;behind Allah's decision to CREATE the universe in the first place? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;worship&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; describe only &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;AFTER &lt;/span&gt;the creation&lt;/strong&gt;, and they absolutely don't tell about the &lt;strong&gt;reason&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;motivation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEHIND &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;the creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, people were constantly asking Muhammad what was the motivation &lt;strong&gt;behind &lt;/strong&gt;Allah's decision to create the universe and humans in the first place. Allah (i.e. Muhammad) tried to answer this question in the Quran, where he said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/51.56&quot;&gt;51:56&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not created the jinns and mankind except to worship Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this Quranic answer received severe criticism, i.e. :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not answer the actual question i.e. what was the &lt;strong&gt;reason&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;motivation&lt;/strong&gt; behind creation, but it merely tells about the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;task&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTER &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;we had already been created. Allah/Muhammad failed completely to answer this core question. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, it's illogical for Allah to &quot;wish&quot; for worship from lowly creatures such as humans, whom He Himself created. When an entity begins to &quot;wish&quot; or demand worship, it forfeits the attribute of al-Samad (ٱلصَّمَدُ: Eternally-Self-Sufficient/Independent-of-All) and cannot be considered a God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran claimed: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/11.2&quot;&gt;11:2&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‏ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ ‎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Allah, the Eternally-Self-Sufficient/Independent-of-All (Himself in no need of anything)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when an entity starts to wish/demand worshipping and praise, it suggests a need, introducing &lt;strong&gt;an element of necessity&lt;/strong&gt;. This contradicts the essence of an all-powerful being, as such a being &lt;strong&gt;wouldn't require anything;&lt;/strong&gt; no worship, no acknowledgement of its existence, no prayers, no fasting month, and so forth. Consequently, this being &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; maintain the attribute of al-Samad (ٱلصَّمَدُ), indicating eternal self-sufficiency and independence from all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this criticism, Islamic preachers tried to cover it up with the excuse that:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic Scholars say that Almighty is not in the need of our worships .. but our prayers are there only to benefit us and to bring us to paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is apparent that the statement of Islamic scholars again fails to answer these core questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not worship, what was then the &lt;strong&gt;Reason/MOTIVATION&lt;/strong&gt; behind Allah's decision to CREATE the universe in the first place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, if not worship, what was then the &lt;strong&gt;Reason/MOTIVATION&lt;/strong&gt; behind Allah's choice to put humans (or any other creature) to the TEST?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined conclusion drawn from Quranic verse 51:56 and the assertion by Islamic scholars leads to a paradoxical scenario: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allah created jinns and mankind solely for worship, despite not requiring worship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;This juxtaposition lacks coherence and logic, akin to Allah proclaiming&lt;/span&gt;, &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am eating food, although I do not need food&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&quot; or &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am sleeping, although I do not need sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the lingering question remains there: if Allah does not necessitate our worship, then why did He create the universe and us without our consent in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core question of &quot;Why Test?&quot; bears similarities to the broader inquiry of &quot;Why Creation?&quot; This topic has proven challenging for Islamic scholars and apologists to explain, as it calls into question the&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; underlying motivation behind Allah's choice to TEST His creation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this question is posed, Islamic apologists often respond with a familiar refrain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mankind was created to pass the TEST.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this response doesn't address the core question: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #1000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did Allah decide to TEST mankind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a decision that necessitated their CREATION in the first place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the notion of a &quot;test&quot; primarily relates to tasks that humanity must undertake &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; they have already been created. Consequently, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;the concept of a test doesn't inherently provide a reason or justification for the initial act of CREATION itself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Islamists have to openly accept that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allah neither told the underlying reason/motivation for the TEST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nor did Allah tell the reason for not telling it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why a Test of PRAISING Allah? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could have understood i&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;f &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;a Test consisted of helping Humanity and doing good deeds and avoiding evils.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why a Test of worshipping and praising Allah 5 times a day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this &quot;Worship and Praise Syndrome&quot; extends beyond humans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider angels—they've been engaged in worshipping and praising Allah for nearly eternity, despite gaining no benefit from it, nor are they destined for paradise. Why does Allah demand their constant worship and praise? Yes, Islamists come up with the same lame excuse that Allah does not need worship and praise from angels, but it is the same as if Allah says: &quot;I am eating food, although I don't need food&quot;, or if Allah says: &quot;I am sleeping, although I don't need sleep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't stop with angels. According to Islam, all creatures, from animals and insects to celestial bodies like the moon, sun, and stars, as well as mountains and each and every particle in the universe is worshipping and praising Allah incessantly. &lt;span&gt;Yet, this devotion will not benefit them, as none of these entities will enter paradise and have 72 houris.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't Allah's insistence on being worshipped and praised 24 hours suggest &lt;strong&gt;narcissism&lt;/strong&gt;, indicating a self-centered motive for creating humankind and the universe to praise him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man has created Allah, which is why human weaknesses are also found in Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Allah gain from the constant praises of angels, animals, birds, and even every particle in the universe? You might say that Allah gains nothing from it... But then it's again like Allah saying that He is &quot;sleeping&quot; although He doesn't need to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Allah is Eternal, Why Did He Create the Universe Only 13.8 Billion Years Ago?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be speculated that Allah existed eternally but, for some reason, became exceedingly bored only around 13.8 billion years ago? As a result, it motivated him to create a game featuring two characters: mankind and Satan, and now Allah takes pleasure in their dramas as a means to alleviate His boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Allah show concern specifically for our Earth in this vast universe, and even more specifically for mankind, who supposedly arrived on Earth only a couple of thousand years ago (i.e. Adam and Eve)? The fossils of dinosaurs are 65 million years old, but of modern humans, they are hardly 300 thousand years old. And according to the Bible and some Islamic traditions, Adam came only about 6 to 7 thousand years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islam-general/69-adam-the-first-human-allegedly-came-only-6000-years-ago-according-to-islamic-traditions&quot;&gt;Link 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/scientific-mistakes-in-the-revelation/73-why-did-the-offspring-of-adam-stay-in-the-stone-age-for-290-thousand-years-according-to-islam&quot;&gt;Link 2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this vast universe, why would Allah be concerned about our individual homes and bedrooms, monitoring us even there to see what we are doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our galaxy alone, the Milky Way, there are billions of stars, each potentially hosting planets like Earth. The universe itself contains billions of galaxies. Why create such a vast, complex cosmos if the focus is on Earth and its relatively recent human inhabitants? What's more, the Hadiths suggest that the Mahdi is expected to arrive soon to end humanity's dominance by non-Muslims. When the Mahdi comes, instead of exploring space and using spaceships to explore this immense universe, he is prophesied to engage in violent conflict and ultimately lead to the end of the world. The heavens will collapse onto Earth, and the entire universe will be destroyed. This narrative feels narrow and Earth-centric, failing to account for the enormous scale of the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the question persists: What is the purpose behind the creation of such a vast universe, where numerous stars (that are even bigger than Earth) are destroying every day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous signs of the last hours, yet none of them mention humans reaching the moon, sun, or other stars, let alone acknowledging the existence of space. Why would the Buraq, the mule-like creature purportedly used by Muhammad for his ascension journey, need wings to navigate space? If it were capable of flying in space without wings, it could surely do so in our earthly atmosphere as well. Additionally, the Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/35.1&quot;&gt;verse 35:1&lt;/a&gt;) states that angels fly in the heavens with 2, 3, or 4 wings. Do any of these assertions make logical sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these considerations lead one to question whether this god is a creation of human imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was the purpose of creating insects, who have no conscious?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, humans had consciousness, but what was the purpose of creating millions of types of insects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran says that not only humans but even ants have consciousness (the story of King Solomon's army). In principle, after gaining consciousness, they should also be divided into heaven and hell. At the very least, the snake that bit Abu Bakr in the cave should be thrown into the fire of hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what was the purpose of the creation of dinosaurs who came 65 million years ago before arrival of humans on this earth? Moreover, what was the purpose of the creation of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other hominids, who all died before modern Humans? The answer is impossible because when the Quran and Muhammad were unaware of Neanderthals, how can Muslims give an answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the purpose of eternal life in heaven?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, religious people give the same old answer that the purpose of this life is to prepare for the eternal life to come, to see who succeeds and goes to heaven and who fails and ends up in hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear religious friends! Have you ever thought about what the purpose of that infinite life will be? In this short life, eating, drinking, wearing clothes, and helping others is considered materialism by you, and in response, you claim that the purpose of our life is the eternal life where the same eating, drinking, and eternal luxury won't be materialism? If you don't understand the purpose of that eternal life and have never been told about it, why deceive yourself by defining the purpose of this short life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the purpose of Allah's infinite life?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can think a bit further, consider this: the God of religions that question the purpose of our short life has been alive from eternity and will live forever. Has this God ever defined a purpose for His infinite life? Was the purpose of the life of a God with infinite powers and immense benevolence to create a world where the powerful have always oppressed the weak? Was the purpose of this God's life to continually kill His own creation through famine, earthquakes, storms, and floods? Is the purpose of this God's life just to see who passes the test of this insignificant world and who goes to heaven or hell? If only this God could have defined a purpose for His infinite life before determining the purpose of our short lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamist's Argument&lt;/strong&gt;: Our Parents also gave birth to us without asking us first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a significant difference between human parents and Allah. Human parents are subject to natural forces, societal pressures, and personal needs. To cope with the challenges of life, they may feel a wish, or even feel compelled to have children. Additionally, some parents fear the isolation that can come with aging, and they seek companionship through family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims believe that Allah, however, is &quot;al-Samad,&quot; which means He is self-sufficient and not in need of anything. If Allah starts &quot;desiring&quot; something, it would suggest dependency or incompleteness, contradicting the concept of being &quot;al-Samad.&quot; Thus, the motivation behind human parents' decision to have children is understandable. In contrast, Allah's reasons/motivation for creating the universe and humanity remain completely unanswered (both by Allah and by Muslims too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these differences, the comparison between the motivations of human parents and Allah does not hold. While human parents may create life to fulfill personal needs, but it is claimed by Muslims that Allah is free of any personal needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamist's Argumen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;: Allah does not need to tell us why He created us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, Islamic apologists come up with the following two excuses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allah does not need to tell us why He created us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And even if Allah told it, we could not comprehend it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, at least Islamic apologists admit openly that God neither told us about the underlying motivation for creation nor He told the reason for not telling it to us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if Allah expects us to use our intellect to recognize Him, then He must be prepared to address our genuine and honest questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's contradictory to &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; our intellect first to find Allah, only to later &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;abuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; our intellect by telling us that our intellect cannot grasp His motives for creating the universe. This approach undermines the very intellect that he encourages us to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, here's the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allah hasn't provided an explanation for the purpose behind creation or the test that comes with life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This can lead to various interpretations, including the notion that there exists no Allah in the heavens at all, and Muhammad was creating the revelations on his own. Given Muhammad's limited perspective as a human being, he had no ability to answer the question regarding the reason/motivation behind creation and test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Qur'an indeed tried to answer this question that humans and jinns were created to worship Allah, but this assertion met with severe criticism. Why would an all-sufficient God, who is supposed to be &quot;al-Samad,&quot; need worship and praise from His own creations? If He is self-sufficient, He shouldn't desire or need any form of adulation or recognition from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, if a God seeks intellectual engagement with humanity, it's only logical to expect clear and concise answers to fundamental questions. Without such clarity, every Tom, Dick and Harry can claim that their gods created humans for the sole purpose of worshipping and praising them, rendering the claims indistinguishable and unsubstantiated. There is no discernible difference between Muhammad's claims about Allah and the claims of others about their gods - all lack concrete evidence to support their assertions. This lack of proof renders all claims equally dubious and unverifiable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Please differentiate between the following 2 issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the underlying &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Motivation &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;behind Allah's decision to CREATE the universe in the first place? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;worship&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; describe only &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;AFTER &lt;/span&gt;the creation&lt;/strong&gt;, and they absolutely don't tell about the &lt;strong&gt;reason&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;motivation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEHIND &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;the creation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core question of &quot;Why Test?&quot; bears similarities to the broader inquiry of &quot;Why Creation?&quot; This topic has proven challenging for Islamic scholars and apologists to explain, as it calls into question the&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; underlying motivation behind Allah's choice to TEST His creation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this question is posed, Islamic apologists often respond with a familiar refrain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mankind was created to pass the TEST.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this response doesn't address the core question: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #1000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did Allah decide to TEST mankind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a decision that necessitated their CREATION in the first place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the notion of a &quot;test&quot; primarily relates to tasks that humanity must undertake &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; they have already been created. Consequently, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;the concept of a test doesn't inherently provide a reason or justification for the initial act of CREATION itself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Islamists have to openly accept that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allah neither told the underlying reason/motivation for the TEST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nor did Allah tell the reason for not telling it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why a Test of PRAISING Allah? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could have understood i&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;f &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;a Test consisted of helping Humanity and doing good deeds and avoiding evils.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why a Test of worshipping and praising Allah 5 times a day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this &quot;Worship and Praise Syndrome&quot; extends beyond humans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider angels—they've been engaged in worshipping and praising Allah for nearly eternity, despite gaining no benefit from it, nor are they destined for paradise. Why does Allah demand their constant worship and praise? Yes, Islamists come up with the same lame excuse that Allah does not need worship and praise from angels, but it is the same as if Allah says: &quot;I am eating food, although I don't need food&quot;, or if Allah says: &quot;I am sleeping, although I don't need sleep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't stop with angels. According to Islam, all creatures, from animals and insects to celestial bodies like the moon, sun, and stars, as well as mountains and each and every particle in the universe is worshipping and praising Allah incessantly. &lt;span&gt;Yet, this devotion will not benefit them, as none of these entities will enter paradise and have 72 houris.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't Allah's insistence on being worshipped and praised 24 hours suggest &lt;strong&gt;narcissism&lt;/strong&gt;, indicating a self-centered motive for creating humankind and the universe to praise him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man has created Allah, which is why human weaknesses are also found in Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Allah gain from the constant praises of angels, animals, birds, and even every particle in the universe? You might say that Allah gains nothing from it... But then it's again like Allah saying that He is &quot;sleeping&quot; although He doesn't need to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Allah is Eternal, Why Did He Create the Universe Only 13.8 Billion Years Ago?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be speculated that Allah existed eternally but, for some reason, became exceedingly bored only around 13.8 billion years ago? As a result, it motivated him to create a game featuring two characters: mankind and Satan, and now Allah takes pleasure in their dramas as a means to alleviate His boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Allah show concern specifically for our Earth in this vast universe, and even more specifically for mankind, who supposedly arrived on Earth only a couple of thousand years ago (i.e. Adam and Eve)? The fossils of dinosaurs are 65 million years old, but of modern humans, they are hardly 300 thousand years old. And according to the Bible and some Islamic traditions, Adam came only about 6 to 7 thousand years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islam-general/69-adam-the-first-human-allegedly-came-only-6000-years-ago-according-to-islamic-traditions&quot;&gt;Link 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/scientific-mistakes-in-the-revelation/73-why-did-the-offspring-of-adam-stay-in-the-stone-age-for-290-thousand-years-according-to-islam&quot;&gt;Link 2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this vast universe, why would Allah be concerned about our individual homes and bedrooms, monitoring us even there to see what we are doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our galaxy alone, the Milky Way, there are billions of stars, each potentially hosting planets like Earth. The universe itself contains billions of galaxies. Why create such a vast, complex cosmos if the focus is on Earth and its relatively recent human inhabitants? What's more, the Hadiths suggest that the Mahdi is expected to arrive soon to end humanity's dominance by non-Muslims. When the Mahdi comes, instead of exploring space and using spaceships to explore this immense universe, he is prophesied to engage in violent conflict and ultimately lead to the end of the world. The heavens will collapse onto Earth, and the entire universe will be destroyed. This narrative feels narrow and Earth-centric, failing to account for the enormous scale of the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the question persists: What is the purpose behind the creation of such a vast universe, where numerous stars (that are even bigger than Earth) are destroying every day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous signs of the last hours, yet none of them mention humans reaching the moon, sun, or other stars, let alone acknowledging the existence of space. Why would the Buraq, the mule-like creature purportedly used by Muhammad for his ascension journey, need wings to navigate space? If it were capable of flying in space without wings, it could surely do so in our earthly atmosphere as well. Additionally, the Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/35.1&quot;&gt;verse 35:1&lt;/a&gt;) states that angels fly in the heavens with 2, 3, or 4 wings. Do any of these assertions make logical sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these considerations lead one to question whether this god is a creation of human imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was the purpose of creating insects, who have no conscious?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, humans had consciousness, but what was the purpose of creating millions of types of insects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran says that not only humans but even ants have consciousness (the story of King Solomon's army). In principle, after gaining consciousness, they should also be divided into heaven and hell. At the very least, the snake that bit Abu Bakr in the cave should be thrown into the fire of hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what was the purpose of the creation of dinosaurs who came 65 million years ago before arrival of humans on this earth? Moreover, what was the purpose of the creation of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other hominids, who all died before modern Humans? The answer is impossible because when the Quran and Muhammad were unaware of Neanderthals, how can Muslims give an answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the purpose of eternal life in heaven?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, religious people give the same old answer that the purpose of this life is to prepare for the eternal life to come, to see who succeeds and goes to heaven and who fails and ends up in hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear religious friends! Have you ever thought about what the purpose of that infinite life will be? In this short life, eating, drinking, wearing clothes, and helping others is considered materialism by you, and in response, you claim that the purpose of our life is the eternal life where the same eating, drinking, and eternal luxury won't be materialism? If you don't understand the purpose of that eternal life and have never been told about it, why deceive yourself by defining the purpose of this short life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the purpose of Allah's infinite life?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can think a bit further, consider this: the God of religions that question the purpose of our short life has been alive from eternity and will live forever. Has this God ever defined a purpose for His infinite life? Was the purpose of the life of a God with infinite powers and immense benevolence to create a world where the powerful have always oppressed the weak? Was the purpose of this God's life to continually kill His own creation through famine, earthquakes, storms, and floods? Is the purpose of this God's life just to see who passes the test of this insignificant world and who goes to heaven or hell? If only this God could have defined a purpose for His infinite life before determining the purpose of our short lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamist's Argument&lt;/strong&gt;: Our Parents also gave birth to us without asking us first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a significant difference between human parents and Allah. Human parents are subject to natural forces, societal pressures, and personal needs. To cope with the challenges of life, they may feel a wish, or even feel compelled to have children. Additionally, some parents fear the isolation that can come with aging, and they seek companionship through family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims believe that Allah, however, is &quot;al-Samad,&quot; which means He is self-sufficient and not in need of anything. If Allah starts &quot;desiring&quot; something, it would suggest dependency or incompleteness, contradicting the concept of being &quot;al-Samad.&quot; Thus, the motivation behind human parents' decision to have children is understandable. In contrast, Allah's reasons/motivation for creating the universe and humanity remain completely unanswered (both by Allah and by Muslims too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these differences, the comparison between the motivations of human parents and Allah does not hold. While human parents may create life to fulfill personal needs, but it is claimed by Muslims that Allah is free of any personal needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamist's Argumen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;: Allah does not need to tell us why He created us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, Islamic apologists come up with the following two excuses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allah does not need to tell us why He created us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And even if Allah told it, we could not comprehend it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, at least Islamic apologists admit openly that God neither told us about the underlying motivation for creation nor He told the reason for not telling it to us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if Allah expects us to use our intellect to recognize Him, then He must be prepared to address our genuine and honest questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's contradictory to &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; our intellect first to find Allah, only to later &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;abuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; our intellect by telling us that our intellect cannot grasp His motives for creating the universe. This approach undermines the very intellect that he encourages us to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, here's the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allah hasn't provided an explanation for the purpose behind creation or the test that comes with life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This can lead to various interpretations, including the notion that there exists no Allah in the heavens at all, and Muhammad was creating the revelations on his own. Given Muhammad's limited perspective as a human being, he had no ability to answer the question regarding the reason/motivation behind creation and test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Qur'an indeed tried to answer this question that humans and jinns were created to worship Allah, but this assertion met with severe criticism. Why would an all-sufficient God, who is supposed to be &quot;al-Samad,&quot; need worship and praise from His own creations? If He is self-sufficient, He shouldn't desire or need any form of adulation or recognition from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, if a God seeks intellectual engagement with humanity, it's only logical to expect clear and concise answers to fundamental questions. Without such clarity, every Tom, Dick and Harry can claim that their gods created humans for the sole purpose of worshipping and praising them, rendering the claims indistinguishable and unsubstantiated. There is no discernible difference between Muhammad's claims about Allah and the claims of others about their gods - all lack concrete evidence to support their assertions. This lack of proof renders all claims equally dubious and unverifiable.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The paradox of mankind's creation and a self-sufficient deity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran claimed that Allah created mankind for His worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/51.56&quot;&gt;51:56&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not created the jinns and mankind except to worship Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/11.2&quot;&gt;11:2&lt;/a&gt;: ‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Allah, the Eternally-Self-Sufficient/Independent-of-All (Himself in no need of anything)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when an entity starts to demand worship, it suggests a need, introducing &lt;strong&gt;an element of necessity&lt;/strong&gt;. This contradicts the essence of an all-powerful being, as such a being &lt;strong&gt;wouldn't require anything;&lt;/strong&gt; no worship, no acknowledgement of its existence, no prayers, no fasting month, and so forth. Consequently, this being &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; maintain the attribute of al-Samad (ٱلصَّمَدُ), indicating eternal self-sufficiency and independence from all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims often justify this by saying Allah does not need anything from us but &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; need Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/35.15&quot;&gt;35:15&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“O humanity! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah ˹alone˺ is the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, he is the one &lt;strong&gt;making demands&lt;/strong&gt; (under the threat of eternal torture) to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we need him? So he can spare our lives in the very machinery &lt;strong&gt;he&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;himself&lt;/strong&gt; put in place? We did not choose any of this. We have been made despite our consent, we are being put through a test we didn’t agree to, making choices he already knows and the endgame is written aeons before we were born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1362&quot;&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari 1362 Book 23, Hadith 115&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Prophet said): &quot;There is none among you, and not a created soul, but has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is also determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or wretched.&quot; A man said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah guides whom he wills but not only, some people are born to go in hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.178?context=2&quot;&gt;7:178-179&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whom Allah doth guide,- he is on the right path: whom He rejects from His guidance,- such are the persons who perish. &lt;strong&gt;Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell&lt;/strong&gt; “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/32.13&quot;&gt;32:13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had We willed, We could have easily imposed guidance on every soul. But My Word will come to pass: &lt;strong&gt;I will surely fill up Hell with jinn and humans all together&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah is making humans (and jinns) solely designed for hell, how does this correlate with an &lt;strong&gt;all-just&lt;/strong&gt; God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allah's desire for worship suggests narcissistic motives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sense of self-centeredness arises if we consider the notion that Allah might condemn people to eternal hellfire simply for &lt;strong&gt;not acknowledging Him&lt;/strong&gt; as the true creator, regardless of their sincere intentions. Many kind-hearted individuals born into non-Muslim families contribute positively to humanity, yet their virtuous deeds would be deemed meaningless, &lt;strong&gt;leading to eternal suffering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perception becomes stronger when one believes that individuals, even if they acknowledge Allah as the creator, would encounter &lt;strong&gt;severe and brutal&lt;/strong&gt; punishment in the afterlife for failing to worship Him &lt;strong&gt;properly&lt;/strong&gt; five times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not forget that Allah causes the death of &lt;strong&gt;newborns&lt;/strong&gt; and imposes severe disabilities on &lt;strong&gt;innocent children&lt;/strong&gt; as a means to instruct other humans to &lt;strong&gt;worship Him correctly&lt;/strong&gt; or test their faith. Is this anything other than a &lt;strong&gt;spiteful&lt;/strong&gt; attempt to compel helpless inferior beings to plead for mercy and feed on their desperation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this narcissism is reinforced if we accept the Islamic story where angels are compelled to worship Allah without any free will, further emphasizing a self-centered desire for adoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The TEST (i.e. first recognising Allah and then worshipping him) is comparable to gambling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims often refer to life as a gift and the test as a small price to pay to continue existing in a celestial utopia. But think this through for a second, if you had the &lt;strong&gt;choice&lt;/strong&gt; between &lt;strong&gt;taking the test&lt;/strong&gt; (considering the risk of eternal torture) or &lt;strong&gt;not existing at all&lt;/strong&gt; (avoiding the prospect of eternal torture), what would you choose? I’m not sure about you but I’d rather not exist and avoid &lt;strong&gt;irredeemable suffering.&lt;/strong&gt; No amount of joy derived from existence would make me &lt;strong&gt;even consider it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah is against gambling and interest because &lt;strong&gt;high risk isn't worth a high reward,&lt;/strong&gt; then why does Allah force us to take this test for a &lt;strong&gt;high reward and high risk&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that it's different because we have control over our choices but &lt;strong&gt;it simply cannot be true&lt;/strong&gt; even if we forget about determinism for a second. Factors depending on cheer luck are rigging the game such as geographic location, upbringing, culture, social environment, personal experiences, political and societal factors, access to knowledge, educational and intellectual influences (and according to Islam, you have to deal with the influence of a &lt;strong&gt;literal evil entity&lt;/strong&gt; whispering in your ears.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these factors will undeniably impact how we process and assess information. We are &lt;strong&gt;not responsible&lt;/strong&gt; for what compels us, for what makes sense to us and speaks to us. Even after reading the Quran and its explanatory scriptures a thousand times with the most open mind, one might still find it entirely devoid of logic, scientifically implausible, and, at best, horrendous, and at worst, an insult to human intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human mind vs infinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human experience is &lt;strong&gt;inherently finite&lt;/strong&gt;, and our understanding is limited by the &lt;strong&gt;temporal nature&lt;/strong&gt; of our existence. Eternal consequences exist &lt;strong&gt;outside&lt;/strong&gt; the scope of our everyday experiences, making it impossible to fully grasp their magnitude. The human mind often struggles with &lt;strong&gt;conceptualizing&lt;/strong&gt; infinity and eternity. Concepts like eternal punishment are &lt;strong&gt;abstract&lt;/strong&gt; and exceed our &lt;strong&gt;cognitive capacities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains partly why humans keep sinning and the threat of hell &lt;strong&gt;fails&lt;/strong&gt; to embody an efficient &lt;strong&gt;deterring strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. If we were equipped to grasp such great scales which is &lt;strong&gt;incomparable&lt;/strong&gt; to anything we know, no human with a minimum of &lt;strong&gt;self-preservation instincts&lt;/strong&gt;, would consciously commit sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposition typically uses the following as a counterargument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2749&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim 2749 Book 50, Hadith 13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them. &quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans sin despite the prospect of hell because Allah wouldn't want a world without sinners, he made us imperfect for that very reason. The key point here is &lt;strong&gt;repentance&lt;/strong&gt;, that's what God &lt;strong&gt;thrives&lt;/strong&gt; for. We are to understand that our &lt;strong&gt;propensity to sin&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;overrides&lt;/strong&gt; our &lt;strong&gt;self-preservation instincts&lt;/strong&gt;. Knowing that repentance doesn't necessarily guarantee forgiveness, how does one reconcile this with an &lt;strong&gt;all-just&lt;/strong&gt; God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we are forced to take a test without having all the necessary tools to go through it all the while being &lt;strong&gt;highly disadvantaged&lt;/strong&gt; by our very nature. The outcome of failing the test transcends our understanding and is factually disproportionate given the finite constitution of a sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mankind’s existence VS its creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would Allah want to be worshipped, especially by a creature He Himself created? Didn't He already achieve recognition from jinns and angels? Sure, angels, often compared to drones, don't have free will and must &lt;strong&gt;unquestionably obey&lt;/strong&gt; Allah but if the goal was to create beings with free will, why not give angels that autonomy? Why specifically design humans? And considering that Jinns, like the rebellious Iblis, have free will, why not grant angels a similar capacity for choice instead of &lt;strong&gt;creating mankind&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of &lt;strong&gt;&quot;test (i.e. recognising Allah and then worshipping him)&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; enters the narrative &lt;strong&gt;ONLY after the creation of humans&lt;/strong&gt;, leaving a void in the &lt;strong&gt;inherent reason for their creation&lt;/strong&gt;. Put more simply, there's no explanation as to why humans were made in the first place. Believers often resort to expressions like &quot;God's mysterious ways&quot; or &quot;humans can't comprehend a deity's plan&quot; to address the lack of answers in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theists criticize science for not tackling the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; of our existence. Science focuses on the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and has been successful in providing the &lt;strong&gt;beginning of a provable answer&lt;/strong&gt; while having the humility to admit what it doesn't know (yet). Religions, on the other hand, claim to possess all the answers, yet they fall short on the most crucial ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The paradox of creationism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are to believe that mankind was sent down to Earth following Iblis's deception. Indeed, Adam and Eve were led by Iblis to eat from the forbidden tree and disobey Allah's command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;strong&gt;cause and an effect&lt;/strong&gt; in this story: God creates humans &lt;strong&gt;→&lt;/strong&gt; angels bow&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;→ Iblis refuses to bow and betrays Allah &lt;strong&gt;→&lt;/strong&gt; leads Adam and Eve astray &lt;strong&gt;→&lt;/strong&gt; Allah sends them to Earth as a consequence of their disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this burden was placed upon every person who has existed, regardless of their complete lack of involvement in the disobedience of Adam and Eve. Is it fair to hold individuals responsible for the &lt;strong&gt;wrongdoings of their peers&lt;/strong&gt;? Human diversity is vast, and the human mind is incredibly complex and variable. Another person in the situation of Adam and Eve might have resisted the temptation and chosen not to consume the forbidden fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to the following; there &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be any situation of cause and effect within the prism of an omniscient and omnipotent God. &lt;strong&gt;It's not possible&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to betray a God&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;by definition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt; can happen &lt;strong&gt;without his knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would imply that God orchestrated a &lt;strong&gt;series of theatricals&lt;/strong&gt; displaying individuals as &lt;strong&gt;mere puppets&lt;/strong&gt; to whom a role has been assigned and predetermined their fate to a &lt;strong&gt;horrifying and excruciating&lt;/strong&gt; place that He personally created for eternal &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; torment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; he also created another place where these same puppets would be at last deprived of the last bits of their alleged free will because Allah will remove all the negative feelings and emotions which &lt;strong&gt;characterize a human being&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allah’s failure to spread his message&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Islamic scriptures, God sent numerous prophets across different historical periods and nations, &lt;strong&gt;spanning the globe.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite previous messengers, humanity tended to revert to polytheism or altered the scriptures. In response, God sent a final prophet, offering &lt;strong&gt;one last&lt;/strong&gt; opportunity for humanity to embrace His message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are to understand that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most religions that existed until today &lt;strong&gt;were once Islam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam got corrupted by mankind &lt;strong&gt;every single time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam either remained monotheistic but &lt;strong&gt;heavily altered&lt;/strong&gt; (Atenism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, etc) or ended up with &lt;strong&gt;some form&lt;/strong&gt; of polytheism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad was the very last attempt for God to &lt;strong&gt;spread his message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several problems with this narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alteration of scriptures suggests that there was an &lt;strong&gt;original version&lt;/strong&gt; at some point in history. If the message was sent to all of humanity repeatedly, civilizations with &lt;strong&gt;well-preserved&lt;/strong&gt; histories should possess &lt;strong&gt;remnants of the original text or cultural relics&lt;/strong&gt;. Why is there a lack of material or cultural evidence supporting this claim? For instance, Chinese lore, the &lt;strong&gt;oldest recorded civilization&lt;/strong&gt; (5000 years), &lt;strong&gt;differs significantly&lt;/strong&gt; from Middle Eastern lore. Another inconsistency arises when considering scriptural accounts of a great flood during Moses' time; ancient civilizations like China appear &lt;strong&gt;untouched&lt;/strong&gt; during that period and continued to progress &lt;strong&gt;without evident impact or records&lt;/strong&gt; of such global events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that China had once received the message and subsequently altered it, embracing polytheism, how is it possible that it bears &lt;strong&gt;no resemblance&lt;/strong&gt; to Islam, while Arab paganism exhibits &lt;strong&gt;many similarities&lt;/strong&gt;? It is evident that these regions &lt;strong&gt;evolved differently, cultivating distinct cultures and beliefs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Islam was sent before and eventually underwent tampering, it implies that it initially spread. Wasn't the test &lt;strong&gt;concluded&lt;/strong&gt; the moment &lt;strong&gt;Islam vanished&lt;/strong&gt; completely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose Allah, in His great mercy, decided to grant mankind a thousand additional chances; what is that even supposed to mean? We as humans are &lt;strong&gt;not judged unanimously&lt;/strong&gt; as one entity; only the disbelievers (or sinners) possibly go to hell. So, what's the purpose of &lt;strong&gt;repeatedly resetting the test&lt;/strong&gt;? Is the ultimate goal a planet of Muslims? We know this won't happen because the scriptures prophesize that Islam will &lt;strong&gt;once again disappear&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to Judgment Day. There's a clear contradiction here: Allah judges individuals but resets the test as if humans were a &lt;strong&gt;monolith&lt;/strong&gt; and failed the test all together at once. One might argue that Allah wanted more humans to undergo the test, but it's explicitly stated that the test is reset because &lt;strong&gt;mankind failed it&lt;/strong&gt;. In a test, some succeed, some fail, and making new generations &lt;strong&gt;retake the test&lt;/strong&gt; due to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of their ancestors' failures makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't the recurring failure of the message each time it was sent suggest a &lt;strong&gt;flawed system&lt;/strong&gt; that is continually replaced or altered due to &lt;strong&gt;its own deficiencies&lt;/strong&gt;? Doesn't this indicate that it is not humans who are consistently failing, but rather Allah who is &lt;strong&gt;incompetent&lt;/strong&gt; in spreading his message? If, over several decades and across different generations, most students consistently failed to pass a particular course, wouldn't it lead you to question the &lt;strong&gt;teacher's teaching capability, his educational approach or the overall school's program&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam conforms to familiar patterns of evolving religions, marked by &lt;strong&gt;early divisions&lt;/strong&gt; into &lt;strong&gt;various branches&lt;/strong&gt;. Following its leader's demise, Shia Muslims emerged rather instantly. Later on, numerous schools, and subcategories such as the Mutazilites, sects, coranists and whatnot proliferated. Another notable evolution is seen in language; literary Arabic differs from spoken Arabic, &lt;strong&gt;posing challenges in interpretation&lt;/strong&gt;. I will not mention the missing verses pointed out in the hadiths or the existence of different versions of the Quran which directly contradicts the premise of its perfect preservation (or will I?). Nevertheless, the observable aspects of Islamic doctrine do not align with its &lt;strong&gt;final and unalterable attributes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repeating a failed strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah's motive was to test creatures with free will into believing in him, wouldn’t the most efficient way to do so by &lt;strong&gt;showing Himself&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If his motive was to test creatures with free will into believing in him &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; any observable evidence, why would he transgress that rule and show Himself to &lt;strong&gt;one particular human being&lt;/strong&gt;? Wouldn’t it mean that the test is about our capacity to &lt;strong&gt;believe in another human being&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;in God himself&lt;/strong&gt;? After all, prophets are always self-proclaimed, there are never witnesses of their experiences, never any tangible evidence, are we to believe in one human’s word however convincing it might be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah failing to bring His message to humanity time and time again &lt;strong&gt;defeats&lt;/strong&gt; the very essence of an &lt;strong&gt;all-powerful being&lt;/strong&gt;. A God, by definition, &lt;strong&gt;cannot fail&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only did He fail &lt;strong&gt;countless times&lt;/strong&gt;, but He kept using &lt;strong&gt;the same counter-productive method&lt;/strong&gt;, which is to reveal Himself to one man and expect the rest of humanity to believe in this man &lt;strong&gt;permanently&lt;/strong&gt; even after his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is to be noted that in comparison, Iblis has &lt;strong&gt;a direct way&lt;/strong&gt; to communicate with humans GLOBALLY since he can whisper in their ear until the end of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem with an eternal God in relation to the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah is eternal, why did He create the universe only &lt;strong&gt;13.8 billion years ago&lt;/strong&gt;? Additionally, if Allah expressed the desire to be worshipped around the same time, could it be speculated that He was eternally existent but became bored only recently, creating a game with mankind and Satan as characters for His amusement? This notion doesn't make sense because, as the all-powerful designer, Allah knows &lt;strong&gt;all outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;, and boredom contradicts the idea of &lt;strong&gt;a perfect and omnipotent being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Allah specifically show concern for Earth, particularly for mankind, who, according to Islam, is believed to have arrived only 6000 years ago (or a bit more, if you're inclined to engage in some mathematical gymnastics) . With billions of stars in our galaxy alone and billions of galaxies in the universe, what is the purpose behind creating such &lt;strong&gt;an immense cosmos&lt;/strong&gt;? Despite the anticipation of the arrival of the Mahdi in Islamic traditions, the focus turns towards Doomsday rather than exploring space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reflections prompt questioning the purpose of such a vast universe and raise doubts about whether this God is a creation of human imagination—a man-made concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a God, what motivated the creation of humanity? Was it an outcome of divine boredom, which would &lt;strong&gt;contradict&lt;/strong&gt; the notion of self-sufficiency, or was it part of a predetermined plan which humans &lt;strong&gt;aren't equipped cognitively to comprehend&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our freedom to shape our destinies ultimately doesn't belong to us, can we really aspire to anything as humans? What is the true essence of paradise? Does it entail perpetual indulgence &lt;strong&gt;in sensual pleasures&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;removal of human emotions&lt;/strong&gt; considered &quot;negative&quot;? (This assumption is flawed by the way, as every facet of human emotion is valid and integral to our identity, shaped by evolution and adaptation to our environment.) What does the concept of hell entail? Is it a place where God, a being believed to be beyond all imperfections, stoops to employ &lt;strong&gt;primitive and barbaric&lt;/strong&gt; methods of punishment, methods that we, as a species, have collectively deemed immoral as we became more civilized?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of our existence is imbued with simplicity: life emerged from conditions that were &lt;strong&gt;sufficiently conducive&lt;/strong&gt;, with the intricate &lt;strong&gt;process of evolution and chance&lt;/strong&gt; playing significant roles. Human evolution, supported by evidence like fossils, genetics, and artefacts, tells a compelling story of the &lt;strong&gt;gradual transformation&lt;/strong&gt; from our prehistoric ancestors to the complex beings we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religions, it appears, were established not just to address existential questions but also to &lt;strong&gt;gain power, impose personal will and unify humans under one system&lt;/strong&gt;. This strategy has proven successful over time, especially considering the gaps in our understanding of the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as science has advanced, it has increasingly contradicted many religious statements. If there was a God who sent prophets, one might argue that this deity should have possessed knowledge of these scientific truths thousands of years ago, yet most of the knowledge from the scriptures correlates with what they knew during &lt;strong&gt;their own time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation lends weight to the idea that religions are rooted in the knowledge and understanding of people from specific historical periods.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The paradox of mankind's creation and a self-sufficient deity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran claimed that Allah created mankind for His worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/51.56&quot;&gt;51:56&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not created the jinns and mankind except to worship Me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/11.2&quot;&gt;11:2&lt;/a&gt;: ‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Allah, the Eternally-Self-Sufficient/Independent-of-All (Himself in no need of anything)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when an entity starts to demand worship, it suggests a need, introducing &lt;strong&gt;an element of necessity&lt;/strong&gt;. This contradicts the essence of an all-powerful being, as such a being &lt;strong&gt;wouldn't require anything;&lt;/strong&gt; no worship, no acknowledgement of its existence, no prayers, no fasting month, and so forth. Consequently, this being &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; maintain the attribute of al-Samad (ٱلصَّمَدُ), indicating eternal self-sufficiency and independence from all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims often justify this by saying Allah does not need anything from us but &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; need Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/35.15&quot;&gt;35:15&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“O humanity! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah ˹alone˺ is the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, he is the one &lt;strong&gt;making demands&lt;/strong&gt; (under the threat of eternal torture) to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we need him? So he can spare our lives in the very machinery &lt;strong&gt;he&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;himself&lt;/strong&gt; put in place? We did not choose any of this. We have been made despite our consent, we are being put through a test we didn’t agree to, making choices he already knows and the endgame is written aeons before we were born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1362&quot;&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari 1362 Book 23, Hadith 115&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Prophet said): &quot;There is none among you, and not a created soul, but has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is also determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or wretched.&quot; A man said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah guides whom he wills but not only, some people are born to go in hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.178?context=2&quot;&gt;7:178-179&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whom Allah doth guide,- he is on the right path: whom He rejects from His guidance,- such are the persons who perish. &lt;strong&gt;Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell&lt;/strong&gt; “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/32.13&quot;&gt;32:13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had We willed, We could have easily imposed guidance on every soul. But My Word will come to pass: &lt;strong&gt;I will surely fill up Hell with jinn and humans all together&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah is making humans (and jinns) solely designed for hell, how does this correlate with an &lt;strong&gt;all-just&lt;/strong&gt; God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allah's desire for worship suggests narcissistic motives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sense of self-centeredness arises if we consider the notion that Allah might condemn people to eternal hellfire simply for &lt;strong&gt;not acknowledging Him&lt;/strong&gt; as the true creator, regardless of their sincere intentions. Many kind-hearted individuals born into non-Muslim families contribute positively to humanity, yet their virtuous deeds would be deemed meaningless, &lt;strong&gt;leading to eternal suffering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perception becomes stronger when one believes that individuals, even if they acknowledge Allah as the creator, would encounter &lt;strong&gt;severe and brutal&lt;/strong&gt; punishment in the afterlife for failing to worship Him &lt;strong&gt;properly&lt;/strong&gt; five times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not forget that Allah causes the death of &lt;strong&gt;newborns&lt;/strong&gt; and imposes severe disabilities on &lt;strong&gt;innocent children&lt;/strong&gt; as a means to instruct other humans to &lt;strong&gt;worship Him correctly&lt;/strong&gt; or test their faith. Is this anything other than a &lt;strong&gt;spiteful&lt;/strong&gt; attempt to compel helpless inferior beings to plead for mercy and feed on their desperation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this narcissism is reinforced if we accept the Islamic story where angels are compelled to worship Allah without any free will, further emphasizing a self-centered desire for adoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The TEST (i.e. first recognising Allah and then worshipping him) is comparable to gambling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims often refer to life as a gift and the test as a small price to pay to continue existing in a celestial utopia. But think this through for a second, if you had the &lt;strong&gt;choice&lt;/strong&gt; between &lt;strong&gt;taking the test&lt;/strong&gt; (considering the risk of eternal torture) or &lt;strong&gt;not existing at all&lt;/strong&gt; (avoiding the prospect of eternal torture), what would you choose? I’m not sure about you but I’d rather not exist and avoid &lt;strong&gt;irredeemable suffering.&lt;/strong&gt; No amount of joy derived from existence would make me &lt;strong&gt;even consider it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah is against gambling and interest because &lt;strong&gt;high risk isn't worth a high reward,&lt;/strong&gt; then why does Allah force us to take this test for a &lt;strong&gt;high reward and high risk&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that it's different because we have control over our choices but &lt;strong&gt;it simply cannot be true&lt;/strong&gt; even if we forget about determinism for a second. Factors depending on cheer luck are rigging the game such as geographic location, upbringing, culture, social environment, personal experiences, political and societal factors, access to knowledge, educational and intellectual influences (and according to Islam, you have to deal with the influence of a &lt;strong&gt;literal evil entity&lt;/strong&gt; whispering in your ears.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these factors will undeniably impact how we process and assess information. We are &lt;strong&gt;not responsible&lt;/strong&gt; for what compels us, for what makes sense to us and speaks to us. Even after reading the Quran and its explanatory scriptures a thousand times with the most open mind, one might still find it entirely devoid of logic, scientifically implausible, and, at best, horrendous, and at worst, an insult to human intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human mind vs infinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human experience is &lt;strong&gt;inherently finite&lt;/strong&gt;, and our understanding is limited by the &lt;strong&gt;temporal nature&lt;/strong&gt; of our existence. Eternal consequences exist &lt;strong&gt;outside&lt;/strong&gt; the scope of our everyday experiences, making it impossible to fully grasp their magnitude. The human mind often struggles with &lt;strong&gt;conceptualizing&lt;/strong&gt; infinity and eternity. Concepts like eternal punishment are &lt;strong&gt;abstract&lt;/strong&gt; and exceed our &lt;strong&gt;cognitive capacities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains partly why humans keep sinning and the threat of hell &lt;strong&gt;fails&lt;/strong&gt; to embody an efficient &lt;strong&gt;deterring strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. If we were equipped to grasp such great scales which is &lt;strong&gt;incomparable&lt;/strong&gt; to anything we know, no human with a minimum of &lt;strong&gt;self-preservation instincts&lt;/strong&gt;, would consciously commit sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposition typically uses the following as a counterargument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2749&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim 2749 Book 50, Hadith 13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them. &quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans sin despite the prospect of hell because Allah wouldn't want a world without sinners, he made us imperfect for that very reason. The key point here is &lt;strong&gt;repentance&lt;/strong&gt;, that's what God &lt;strong&gt;thrives&lt;/strong&gt; for. We are to understand that our &lt;strong&gt;propensity to sin&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;overrides&lt;/strong&gt; our &lt;strong&gt;self-preservation instincts&lt;/strong&gt;. Knowing that repentance doesn't necessarily guarantee forgiveness, how does one reconcile this with an &lt;strong&gt;all-just&lt;/strong&gt; God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we are forced to take a test without having all the necessary tools to go through it all the while being &lt;strong&gt;highly disadvantaged&lt;/strong&gt; by our very nature. The outcome of failing the test transcends our understanding and is factually disproportionate given the finite constitution of a sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mankind’s existence VS its creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would Allah want to be worshipped, especially by a creature He Himself created? Didn't He already achieve recognition from jinns and angels? Sure, angels, often compared to drones, don't have free will and must &lt;strong&gt;unquestionably obey&lt;/strong&gt; Allah but if the goal was to create beings with free will, why not give angels that autonomy? Why specifically design humans? And considering that Jinns, like the rebellious Iblis, have free will, why not grant angels a similar capacity for choice instead of &lt;strong&gt;creating mankind&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of &lt;strong&gt;&quot;test (i.e. recognising Allah and then worshipping him)&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; enters the narrative &lt;strong&gt;ONLY after the creation of humans&lt;/strong&gt;, leaving a void in the &lt;strong&gt;inherent reason for their creation&lt;/strong&gt;. Put more simply, there's no explanation as to why humans were made in the first place. Believers often resort to expressions like &quot;God's mysterious ways&quot; or &quot;humans can't comprehend a deity's plan&quot; to address the lack of answers in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theists criticize science for not tackling the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; of our existence. Science focuses on the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and has been successful in providing the &lt;strong&gt;beginning of a provable answer&lt;/strong&gt; while having the humility to admit what it doesn't know (yet). Religions, on the other hand, claim to possess all the answers, yet they fall short on the most crucial ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The paradox of creationism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are to believe that mankind was sent down to Earth following Iblis's deception. Indeed, Adam and Eve were led by Iblis to eat from the forbidden tree and disobey Allah's command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;strong&gt;cause and an effect&lt;/strong&gt; in this story: God creates humans &lt;strong&gt;→&lt;/strong&gt; angels bow&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;→ Iblis refuses to bow and betrays Allah &lt;strong&gt;→&lt;/strong&gt; leads Adam and Eve astray &lt;strong&gt;→&lt;/strong&gt; Allah sends them to Earth as a consequence of their disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this burden was placed upon every person who has existed, regardless of their complete lack of involvement in the disobedience of Adam and Eve. Is it fair to hold individuals responsible for the &lt;strong&gt;wrongdoings of their peers&lt;/strong&gt;? Human diversity is vast, and the human mind is incredibly complex and variable. Another person in the situation of Adam and Eve might have resisted the temptation and chosen not to consume the forbidden fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to the following; there &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be any situation of cause and effect within the prism of an omniscient and omnipotent God. &lt;strong&gt;It's not possible&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to betray a God&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;by definition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt; can happen &lt;strong&gt;without his knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would imply that God orchestrated a &lt;strong&gt;series of theatricals&lt;/strong&gt; displaying individuals as &lt;strong&gt;mere puppets&lt;/strong&gt; to whom a role has been assigned and predetermined their fate to a &lt;strong&gt;horrifying and excruciating&lt;/strong&gt; place that He personally created for eternal &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; torment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; he also created another place where these same puppets would be at last deprived of the last bits of their alleged free will because Allah will remove all the negative feelings and emotions which &lt;strong&gt;characterize a human being&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allah’s failure to spread his message&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Islamic scriptures, God sent numerous prophets across different historical periods and nations, &lt;strong&gt;spanning the globe.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite previous messengers, humanity tended to revert to polytheism or altered the scriptures. In response, God sent a final prophet, offering &lt;strong&gt;one last&lt;/strong&gt; opportunity for humanity to embrace His message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are to understand that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most religions that existed until today &lt;strong&gt;were once Islam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam got corrupted by mankind &lt;strong&gt;every single time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam either remained monotheistic but &lt;strong&gt;heavily altered&lt;/strong&gt; (Atenism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, etc) or ended up with &lt;strong&gt;some form&lt;/strong&gt; of polytheism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad was the very last attempt for God to &lt;strong&gt;spread his message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several problems with this narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alteration of scriptures suggests that there was an &lt;strong&gt;original version&lt;/strong&gt; at some point in history. If the message was sent to all of humanity repeatedly, civilizations with &lt;strong&gt;well-preserved&lt;/strong&gt; histories should possess &lt;strong&gt;remnants of the original text or cultural relics&lt;/strong&gt;. Why is there a lack of material or cultural evidence supporting this claim? For instance, Chinese lore, the &lt;strong&gt;oldest recorded civilization&lt;/strong&gt; (5000 years), &lt;strong&gt;differs significantly&lt;/strong&gt; from Middle Eastern lore. Another inconsistency arises when considering scriptural accounts of a great flood during Moses' time; ancient civilizations like China appear &lt;strong&gt;untouched&lt;/strong&gt; during that period and continued to progress &lt;strong&gt;without evident impact or records&lt;/strong&gt; of such global events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that China had once received the message and subsequently altered it, embracing polytheism, how is it possible that it bears &lt;strong&gt;no resemblance&lt;/strong&gt; to Islam, while Arab paganism exhibits &lt;strong&gt;many similarities&lt;/strong&gt;? It is evident that these regions &lt;strong&gt;evolved differently, cultivating distinct cultures and beliefs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Islam was sent before and eventually underwent tampering, it implies that it initially spread. Wasn't the test &lt;strong&gt;concluded&lt;/strong&gt; the moment &lt;strong&gt;Islam vanished&lt;/strong&gt; completely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose Allah, in His great mercy, decided to grant mankind a thousand additional chances; what is that even supposed to mean? We as humans are &lt;strong&gt;not judged unanimously&lt;/strong&gt; as one entity; only the disbelievers (or sinners) possibly go to hell. So, what's the purpose of &lt;strong&gt;repeatedly resetting the test&lt;/strong&gt;? Is the ultimate goal a planet of Muslims? We know this won't happen because the scriptures prophesize that Islam will &lt;strong&gt;once again disappear&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to Judgment Day. There's a clear contradiction here: Allah judges individuals but resets the test as if humans were a &lt;strong&gt;monolith&lt;/strong&gt; and failed the test all together at once. One might argue that Allah wanted more humans to undergo the test, but it's explicitly stated that the test is reset because &lt;strong&gt;mankind failed it&lt;/strong&gt;. In a test, some succeed, some fail, and making new generations &lt;strong&gt;retake the test&lt;/strong&gt; due to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of their ancestors' failures makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't the recurring failure of the message each time it was sent suggest a &lt;strong&gt;flawed system&lt;/strong&gt; that is continually replaced or altered due to &lt;strong&gt;its own deficiencies&lt;/strong&gt;? Doesn't this indicate that it is not humans who are consistently failing, but rather Allah who is &lt;strong&gt;incompetent&lt;/strong&gt; in spreading his message? If, over several decades and across different generations, most students consistently failed to pass a particular course, wouldn't it lead you to question the &lt;strong&gt;teacher's teaching capability, his educational approach or the overall school's program&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam conforms to familiar patterns of evolving religions, marked by &lt;strong&gt;early divisions&lt;/strong&gt; into &lt;strong&gt;various branches&lt;/strong&gt;. Following its leader's demise, Shia Muslims emerged rather instantly. Later on, numerous schools, and subcategories such as the Mutazilites, sects, coranists and whatnot proliferated. Another notable evolution is seen in language; literary Arabic differs from spoken Arabic, &lt;strong&gt;posing challenges in interpretation&lt;/strong&gt;. I will not mention the missing verses pointed out in the hadiths or the existence of different versions of the Quran which directly contradicts the premise of its perfect preservation (or will I?). Nevertheless, the observable aspects of Islamic doctrine do not align with its &lt;strong&gt;final and unalterable attributes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repeating a failed strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah's motive was to test creatures with free will into believing in him, wouldn’t the most efficient way to do so by &lt;strong&gt;showing Himself&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If his motive was to test creatures with free will into believing in him &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; any observable evidence, why would he transgress that rule and show Himself to &lt;strong&gt;one particular human being&lt;/strong&gt;? Wouldn’t it mean that the test is about our capacity to &lt;strong&gt;believe in another human being&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;in God himself&lt;/strong&gt;? After all, prophets are always self-proclaimed, there are never witnesses of their experiences, never any tangible evidence, are we to believe in one human’s word however convincing it might be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah failing to bring His message to humanity time and time again &lt;strong&gt;defeats&lt;/strong&gt; the very essence of an &lt;strong&gt;all-powerful being&lt;/strong&gt;. A God, by definition, &lt;strong&gt;cannot fail&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only did He fail &lt;strong&gt;countless times&lt;/strong&gt;, but He kept using &lt;strong&gt;the same counter-productive method&lt;/strong&gt;, which is to reveal Himself to one man and expect the rest of humanity to believe in this man &lt;strong&gt;permanently&lt;/strong&gt; even after his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is to be noted that in comparison, Iblis has &lt;strong&gt;a direct way&lt;/strong&gt; to communicate with humans GLOBALLY since he can whisper in their ear until the end of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem with an eternal God in relation to the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah is eternal, why did He create the universe only &lt;strong&gt;13.8 billion years ago&lt;/strong&gt;? Additionally, if Allah expressed the desire to be worshipped around the same time, could it be speculated that He was eternally existent but became bored only recently, creating a game with mankind and Satan as characters for His amusement? This notion doesn't make sense because, as the all-powerful designer, Allah knows &lt;strong&gt;all outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;, and boredom contradicts the idea of &lt;strong&gt;a perfect and omnipotent being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Allah specifically show concern for Earth, particularly for mankind, who, according to Islam, is believed to have arrived only 6000 years ago (or a bit more, if you're inclined to engage in some mathematical gymnastics) . With billions of stars in our galaxy alone and billions of galaxies in the universe, what is the purpose behind creating such &lt;strong&gt;an immense cosmos&lt;/strong&gt;? Despite the anticipation of the arrival of the Mahdi in Islamic traditions, the focus turns towards Doomsday rather than exploring space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reflections prompt questioning the purpose of such a vast universe and raise doubts about whether this God is a creation of human imagination—a man-made concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a God, what motivated the creation of humanity? Was it an outcome of divine boredom, which would &lt;strong&gt;contradict&lt;/strong&gt; the notion of self-sufficiency, or was it part of a predetermined plan which humans &lt;strong&gt;aren't equipped cognitively to comprehend&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our freedom to shape our destinies ultimately doesn't belong to us, can we really aspire to anything as humans? What is the true essence of paradise? Does it entail perpetual indulgence &lt;strong&gt;in sensual pleasures&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;removal of human emotions&lt;/strong&gt; considered &quot;negative&quot;? (This assumption is flawed by the way, as every facet of human emotion is valid and integral to our identity, shaped by evolution and adaptation to our environment.) What does the concept of hell entail? Is it a place where God, a being believed to be beyond all imperfections, stoops to employ &lt;strong&gt;primitive and barbaric&lt;/strong&gt; methods of punishment, methods that we, as a species, have collectively deemed immoral as we became more civilized?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of our existence is imbued with simplicity: life emerged from conditions that were &lt;strong&gt;sufficiently conducive&lt;/strong&gt;, with the intricate &lt;strong&gt;process of evolution and chance&lt;/strong&gt; playing significant roles. Human evolution, supported by evidence like fossils, genetics, and artefacts, tells a compelling story of the &lt;strong&gt;gradual transformation&lt;/strong&gt; from our prehistoric ancestors to the complex beings we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religions, it appears, were established not just to address existential questions but also to &lt;strong&gt;gain power, impose personal will and unify humans under one system&lt;/strong&gt;. This strategy has proven successful over time, especially considering the gaps in our understanding of the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as science has advanced, it has increasingly contradicted many religious statements. If there was a God who sent prophets, one might argue that this deity should have possessed knowledge of these scientific truths thousands of years ago, yet most of the knowledge from the scriptures correlates with what they knew during &lt;strong&gt;their own time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation lends weight to the idea that religions are rooted in the knowledge and understanding of people from specific historical periods.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId303141"></a>There is No Greater Proof Than Love: Homosexuality is Natural</h2>
<p>Homosexuality is deeply rooted in a profound sense of love between individuals, with sexual intimacy being just one aspect of their connection. This is evident from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homosexual individuals experience love for one another, just as heterosexual individuals do.</li>
<li>They dream about their partners and long for emotional closeness.</li>
<li>Living together with their loved ones brings them emotional fulfillment.</li>
<li>They derive joy and pleasure from their intimate relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>Love, as a natural and fundamental human experience, cannot be considered unnatural. Therefore, the idea of homosexuality being unnatural can only stem from ignoring the presence of love within same-sex relationships.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId410268"></a>Objection: If "Love is Love," Then Water is Water—Why Not Drink Toilet Water?</h2>
<p>Some individuals with homophobic views raise this objection, comparing the concept of "love is love" to saying "water is water" and asking why we don't drink from the toilet.</p>
<p>This comparison is deeply flawed for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Emotional Connection:</strong><br>There is no love, attraction, or emotional connection associated with a specific toilet or its water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purpose and Context:</strong><br>Drinking toilet water is neither a source of pleasure nor a desirable activity for anyone. Bottled water, by contrast, serves a clear purpose and fulfills a need in a way that aligns with human preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dreams and Aspirations:</strong><br>People don’t dream of or feel emotionally fulfilled by drinking toilet water. Love, on the other hand, is a profound and deeply human experience, filled with dreams, desires, and emotional satisfaction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Homosexuality is not a trivial or superficial preference; it is a natural and integral part of human identity. It involves love, attraction, and emotional fulfillment—qualities that are incomparable to the absurd notion of drinking toilet water.</p>
<p>We hope that those holding such homophobic views can recognize the fallacy in this comparison and understand the importance of embracing love, compassion, and acceptance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId184286"></a>Objection 1: Paedophiles also feel attraction towards children</h2>
<p>It is imperative to address the objection that homosexuality is wrong by drawing parallels with paedophilia. To comprehend this issue, two key principles must be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nature is not <span style="color: #0000ff;">100% Perfect</span> for <span style="color: #ff0000;">humans</span></strong>. It is not flawlessly tailored for humans; it operates independently of human concerns. Humans make compromises and adapt to nature's course to ensure survival.</li>
<li><strong>Humans formed societies on the <span style="color: #0000ff;">PRINCIPLE</span> that <span style="color: #ff0000;">one person is not allowed to hurt another person</span>.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Imperfect Nature makes animals (including humans) fight others for food and sex and even kill each other. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Humans, unlike animals, have intellect and the capacity to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>control</strong></span> natural instincts, including love and hunger for food, to maintain a civilized society. While natural inclinations such as the tendency for <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love</strong></span> and to have <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sex</strong></span> and the need for <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>food</strong></span> are <strong>innate</strong>, society encourages individuals to exercise <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>control</strong></span> and refrain from imposing these desires forcefully on others without consent.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to homosexuality, where natural desires are acknowledged, but acting upon them is acceptable only when consensual and not imposed forcefully on another person.</p>
<p>Acknowledging Imperfections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imperfect nature may lead some individuals to exhibit short tempers, aggression, or even unnatural attractions, such as towards children.</li>
<li>Individuals with such inclinations are encouraged to exercise self-control, seek psychological assistance, and explore beneficial measures to address these circumstances.</li>
<li>Laws and punishments act as deterrents to prevent individuals from imposing their desires forcefully on others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distinguishing Pedophilia and Homosexuality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Categorizing pedophilia and homosexuality together is erroneous, as there is a fundamental distinction between predatory dynamics of '<strong>prey</strong>' and '<strong>consensual love</strong>' between two humans.</li>
<li>The origins of pedophilia and rape are rooted in <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>violence</strong></span>, where victims are treated as <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>prey</strong></span>. Homosexuality, on the other hand, involves consent based on <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love</strong></span>, where the other party is not considered as a <strong>prey</strong> but as a <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>partner</strong></span>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nature is imperfect, requiring <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>compromises</strong></span>. While some individuals may be naturally attracted to children, the absence of consent from the second party makes it unacceptable.</li>
<li>In the case of homosexuality, where both parties provide consent, no compromise is necessary, allowing individuals to lead fulfilling lives together.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId258057"></a>Objection 2: Homosexuality is <span style="color: #843fa1;">unnatural</span> while it is <span style="color: #843fa1;">disgusting</span></h2>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>One common mistake among religious individuals is the belief that their God/Allah is PERFECT, and He created a 100% perfect NATURE too. As a result, they find it inconceivable that more than two genders can exist in nature since God supposedly created only two genders.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Nature is indifferent to the concerns of humans and does not guarantee a state of absolute 100% perfection tailored specifically for them.</span></strong></li>
<li>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">In order to survive, we must adapt and make compromises in accordance with nature, <span style="color: #e67e23;"><em>even if we find them imperfect, distasteful, or encompassing certain risks</em></span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">The male and female genitalia harbor numerous bacteria and can carry diseases, unlike other parts of the body's skin. They may also lack a pleasant fragrance, often emanating an unpleasant odor due to their dual function for waste elimination. One might question why nature didn't design separate organs for sexual activity that was free from bacteria, and diseases, and possessed a pleasant scent like flowers. However, nature does not prioritize absolute perfection for human satisfaction.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">As humans, we must compromise and accept some level of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">disgust</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">risks</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> for the sake of experiencing </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">greater pleasure</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">.</span> The same is true about oral sex (i.e. kissing the vagina or penis) and kissing on the mouth despite the saliva being disgusting and also having bacteria.</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">Even Islam allows kissing the mouth, vagina and penis in a hetero relationship. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Here is a </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191229083005/http://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa2028">Shia Fatwa</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> about kissing and mouthing each other’s genitals being Halal. And here is a </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221130440/https://www.islamweb.org/en/fatwa/86412/husband-and-wife-can-enjoy-themselves-as-they-wish-within-the-limits-of-shariah">Sunni Fatwa</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> that it is Halal that a wife can take the dirty penis in her mouth, and the husband can splash his semen upon her hair and face and all over. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Instead of criminalizing sex, the emphasis should be on promoting safe sexual practices and raising awareness about preventive measures.</li>
<li dir="ltr">And homophobic Muslims cannot declare homosexuality to be a "crime" and "unnatural" on the basis of their argument of it being "disgusting" and "more" dangerous. <span style="color: #ff0000;">While the challenge for homophobic Muslims is to prove that their 100% perfect Allah has created a 100% perfect Nature which is absolutely free of any disgust and risk in a hetero sex-relationship.</span>  </li>
<li dir="ltr">If they are unable to establish the <span style="color: #2100ff;">absolute perfection of nature</span>, their argument against homosexuality also loses its validity.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId719457"></a> Do you also want to Ban and Criminalize 'Masturbation' while it is also not Natural?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We also want to ask from those who oppose homosexuality: Please tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Has your GOD told you that masturbation is Natural?</li>
<li dir="ltr">Or do you consider masturbation against nature too and want to ban and criminalize it? </li>
<li dir="ltr">And if you don't want to ban and criminalize masturbation despite it being against nature, why then these double standards where you only want to ban/criminalize homosexuality?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">As far as we (supporter of homosexuality) are concerned, then for us masturbation is also natural, as humans can enjoy sex through masturbation too. They can enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sex between man and woman</li>
<li>Sex between homosexuals</li>
<li>Masturbation with their own hands</li>
<li>When their partners masturbate them.  </li>
</ul>
<p>All these forms of enjoying sex are natural for humans and cannot be banned/criminalized. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId222145"></a>Objection 3: Homosexuality is not natural, but it develops due to the environment</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Islamic preachers claim that homosexuality cannot exist naturally, but it is only due to the brainwashing of the environment. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If homosexuality is a product of brainwashing only, then there would have been ZERO homosexuality in Muslim societies. In Islamic societies, they actually brainwash people against homosexuality, they also threaten people with draconian physical punishments, as well as eternal punishments in the hereafter. But despite all this, natural homosexuality wins over all the fears of Allah, eternal hell, physical punishments, and religious brainwashing. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly, no one brainwashes 3-year-old small children into homosexuality. But they automatically by nature start showing such homosexual behaviour at such ages. </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Objection 4: Homosexuality is a <span style="color: #e03e2d;">Unnatural</span> while it brings risks for STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases)</h2>
<p><strong>Our Response:</strong> </p>
<p>You cannot determine whether something is natural or unnatural based on the presence of diseases. For example:</p>
<p>If medical tests showed that two people were free of STDs, would you then consider homosexuality natural and allow them to marry? Additionally, STDs can also be transmitted through heterosexual activities. Would you then label heterosexual relationships as unnatural and prohibit marriage or force couples to divorce?</p>
<p>In simple words, cures are founds against diseases, but you cannot declare other things to be unnatural due to them. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Islamic TEMPORARY POLYGAMOUS relationships with Slave Girls also brought STDs:</strong></span></p>
<p>Islam not only allowed 4 wives, but also allowed to rape dozens of slave girls, and that too in TEMPORARY sexual relationship. </p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, Islam allowed the master to rape the slave girl (against her will). </li>
<li>Then, after fulfilling his lust, the master was allowed to hand her over to any of his brothers or slaves (against her will). </li>
<li>And after <strong>all of his brother and slaves had raped her and fulfilled their lust one by one</strong> in a <strong>TEMPORARY</strong> sexual relationship (like of Mut'ah in Shia Islam), she was sold to the 2nd master in the Islamic Bazaar of slavery, while the 1st master bought a new slave girl and started raping her. </li>
<li>And the 2nd master raped her again and then sold her to the 3rd master in the slave market. Thus, the cycle of rape of the poor slave girl continued (where multiple Muslim masters raped her).</li>
</ul>
<p>Sahih Muslim, Kitab-ul-Nikah (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140719221709/http://sunnah.com/muslim/16/147">link</a>), Sahih Bukhari, Kitab-ul-Qadr (<a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/82/9">link</a>), Sahih Bukhari, Kitab-ul-Tauheed (<a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/38">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>0 Abu Sa'id al-Khadri said: We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; <strong>and we desired (to have sex with) them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but we also desired good ransom money by selling them). So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing 'azl </strong>(i.e. withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception so that they don’t become pregnant and could be sold for good ransom money). But then we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: (Yes, it is allowed, but) it does not matter if you do it or not, while if any soul has to be born up to the Day of Resurrection, then it will be born.</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Islam also allowed the master, if he got lust for the wife of his male slave, then he could snatch away the wife from his male slave and rape her, thus destroying the whole slave family. </p>
<blockquote><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5105/" rel="mw:ExtLink" data-ve-attributes="{&quot;rel&quot;:&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot;}">Sahih Bukhari, [Chapter: "Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters..."]:</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. <strong>But there is no problem if a man (i.e. the owner) takes his (married) female slave (for himself) from his male slave.</strong></blockquote>
<p>The evil of "<strong>Temporary"</strong> sexual relationships with slave girls in Islam also led to another evil, where the swapping of slave girls also became Halal Allah. If a Muslim man got lust for a slave girl of another person, he can simply offer that other man to swap their slave girls for rape. </p>
<p>Tafsir-e-Mazhari is a commentary of the Quran, which is taught in every Hanafi school. It is written under the commentary of verse 33:52 (<a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/swap_slave_girls_mazhari.jpg">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Zayd said about this verse {وَلَآ أَن تَبَدَّلَ بِهِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجٍ nor to exchange your present wives for other women (<a href="https://quranx.com/33.52">Verse 33:52</a>)} that people used to swap their wives during the era of ignorance ... upon that Allah revealed this verse and the swapping of wives is thus not allowed. <strong>But the slave women are not included in it, and you can swapp them and there is no issue in it</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if Islamist Allah didn't prohibit raping slave girls in temporary sexual relationships due to chances of STDs, then Islamists cannot declare homosexuality to be a crime due to chances of spread of STDs too.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId197531"></a>Objection 5: Homosexuality is Unnatural while it raises the rate of HIV</h2>
<p>You cannot determine what is natural or unnatural based on the presence of diseases. Consider this question: "Would you view homosexuality as natural if science discovered a cure for HIV?"</p>
<p>It has been established that nature is not flawlessly designed for human beings, as discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Therefore, all forms of sexual relationships carry some level of risk, and individuals must make compromises between greater gain and lesser risk.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is essential for religious individuals to differentiate between "crime" and "disease." When an action is classified as a crime, it is prohibited. However, in the case of a disease, it is not declared a crime but rather treated and cured.</p>
<p>Sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, can be transmitted through both anal and vaginal intercourse, although the risk may be comparatively lower in vaginal intercourse. Should we then consider sex in the vagina as a "lesser criminal act"?</p>
<p>Hence, when there is a possibility of disease transmission during consensual sexual interactions, the focus should be on finding cures for the diseases and taking precautions to prevent their spread. It is not appropriate to criminalize these natural actions.</p>
<p>Scientific advancements have reached a point where AIDS is considered less dangerous than diseases like diabetes. Should we now consider the consumption of sugar a crime as well?</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>Note: Homosexuals don't transmit HIV to children, but heterosexuals do</strong></span></em></p>
<p>It is important to clarify that homosexuality itself does not transmit AIDS to children. However, in the context of heterosexual relationships, the transmission of AIDS from an infected parent to a child can occur and is indeed a significant concern.</p>
<p>AIDS, which is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can be transmitted through various means, including unprotected sexual intercourse, sharing contaminated needles, and mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. In heterosexual relationships where one partner is HIV-positive, there is a risk of transmitting the virus to their partner and potentially to any children conceived or born during the course of the relationship.</p>
<p>It is crucial to emphasize that AIDS and HIV do not discriminate based on sexual orientation. The risk of transmission exists for individuals of any sexual orientation who engage in behaviors that can lead to the spread of the virus. Proper education, awareness, and access to healthcare services are essential in preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS in all populations, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>
<p class="dcr-amp-1w3532u"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/09/hiv-infects-heterosexual-gay-bisexual-men-uk-testing-virus">HIV now infects more heterosexual people than gay or bisexual men –</a><a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/09/hiv-infects-heterosexual-gay-bisexual-men-uk-testing-virus"> </a></span></strong></p>
<p>We have already mentioned above, instead of criminalizing sex, the emphasis should be on promoting safe sexual practices and raising awareness about preventive measures and medical advancements. </p>
<p>It has already made a difference. Please read this article:</p>
<p>Article: <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/09/hiv-infects-heterosexual-gay-bisexual-men-uk-testing-virus">HIV now infects more heterosexual people than gay or bisexual men</a></p>
<p>Summary: </p>
<ul>
<li>In 2022, 49% of new diagnoses in England are among straight people (with an almost even split between men and women), compared with 45% for gay and bisexual men.  This is the first time in a decade that new diagnoses among heterosexuals are higher – marking a clear change in the shape of the domestic HIV epidemic.</li>
<li>Thankfully, this isn’t about a huge spike in HIV diagnoses among heterosexuals. Instead, it’s primarily the result of a sharp, sustained drop in diagnoses among gay and bisexual men with a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51122979">71% fall</a> since 2014. </li>
<li>Three big changes are making this difference. First, we are increasingly getting better at HIV testing. Second, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/07/california-law-hiv-prevention-pills-prescription-gavin-newsom">HIV prevention pill PrEP</a> (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is highly effective at protecting against HIV. Finally, we now treat people living with HIV as close to their diagnosis as possible. Early diagnosis and access to effective treatment means the virus is quickly suppressed to “undetectable” levels, meaning zero risk of passing the virus to sexual partners.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId429369"></a>Objection 6: 12-year-old children are permitted to take harmful hormone blockers</h2>
<p>Let us ask the critics: "Would you accept homosexuality if hormone blockers or surgeries were not involved?"</p>
<p>The real problem is that opponents often try to ban homosexuality entirely by focusing on secondary issues like hormone blockers and surgeries. While these are important concerns, they are not the main issue. You may disagree on these secondary matters, but it's not justified to ban homosexuality as a whole because of them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why Hormon Blockers are Needed?</strong></span></p>
<p>Individuals who hold homophobic views, they accuse liberals of administering toxic hormone blockers to their children under the guise of addressing homosexuality.</p>
<p>We repeat, the core issue at hand is the belief held by many religious individuals that nature is inherently flawless, as it was created by their perfect God/Allah. However, this is a misconception and a mistake. Nature does not strive for perfection specifically for human beings; it follows its own course without concern for us. As humans, we must adapt ourselves to nature.</p>
<p>Gender dysphoria typically emerges in childhood and often worsens with the onset of puberty, rarely resolving itself. This condition manifests in children through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Depression and anxiety.</li>
<li>Challenges in social interactions with peers.</li>
<li>Self-harm and suicidal thoughts or behaviors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Homophobes collectively deny the existence of these issues in affected children, relying on the notion that their God/Allah is flawless.</p>
<p>It is important to note that it is not solely liberals who propose the use of hormone blockers in these cases. Rather, <strong>this suggestion comes from numerous psychiatrists </strong>and decades-long scientific research<strong> involving hundreds of studies</strong>.</p>
<p>Puberty blockers offer transgender children additional time to explore their gender identity and make informed decisions regarding potential future medical interventions like hormone therapy or surgery. It is crucial to understand that puberty blockers are generally reversible and do not necessarily lead to irreversible changes. Contrary to the portrayal by homophobes, hormone blockers are not toxic. While they may have some negative side effects, as with any medication, all doctors, psychiatrists, and scientific studies unanimously agree that the benefits of hormone blockers outweigh any potential drawbacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hormone blockers have their advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine a biologically male individual who identifies as a girl. They do not wish to develop facial or body hair or experience a deepening of their voice, but they desire to present themselves outwardly as a girl. Hormone blockers provide the only solution in such cases. For those assigned male at birth, hormone blockers reduce the growth of facial and body hair and prevent voice deepening.</li>
<li>Similarly, envision a biologically female individual who identifies as a boy. They do not want to develop breasts. In such cases, hormone blockers limit or halt breast development and menstrual cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes typically begin around the age of 12, coinciding with the onset of puberty, thus necessitating intervention at this age. And we have to adapt according to imperfect nature and we are compelled to take steps at the age of 12. </p>
<p>For more information on puberty blockers, please refer to this <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075">resource</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hormone Therapy and Surgery</strong>:</p>
<p>Hormone blockers are distinct from hormone therapy. It is crucial not to confuse hormone blockers with hormone therapy. Individuals decide themselves about homone therapy (or surgery) after the age of 18 or later. They are adults at the age of 18, and can make informed decisions about themselves. </p>
<p>Yes, there are side effects of hormone therapy and surgery (like any other medication and operations), but studies show that positives for such individuals outweight their negatives. You cannot make people to suffer psychologically, make their lives so miserable that many of them develop tendency to suicide in the name of side-effects of hormone therapy or surgery. Scientific studies are again on the side of giving these people right to decide for themselves what brings them more enjoyment in their lives. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId947424"></a>Objection 7: "Do you believe a child who's 3 years old can decide their gender?"</h2>
<p>Muslim preachers object (<a href="https://youtu.be/7dBCTYNMgdM?t=15">link</a>) of whether it is appropriate to let a 3-year-old child determine their gender identity.</p>
<p>The response to this objection is not about asking 3-year-olds to make decisions about their gender, but rather about granting them the freedom to explore their own gender identity. There is no specific age limit; they can take as much time as they need.</p>
<p>We have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first option is to allow children to express how they feel internally, as nobody knows their feelings better than themselves. They can then seek the assistance of professionals who have extensive experience and knowledge of scientific studies in this field to explore their gender identity. Ultimately, the final decision rests with the children themselves, under the careful guidance and supervision of professionals.</li>
<li>The second option is to let parents make the decision, following solely what their religion dictates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing between these two options is straightforward. The decision of <strong>Children + Science</strong> should always take precedence over the decision of parents who rely solely on their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>It's important to note that children can continue exploring their gender identity without needing to make any significant decisions until the age of 12-13 years when their bodies undergo changes and the question of hormone blockers becomes relevant.</p>
<p>Islamic preachers hold an interesting perspective. They argue that a 6-year-old girl is wise enough to make a decision about her husband (even if she has never met him before), yet when it comes to deciding about their own bodies (something they inherently understand), these same Islamic preachers claim that children are not wise enough to make such decisions. Can you see the double standards here?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Islamic preachers often propagate falsehoods, such as the notion that parents want to mutilate their children (while being accepting of circumcision and even intersex genital mutilation!). In reality, it is rare to find transgender activists advocating for surgery or hormone therapy before the age of 18. Typically, their support centers around granting transgender children the freedom to dress according to their gender identity and the option to receive puberty blockers ONLY AFTER MEDICAL PRESCRIPTION, so they can avoid additional dysphoria, suffering, and undesired traits that they would need to address later.</p>
<p>Sadly, children's rights are often neglected, and even requesting parents not to physically discipline their kids is deemed excessive and labeled as "woke."</p>

<p>You would not believe it, but these are some of the favourite questions by homophobes during discussions. </p>
<p>So, why do homophobes ask these dumb questions? It has been made clear in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0uCLgFMC-c">video</a>. </p>
<p>In short, the answer is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A man is a male human being who identifies and presents himself as male, often based on biological sex characteristics, such as having male genitalia, hormones, and chromosomes.</li>
<li>A woman is a female human being who identifies and presents herself as female, often based on biological sex characteristics, such as having female genitalia, hormones, and chromosomes.</li>
<li>A trans man is a person who was assigned female at birth but identifies and presents himself as male. Trans men may take steps to alter their physical appearance, such as taking hormones or undergoing surgery, to better align with their gender identity.</li>

<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId243247"></a>Objection 9: Can a man get pregnant?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This is again a dumb question, but still one of the favourite questions of homophobes. Please see in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dBCTYNMgdM">video</a> how Islamic preachers Ali Dawah asks this question again and again from the supporters of homosexuality. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Have these Islamic preachers ever pondered upon it that many women can also not become pregnant, but still they want to be a mother of a child?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So what is wrong if a transgender woman cannot become pregnant? This does not kill her wish to become a mother.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId378147"></a>Objection 10: The shape of reproductive organs is a witness that homosexuality is unnatural</h2>
<p dir="ltr">And we answer religious people that the reproductive organs of animals also show they are not perfect for homosexuality, but still homosexuality is natural among them. <strong>And they are involved in homosexual activities without any brainwashing from the atheists</strong>. If any, then Allah has to be blamed for misguiding them towards the crime of homosexuality. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly, the shape of the reproductive organs of human beings is also not natural for masturbation. Still, Islam itself allows the partners to masturbate each other too. All Muslims agree upon it that partners could masturbate each other (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_masturbation#:%7E:text=Masturbation%20by%20a%20spouse%20or,%3B%20otherwise%2C%20it%20is%20prohibited.">link</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr">All religious people had to agree upon it, while Muhammad himself used to fondle his wives during their menses (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:302">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 302</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, when a Muslim husband is masturbated by his wife, or by his slave girl, then how religious people are going to fit such masturbation in the box of "shape of reproductive organs and nature"? </p>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly, Islam also allows a man to marry a minor child girl (even if she is breastfed) and to make her naked, and then to rub his penis in her thighs in order to ejaculate.</p>
<p>The largest Islamic website islamweb.net gave this fatwa (link<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160129102417/http://fatwa.islamweb.net/fatwa/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;lang=A&amp;Id=78529&amp;Option=FatwaId">1</a>, <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/minor_wife_pleasure_islamwebNet.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://shamela.ws/book/27107/72618">3</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220404131542/https://al-maktaba.org/book/27107/72643">4</a>):</p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">There is no objection to kissing with desire one's wife, who is a minor girl, and engaging in "thighing (Arabic: مفاخذہ)" which is to rub the penis between her thighs in order to ejaculate the sperms, and similar actions, even if she is unable to engage in sexual intercourse. Scholars have clarified that the default ruling is the permissibility of a man enjoying his wife in any manner he wishes, as long as there is no harm. They have mentioned activities such as self-stimulation by the husband using his hand, foreplay, kissing, and other similar actions.</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">Do religious people consider the thighs of a minor child girl to be a reproductive organ and its shape to be natural for sex? </p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, have you ever seen in the animal kingdom if any female partner is masturbating to her male partner or vice versa? But still Islam allows this masturbation for humans. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The problem is that religious people believe not only their Allah to be 100% perfect, but they also believe that the "system of Allah" is also an "intelligent and 100% perfect system", and free of any mistake. While the truth is this, there exists no such perfect system in nature. According to the theory of evolution, the survival of the fittest is possible, but it does not make them 100% mistake-free and they could have thousands of problems and irregularities present in their bodies. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Thus, the human body is also not perfect, and it could have many irregularities. Especially, human hormones and tendencies are delicate, and millions of humans are witness to their natural homosexual tendencies. </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId224535"></a>Objection 11: Homosexuality should be banned because it will cause the human species to extinct</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This objection is also not correct, while not all people are homosexual in society, but there are Heteros and bisexuals too. That is why in ancient Roman culture, where homosexuality was common and practised on a large scale, there still existed no danger of the human species going extinct due to homosexuality. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly, homosexuality was openly accepted and practised in China, during its entire history. But despite thousands of years of homosexuality, still they didn't go extinct:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_China</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, if the human species does not get extinct due to masturbation, then it is also not going to get extinct due to homosexuality, while more than 99% of males (including religious males too) practice masturbation. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, lesbian couples also wish to have children, and they have a lot of ways to fulfil their wishes. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly, even if gay couples cannot have children of their own, but still they also wish to have children, and they also adopt and raise children. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The "wish" to have children is not dependent upon being gay or lesbian, but it is dependent upon the "circumstances". For example, ancient Romans and Chinese were heavily involved in gay practices, but still they had a lot of children. It was due to the reason that in that old era producing more and more children was necessary for existence. </p>
<p dir="ltr">As compared to ancient Romans, today humans (especially in advanced countries) are not dependent upon children for their existence in old age, but the government takes care of them. Thus, this 'wish' to have more and more children also became less and less among the 'straight' people, and many of them don't want to have any children. </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId317024"></a>Objection 12: Scientists found no gene for homosexuality</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The answer is simple Scientists also didn't find any separate gene for being straight too. And those Muslim men, who ask their women to masturbate them, then there is no separate gene of masturbation found in them too. And for those animals, who indulge in homosexuality, then scientists found no separate gene for their homosexuality too. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The genes for the sex are the same, and it depends upon them how they express themselves further.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, there are no separate genes present for one's liking or disliking. But still some boys like fair complexion girls, and some like brown/black girls. Some like thin girls, while others like fat girls. Some like young girls, while some are attracted towards mature ladies. All this is not happening due to the presence of some separate genes, but due to the reason how these same genes express themselves. </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Objection 13: Homosexuals checking out straight people will lead to their discomfort </h2>
<p>We understand that this is a genuine challenge society will face. But please also keep in mind that we live in an imperfect world. In such a world, there are no flawless solutions. To coexist and thrive, we often have to navigate complexities and make <strong>compromises</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, this challenge isn’t exclusive to interactions involving LGBTQ individuals. A similar dynamic already exists in straight relationships. For instance, what happens when a straight man checks out a woman who doesn’t reciprocate his interest? Unfortunately, in our society, some men cross boundaries and make women uncomfortable, sometimes even disrupting their lives. Should this make women start hating all men? Unfortunately, not a 100% perfect solution is possible for this problem too.</p>
<p>The name of the solutions (although not 100% perfect) in both cases, is: <strong>COMPROMISE</strong></p>

			<title>The Suffering of Intersex Individuals Due to Illogical and Unjust Islamic Teachings</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<h1>Summary: </h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Be Aware of Deceptions by Islamic Apologists</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Muhammad commanded that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muslims must expel all intersex individuals from their homes and forbid them from entering again.  </li>
<li>However, Muhammad didn't stop there. He also decreed that intersex individuals should be separated from their parents and families and exiled from the city, even if they had committed no crime. He forced them to live in isolation in the desert, cut off from society and contact with others, effectively confining them to solitary lives.</li>
<li>And when poor intersex people started dying due to starvation, then Muhammad allowed them only to enter the city once or twice, beg for food, and then again return to their isolation in the desert. They were not allowed to take any job and to earn money and lead a happy life. </li>
</ul>
<p>These commands of Muhammad (Islamic Sharia) were completely illogical and unjust. They prove that there exist no Allah in the heavens and Muhammad was making the commands himself, and giving them the name of 'REVELATION', while only humans can commit such unjust mistakes. </p>
<p>However, Islamic apologists attempt to mislead by claiming that Muhammad didn't exile Intersex individuals, but he only exiled EFFEMINATE men (i.e., men who deliberately adopt feminine behaviors), thus confusing the issue.  </p>
<p>First and foremost, we encourage our readers to understand the differences between the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intersex/Hermaphrodite (Arabic: مخنث)</strong>: Intersex individuals are born with physical characteristics that do not fit typical male or female categories. Historically, they were referred to as "hermaphrodites," but this term is now outdated and considered offensive.</li>
<li><strong>Eunuch</strong>: A man who has been castrated, often for social or cultural reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Effeminate</strong>: An effeminate man displays behaviors, appearances, or mannerisms traditionally associated with women.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Islamic hadiths, Muhammad indeed ordered the expulsion and exile of innocent Intersex/Hermaphrodite (Arabic: مخنث) individuals. </p>
<p>Please note that effeminate men are often assumed to be homosexual, and Muhammad ordered the killing of homosexuals. It is highly unlikely that Muhammad would have allowed effeminate men to freely enter and interact with his wives in their homes, especially after the revelation of the verse of Hijab, which occurred years before the siege of Ta'if.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>(1) Muhammad Ordered Muslims to Expel All Intersex Individuals from Their Homes</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background Story</strong></span>:</p>
<p>Muslims were preparing to attack the city of Taif the following day, where they hoped to get hands to captive women (whom Muslim Jihadists used to rape after turning them into slaves)</p>
<p>An Intersex person, named Hit, visited Um Salama (the wife of Muhammad, who was present with him during that war) and instructed her brother to try to acquire a specific woman among the opponents as a slave after their victory. He described her beauty, noting that she had "four folds" in her stomach, which was considered a sign of beauty at the time.</p>
<p>Muhammad overheard this conversation and subsequently ordered Muslims to expel ALL intersex individuals from their homes, regardless of whether they had committed any wrongdoing.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4324">Sahih al-Bukhari, 4324 (Translated by Mohsin Khan)</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><span class="arabic_sanad arabic">حَدَّثَنَا الْحُمَيْدِيُّ، سَمِعَ سُفْيَانَ، حَدَّثَنَا هِشَامٌ، عَنْ أَبِيهِ، عَنْ زَيْنَبَ ابْنَةِ أَبِي سَلَمَةَ، عَنْ أُمِّهَا أُمِّ سَلَمَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ دَخَلَ عَلَىَّ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَعِنْدِي <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>مُخَنَّثٌ</strong></span> فَسَمِعْتُهُ يَقُولُ لِعَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ أَبِي أُمَيَّةَ يَا عَبْدَ اللَّهِ أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ الطَّائِفَ غَدًا فَعَلَيْكَ بِابْنَةِ غَيْلاَنَ، فَإِنَّهَا تُقْبِلُ بِأَرْبَعٍ وَتُدْبِرُ بِثَمَانٍ‏.‏ وَقَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏</span> <span class="arabic_text_details arabic">"‏ لاَ يَدْخُلَنَّ هَؤُلاَءِ عَلَيْكُنَّ ‏"</span><span class="arabic_sanad arabic">‏‏.‏ قَالَ ابْنُ عُيَيْنَةَ وَقَالَ ابْنُ جُرَيْجٍ الْمُخَنَّثُ هِيتٌ‏.‏ حَدَّثَنَا مَحْمُودٌ حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو أُسَامَةَ عَنْ هِشَامٍ بِهَذَا، وَزَادَ وَهْوَ مُحَاصِرٌ الطَّائِفَ يَوْمَئِذٍ‏.‏</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Um Salama: The Prophet (ﷺ) came to me while there was an <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>effeminate</strong></span> man (Arabic: <span><span class="arabic_sanad arabic"><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>مُخَنَّثٌ</strong></span></span></span>) sitting with me, and I heard him (i.e. the effeminate man) saying to `Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya, "O `Abdullah! See if Allah should make you conquer Ta'if tomorrow, then take the daughter of Ghailan (in marriage) <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><i><em class="italic">[<strong>Our Comment</strong>: It is not about marriage, but about raping her as slave, and the English translator showed another dishonesty by calling it a MARRIAGE]</em></i></span> as (she is so beautiful and fat that) she shows four folds of flesh when facing you, and eight when she turns her back." The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, "These (effeminate men) should never enter upon you (O women!)." Ibn Juraij said, "That effeminate man was called Hit." Narrated Hisham (the sub-narrator): The above narration and added extra, that at that time, the Prophet, was besieging Taif.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As previously mentioned, this translation is misleading and dishonest. The Arabic word مُخَنَّثٌ in this hadith does not refer to an effeminate man but rather to an intersex (hermaphrodite) individual. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is highly improbable that Muhammad would have permitted effeminate men to freely enter and interact with his wives in their homes, especially after the verse of Hijab was revealed. This verse (Quran <span><a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=33&amp;vid=59">33:59</a></span>) was revealed in the 5th year of Hijri, while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Ta%27if">Siege of Ta'if</a> mentioned in this narration occurred in the 8th year of Hijri.</li>
<li>Effeminate men are typically either attracted to other men (homosexuals) or attracted to women. They are not castrated and do not exhibit EUNUCH-like behavior.</li>
<li>In the case of homosexuals, Muhammad did not order exile but prescribed the death penalty.</li>
</ol>
<p>So why would Muhammad (and his Allah) not have known this and still allowed these effeminate MEN to enter his home and interact with his wives for years, despite potential attraction toward women?</p>
<p>The simple answer is that they were not effeminate men, but intersex individuals whom Muhammad had allowed to interact with his wives. </p>
<p><span>Luckily, we have still one English Translator, Aisha Bewley, who translated it correctly: </span></p>
<p><a href="https://aishabewley.org/bukhari29#maghazi">Sahih Bukhari, 4069 (Translated by Aisha Bewley)</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>4069. It is related from Umm Salama, "The Prophet , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, visited me when there was a <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>hermaphropdite</strong></span> with me and heard him say to 'Abdullah ibn Umayya, 'O 'Abdullah! If you think that Allah will let you conquer tomorrow, then you must have the daughter of Ghaylan. She has four folds facing you and eight with her back to you.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do not let those people visit you (women).'" Ibn Jurayj said, "The hermaphropdite was called Hit."

<h2>(2) Muhammad further ordered to separate them from their families, and then <span style="color: #e03e2d;">Exile</span> them <span style="color: #e03e2d;">ALL</span> from the city </h2>
<p>Muhammad didn't stop asking Muslims to expel poor intersex individuals from their homes. But he went further and he asked Muslims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate intersex individuals from their parents and families. </li>
<li>And then exile them from the city to the desserts. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, poor intersex people were forced to live in isolation, akin to solitary confinement, regardless of their innocence or whether they had committed any crime.</p>

<div class="hadith_narrated">
<h2>(3) Their Only Option to Survive Was to Beg for Food</h2>
<p>Muhammad prohibited intersex indviduals to take any job and to earn their living, but to live in exile in poverty. People told Muhammad, in that case, they would die due to starvation. Upon that, Muhammad allowed them to enter the city twice, and beg for food. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4110">Sunan Abi Dawud 4110</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.. (when Muhammad exiled that intersex person in the above mentioned narration, then he was told) Messenger of Allah, in that case he will die of starvation. So he allowed him to visit (the city) twice a week so that he might ask for food and go back.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Grade: <strong>SAHIH</strong> </span>(Albani)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that Muhammad’s treatment of intersex individuals was harsher than that of beggars. While a typical beggar was allowed to beg daily and remain within the city (with his family and friends), an exiled intersex person was permitted to beg only twice a week and had to leave the city after each visit.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Excuse by Muslim Preachers: It Was a Crime to Describe the Beauty of a Woman</h2>
<p>Muslim Preachers blame that the Intersex person (i.e. Hit) was committing a CRIME by describing the beauty of that woman to another man, for which he was punished.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Firstly</span>:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">How can describing the beauty of a woman be considered a crime when Islamic Sharia itself mandates that slave and prisoner women be paraded in public with exposed breasts and stomachs? These women were also sold in semi-naked states at slave markets, where Muslim customers were allowed to touch their private parts.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Article Reference</strong>: </span><a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/islamic-slavery/46-islam-no-hijab-for-slave-women-and-their-breasts-naked-in-public" style="font-size: 1rem;">Allah/Muhammad forced the poor slave women to move with naked breasts in public </a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">On one hand, Muslim preachers declare it a crime for the intersex person Hit to describe a woman’s beauty, resulting in his punishment of exile and begging. On the other hand, Islam sanctioned the public exposure of prisoner/slave women’s bodies. How can these preachers reconcile this double standard? Why can’t they acknowledge the suffering of poor intersex individuals and injustice against them? Yet, Muslim Preachers call Muhammad “</span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">a Mercy to all Worlds, Mankind, Jinns &amp; Animals</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">”.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secondly</span>:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Even if we accept that Hit committed a crime by describing the beauty of the woman, why were all other intersex individuals punished? They committed no wrongdoing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why was it not sufficient for Muslims to simply expel them from their homes and not allow to enter their homes (like other men)?</li>
<li>After being expelled, intersex individuals would no longer have the opportunity to describe the beauty of any woman. So why was exile from the city necessary, which caused them extreme pain of separation from their families and hardships of living in deserts?</li>
</ul>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>Additionally, if describing the beauty of women is forbidden only for effeminate individuals, does this not create a double standard? Are women or male slaves subjected to the same scrutiny? According to Islamic Sharia, male slaves are considered “Mahram” and do not require Hijab from their masters' wives and daughters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article Reference:</strong> <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/lgbtq/155-islam-vs-adopted-children-how-islam-impacts-their-lives-negatively" style="font-size: 1rem;">Double Standards of Islam: An adult male slave becomes Mahram as soon as he is bought, but an adopted son becomes a Non-Mahram for his foster mother, as soon as he becomes an adult.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So what if male slaves describe the beauty of any woman? Are you then going to expel and exile all slaves too? Or are you going to show Double Standards again, and keep the slaves in your homes, although male slaves have more LUST for women than effeminate ?</p>
<p>How Muslim Preachers cannot see such huge and clear CONTRADICTIONS in the system of Islam? </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thirdly</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of immediately imposing the harsh punishment of exile and solitary confinement, wouldn't it have been more appropriate for Muhammad to first teach him the etiquette and rules, making it clear that describing a woman's beauty is forbidden? </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fourthly</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Due to the peculiar teachings of Muhammad and Islamic Sharia, Muslims have developed a deep-seated animosity toward intersex individuals, similar to the widespread disdain for dogs today.</p>
<p>For the past 1,400 years, intersex individuals have endured significant suffering. Tragically, even their own Muslim families often turned against them. It is incredibly painful when one's own family harbors hatred for reasons beyond one's control.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fifthly</strong></span>:</p>
<p>We are grateful to the secular Western system for recognizing intersex individuals as human beings deserving of full respect and rights for the first time in history. The entire world owes a debt of gratitude to the Western system for its groundbreaking efforts in granting rights to slaves, women, intersex individuals, minorities, and even animals.</p>
<p>This secular Western system has demonstrated a form of morality that is often criticized and rejected by followers of Islam, who label it as “immoral.”</p>
<p>We take pride in our secular values and the moral principles they uphold.</p>
<p>While Muslims assert that Allah holds a monopoly on morality, the actions and teachings of Allah and Muhammad, as seen in these instances, reveal a different picture.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>(4) Killing an intersex individual only for resembling women</h2>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4928">Sunan Abi Dawud, 4928</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أُتِيَ <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>بِمُخَنَّثٍ</strong></span> قَدْ خَضَبَ يَدَيْهِ وَرِجْلَيْهِ بِالْحِنَّاءِ فَقَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ مَا بَالُ هَذَا ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فَقِيلَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ يَتَشَبَّهُ بِالنِّسَاءِ ‏.‏ فَأُمِرَ بِهِ فَنُفِيَ إِلَى النَّقِيعِ فَقَالُوا يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ أَلاَ نَقْتُلُهُ فَقَالَ ‏"‏ إِنِّي نُهِيتُ عَنْ قَتْلِ الْمُصَلِّينَ ‏"‏ ‏.‏</span></p>
<p>An <strong>effeminate</strong> man [Wrong Translation: The word is مخنث, which means intersex individual] who had dyed his hands and feet with henna was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ). He asked: What is the matter with this man? He was told: "Messenger of Allah! He imitates the look of women." So he issued an order regarding him and he was banished to an-Naqi'. The people said: Messenger of Allah! Should we not kill him? He said: <strong>I have been prohibited from killing people who pray</strong>. AbuUsamah said: Naqi' is a region near Medina and not a Baqi'.</p>
<p>Grade: <strong>SAHIH</strong> (Al-Albani)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to human nature, intersex individuals can naturally experience feelings of love. It is entirely normal for an intersex person to feel attraction toward men and to identify internally as a woman (or vice versa).</p>
<p>However, Muhammad and Allah considered this to be the greatest crime. </p>
<p>If an intersex man (or any gay individual) engages in a romantic relationship with another man, marries, and has a sexual relationship, it is deemed the gravest of sins by Muhammad and Allah. </p>
<p>In fact, even merely identifying as a woman internally (without any sexual interaction) and adopting feminine practices, such as using henna, is seen as a severe crime deserving of death according to Muhammad and Allah.</p>
<p>The only factor that spared such an intersex person from execution was their practice of Salah (5 times Islamic prayer). Without it, Muhammad would have ordered their death. In simple words, this means that if a non-Muslim intersex individual  had used henna, then Muhammad would have defenitely commanded to kill that individual. </p>

			<title>A Love Story of a Homosexual Person </title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/14-uncontrollable-love-a-story-of-a-homosexual-person</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/14-uncontrollable-love-a-story-of-a-homosexual-person</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today I regret</p>
<p>My friend was swearing by Allah, as he wanted me to believe that Love had him in its grip and that he was powerless to resist.</p>
<p>While I was abusing him and telling him not to swear by Allah for his HARAM Love. </p>
<p>But he kept on swearing, while I threatened him that either his love would end, or our friendship would end.</p>
<p>And his LOVER was himself unaware of my friend's love. He perhaps didn't even know about the existence of my friend. It was completely a one-sided love. </p>
<p>Still my friend was thinking only about him. </p>
<p>And then he made the further mistake of trusting a religious person like me to be his friend and told me about his love</p>
<p>Alas, why was I unable to feel his loneliness? And I made him even lonelier.</p>
<p>Now I feel as if I killed him alive. He didn't tell anyone else after me.</p>
<p>I saw him falling ill in love. I saw him being admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>Still, I felt no sympathy for him. I didn't even visit him.</p>
<p>Perhaps, pity did stir inside, but my religious devoutness took hold of me. And my humanity, it did hide. </p>
<p>When doctors didn't understand the illness, they recommended sending him to another place for a change.</p>
<p>His family first sent him to another city to the relatives. After some time, I heard he went to Canada.</p>
<p>But I am standing here today along with my regrets.</p>
<p>But perhaps not.</p>
<p>Today when I don't feel disgusted any more when I see these loving birds, and when best wishes automatically come out of my heart for them,</p>
<p>then I feel as if my regrets are perhaps being washed away, </p>
<p>But tears still come to my eyes</p>
<p>I perhaps unburdened my heart from regrets, but I didn't unburden the heart of my friend when he needed me the most.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
<p>When I left Islam and became an atheist, I still felt a strong dislike for homosexuality. This feeling came from the way religion had taught me, with stories that compared homosexuality to terrible things, like having sex with close family members.</p>
<p>Even after reading a lot and learning that homosexuality is not a choice, my feelings didn’t change right away. It took me years to fully get rid of this dislike, which I now understand was caused by religious teachings from my childhood.</p>
<p>Many ex-Muslims face similar struggles. For example, they may find it hard to eat pork or non-Halal chicken, even though they no longer believe in the rules that make these foods forbidden. This is similar to how some atheists in Western countries might feel uncomfortable eating snakes or insects because their culture taught them it’s disgusting.</p>
<p>The important lesson I learned is this: <strong>we should not let religious people brainwash children for the sake of humanity.</strong> It creates feelings and beliefs that can take years to undo, even when a person no longer believes in the religion.</p>

			<title> Homosexuality: Is it a test from Allah?</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/214-homosexuality-is-it-a-test-from-allah</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/214-homosexuality-is-it-a-test-from-allah</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<h3 dir="ltr">1st Narrative: Homosexuality is not natural; only Satan misguides people into it.</h3>
<p>The original narrative by the Quran and Islam was: "Allah did not create homosexuality in human nature, but it is only Satan who misguides people into it."</p>
<p>And the proof is present in this verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://quranx.com/7.80">Quran 7:80</a>:  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And We sent Lut – when he said to his people, “<strong>What! You commit the shameful acts which no one in the creation has ever done before you</strong>?” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All Muslim commentators of the Quran write that there existed no homosexuality before the nation of Lot. Then Satan misguided them into it.</p>
<p>This means, according to the Islamic perspective, homosexuality is not innate to human beings but rather a result of Satan's misguidance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But then a question arose: "Why doesn't Satan run away when Muslim homosexuals recite the Islamic prayers of لا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله (meaning: There is no power or strength save in Allah)?") According to Islamic belief, this prayer is enough to rid oneself of Satan and his misguidance, as no power is greater than the name of Allah.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, this Islamic narrative of Satan's misguidance has also led to accusations against homosexual people of being possessed by jinns, resulting in Islamic scholars performing strange rituals on them, such as Islamic exorcisms involving the recitation of prayers and the entire Quran. These practices of Ruqyahs and exorcisms only serve to deepen the depression experienced by homosexual individuals.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId787937"></a>2nd Narrative: Homosexuality is a DISEASE </h3>
<p>The prayer of لا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله (i.e. There is no power or strength save in Allah) didn't help, and homosexual individuals didn't come out of their homosexuality.</p>
<p>Upon that, Islamic preachers came up with a new narrative, where the earlier narrative of Shaitan and his misguidance disappeared.</p>
<p>This new narrative claims that homosexuality is not natural but a disease. And instead of Ruqya/Exorcism, this time poor homosexual people have to undergo medical treatment and conversion therapy, which again brings only extreme depression to them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This narrative of disease is recent though. It started only in the last century when initially doctors tried to cure homosexuality with medicines and consultations. Nevertheless, this cure also failed after some time and new scientific studies proved it wrong. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Dear Supporters of LGBT Rights!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please don't accept this 2nd narrative by Islamic apologists. This narrative is nothing else than a LAME Excuse and an innovation (Bid'ah) by them according to their own Islamic standards. The Quran and Hadith never claimed homosexuality to be a disease, but only Misguidance from Shaitan. And no Muslim homosexuals of the first 1400 years history of Islam were ever given any medicines to overcome their disease of homosexuality. They were only blamed for being misguided by Shaitan. </p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId177409"></a>3rd Narrative: Being gay is a "TEST" and it is not a sin itself but practising it is a sin and crime</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The first two narratives failed miserably. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, modern scientific studies proved that homosexuality is indeed not a choice, but people are born this way (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/jul/24/gay-genes-science-is-on-the-right-track-were-born-this-way-lets-deal-with-it">link 1</a>, <a href="https://www.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/homosexuality">link 2</a>). Nobody brainwashes and indoctrinates small kids towards homosexuality, but they themselves start showing behaviours which are typically present in the opposite sex.  (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/jul/24/gay-genes-science-is-on-the-right-track-were-born-this-way-lets-deal-with-it">link 1</a>, <a href="https://www.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/homosexuality">link 2</a>). In fact, many children exhibit gender expressions and behaviours that are typical of the opposite sex, further supporting the notion that sexual orientation is not a choice.</p>
<p>Even as adults, nobody indoctrinates them, yet they naturally feel attracted to same-sex individuals and fall in love with them.</p>
<p>No one can deny this attraction and natural love, where homosexuals dream about their same-sex partners, just as straight people dream about their opposite-sex partners.</p>
<p>We have Muslim individuals who are gay and believe in Allah from the depths of their hearts, yet they cannot deny their natural attraction and love towards people of the same sex.</p>
<p>It became impossible for modern Islamic apologists to deny millions of testimonies of these millions of Muslim gay people. This ultimately compelled modern Islamic apologists to come up with a new narrative, i.e.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">"Although one may feel helpless when they fall in love with someone of the same sex, nevertheless, Allah prohibited it, considering it a <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>Test or Trial</strong></span>. You are not committing a sin simply because you are gay and feel attracted to someone of your own sex and fall in love with them, but engaging in sexual acts with them would be considered a sin and you must be killed in most horrible ways.. "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please don't accept this 3rd narrative by them. The Quran or Hadith have nowhere told that homosexuality is a test/trial, or homosexuals are naturally born with it.</p>
<p>A similar pattern emerged in the past when scientific studies highlighted the risks associated with cousin marriages. At that time, Muslims accused the scientific community of corruption. However, as time passed, many Muslims eventually accepted the findings of scientific studies, recognizing them as reflective of the Ultimate Truth.</p>
<p>Likewise, with regard to homosexuality, a change in attitudes is inevitable. Science has already influenced the perceptions of many Muslims. Nevertheless, they cannot jump to this narrative that they accept being gay to be natural, before declaring Islam to be wrong, which advocates the 1st narrative of "misguidance from devil" only. Yes, even the 2nd narrative of DISEASE is also non-Islamic and has no proof in the Quran and Hadith.  </p>
<p dir="ltr">Please do challenge these 2nd and 3rd narratives, and demand Muslim apologists to first declare Islam to be wrong before going to these 2nd and 3rd narratives. </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Objections by Muslim Apologists:</h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">1st Objection: Allah didn't ask to use لاحول prayer </h3>
<p dir="ltr">An Islamic preacher wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Islam does not prescribe the prayer of لا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله (i.e. There is no power or strength save in Allah) against homosexuality. Nor does Islam prescribe exorcism for it. In fact, it prescribes nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Response: </strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If Islam is unable to prescribe anything against it, then it is due to the reason that there exists no All-Knowing Allah in the heavens, and Muhammad got confused as he had no solution to this.</p>
<p>Allah said in the Quran that the nation of Lut was the first to be misguided by Satan. Therefore, Muslims have logically concluded that misguidance comes only from Satan, and one can rid oneself of Satan's misguidance by reciting لاحول or performing Ruqyas (Islamic exorcisms).</p>
<p>So, how can you disagree with Muslims for arriving at this logical conclusion?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">2nd Objection: Homosexuality can be caused by external factors like childhood trauma</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Another Islamic preacher wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Childhood trauma from abuse can influence how you view things later in life and may push you towards homosexuality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even if we assume that homosexuality is only caused by childhood trauma, the point is, the Quran doesn't mention this (i.e., childhood trauma) to be the reason for being homosexual. But it is clear that homosexuality comes from the misguidance of Satan.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There are many who never had any childhood trauma, yet they are still attracted to homosexuality. On our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/">ex-Muslim subreddit</a>, there are thousands of testimonies from Muslim boys and girls who come from religious families, yet they are still homosexuals. They have religiously brainwashed their entire life that homosexuality is a sin and crime, but still, religion got defeated against their nature. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, we all know that a young boy, who behaves like a girl, his life automatically becomes difficult. He has to stay among men in most societies. And when men see him behaving like a girl, then they look at him as prey, Thus, if the rate is higher among homosexuals that they were raped as children, then it is not proof that they become homosexuals later due to that childhood trauma, but the opposite could be true (i.e. they are in danger of being raped while they automatically behave like girls right from their childhood).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Homosexuals win this case even without science, solely on the basis of their Testimonies</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Islamic preachers come up with only one excuse that science has not found any gay gene. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And our response is that even if science has not 100% found out the reasons for people becoming homosexuals, still we have millions of testimonies where homosexual people are witnessing that they were born so, and they never felt an attraction towards the opposite sex. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, even without science, homosexual people win this case solely on the basis of their testimonies. </p>

<p>Please also watch this video in order to understand that homosexuality is not a choice. </p>

			<title>Zakir Naik: Homosexuality begins when you violate the rule of Hijab</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/226-zakir-naik-homosexuality</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/226-zakir-naik-homosexuality</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Zakir Naik claims two reasons for becoming homosexual:</p>
<ol>
<li>Homosexuality starts when you break the rule of Hijab. If you maintain Hijab, it will never happen</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">If you sleep with 20, 30, 40 or more women, you get tired and become homosexual.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please watch this video of Zakir Naik:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrh5fyjKtFY?start=26" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Response:</span></strong></p>
<p>Zakir Naik is absolutely wrong on all accounts.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Firstly:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>It were Sahaba and Jihadists (including Muhammad) who slept with 10, 20, 30 or more women (wives, captive and slave women). </li>
<li>And Muhammad himself broke the rule of Hijab when he prohibited slave women to take Hijab. And Umar ibn Khattab used to beat slave women for taking HIjab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by taking Hijab. And Muhammad even kept the chests of slave women naked. Yes, there were thousands of slave women present in public with naked breasts in Islamic countries. For details, please read this article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-hijab/11-islam-prohibited-hijab-for-slave-women-and-kept-their-breasts-naked"> Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, as Islam prohibited Slave Women from taking Hijab or even covering their naked breasts in public </a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Secondly:</strong></span></p>
<p>You will most probably become an old man till you are finished having sex with 40 or 50 women. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Scientific studies showed that gender dysphoria has nothing to do with having sex with 20, 30, 40 or 50 women, but a majority of homosexuals had it since their childhood. </p>
<p>For example, this scientific study <a class="content-link css-g0xkld" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2762788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="css-1qoyvah icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a> showed that, on average, study participants reported their <strong>earliest memory of gender dysphoria</strong> between the ages of <strong>4 and 6 years old</strong>. <strong>By the age of 7</strong>, most study participants could remember experiencing some feelings of gender dysphoria.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Homosexuality does not start due to breaking the rule of Hijab, otherwise there were thousands of slave women present in Islamic societies with naked breasts (including in front of Muhammad). Moreover, we see homosexual activities in great numbers in Islamic Madrassas too, where either women are totally absent, or even if present, then they are in Hijab. </li>
<li>And scientific studies are witness that homosexuality has nothing to do with sleeping with 20, 30, 40 or 50 women. </li>
<li>Zakir Naik is a dishonest person, who spreads hatred against homosexuals through telling lies. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<p>Please also don't forget:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Muslim man used to rape a slave woman. And after fulfilling his lust (in a Shia Mut'ah-type TEMPORARY sexual relationship), he sold her to another master, and for himself, he used to buy a new slave girl from the Islamiy Bazaar of slavery. In this way, a single slave woman was raped by multiple Muslim men one by one (or in other words, a Muslim man used to rape multiple slave women one by one due to the evil of temporary sexual relationships in Islamic Sharia). </li>
<li>If a Muslim master got lust for the slave wife of his male slave, then he was allowed to separate her from his male slave and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, she could be returned to her slave husband. </li>
<li>And Muslim men used to SWAP their slave girls with each other. This swapping allowed them to rape the slave girls of each other legally.</li>
<li>And Muslim men had dozens to hundreds of slave women present in their Harems. </li>
</ul>
<p>For proof, please read this article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/islamic-slavery/47-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity">Part 1: Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity</a></p>
<p>Moreover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad had 11 to 13 wives. </li>
<li>He also had multiple slave women.</li>
<li>Muhammad always got huge spoils of war due to Khums. Alone in one battle of Khaibar, he got 7 slave women, whom he traded for a single beautiful Safiyyah (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/16/102">Sahih Muslim 1365e</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

			<title>The Sufferings of a Homosexual Person in Islamic Society</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/239-the-sufferings-of-a-homosexual-person-in-islamic-society</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/239-the-sufferings-of-a-homosexual-person-in-islamic-society</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Please consider the immense suffering that individuals who identify as homosexual endure in a religious society. Here is a perspective shared by a member of the LGBT community:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is disheartening to think that within a religious context, homosexuality is seen as a sin and subject to punishment, implying that homosexuals were not created by a higher power for the same purposes as heterosexuals. Instead, it suggests that homosexuality serves as a reminder to heterosexuals that engaging in similar behaviors will lead to condemnation. As gay individuals, we are trapped unless we deny our true selves and pretend to be heterosexual, as that is the only acceptable path according to religious doctrine.</li>
<li>Homosexual children seem to be seen as a "test" for the faith of their heterosexual families and parents, if we accept the teachings of our religious beliefs. We are told that we have been given a "unique test" that only we can handle, as a person's soul is never burdened beyond its capacity. However, this feels profoundly unfair, as it has driven some of us to the brink of suicide.</li>
<li>It is unjust to label our existence and our inherent desire for love and companionship as a test of character. We are denied the experiences of love, companionship, security, intimacy, and joy that heterosexual Muslims are permitted to have, sometimes multiple times over. Meanwhile, figures like Muhammad had multiple wives (including slave women), and their actions were celebrated. On the other hand, people like me must constantly be cautious, enduring shame and disgust from others when we hold our partner's hand, while also remaining celibate.</li>
<li>This experience is more than just alienating; it encompasses every negative feeling imaginable. We feel like imposters in our own bodies, as if our very existence is a mistake. Doubt infiltrates our ability to think, trust, and believe in ourselves. We become terrified of everything: our safety, our sanity, and whether any little thing or thought might provoke God's disdain or incite disapproval from Muslims around us. We constantly police ourselves, lose interest in everything, succumb to depression, and contemplate suicide. Our physical and mental well-being suffer neglect. We become people pleasers, unsure if the personality we present is truly our authentic self.</li>
<li>Homosexuality is used as a means to accuse us of being secret pedophiles and rapists. We are dehumanized, with some suggesting that we have been possessed by supernatural beings throughout our lives without our knowledge. Muslims will never comprehend the overwhelming isolation and loneliness we feel, even when surrounded by our Muslim families under the same roof.</li>
<li>Heterosexual individuals will never experience the torment of exorcisms and conversion therapies—psychological, physical, and mental tortures—in an attempt to be "cured." Simply having a partner, even without engaging in sexual activity, subjects both individuals to judgment, mockery, laughter, and a lifelong sense of shame.</li>
<li>Some even go to the extent of forbidding us from being around our own nieces and nephews due to an irrational fear that we will "influence" them or that they will become gay themselves due to our presence.</li>
<li>While heterosexual individuals do not face denial of healthcare, job opportunities, access to banking, social services, or assistance, openly gay Muslims encounter such discrimination in Islamic countries. Openly gay individuals worldwide live in constant fear of encountering religious extremists who own businesses, hotels, taxi services, clinics, or hold positions within emergency services. The risk of being harmed by a homophobic police officer or neglected by an anti-gay nurse or doctor is a genuine concern. Furthermore, the fear of being labeled a criminal and a threat to society by politicians or religious figures adds to the humiliation. The process of religious leaders delving into our medical history or doctors breaching confidentiality and exposing our identity to everyone simply because we sought health screenings is deeply troubling.</li>

<p>I can go on... But you see my point. Allah (if he is real) is simply cruel.</p>

<h2>A message by a member of the US LGBT community to ex-Muslims who are suffering in Islamic countries:</h2>
<p>After the publishing of our article, we got this message, which is truly encouraging and serves as a source of enlightenment and inspiration.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I’ve been working for LGBT rights in the US since the 90s. For all of the differences , the environment in the US was very similar to what you’re describing. Homosexuality was illegal - gay bars were busted by the police resulting in mass arrests that would ruin people’s careers and lives. Dressing in “clothing of the opposite gender” was illegal and would result in arrest. Gay sex was not made a right that people have until 2003, when a Texas sodomy law, which they were trying to enforce, was found to be unconstitutional. Marriage equality was not established until 2015. And currently, those rights and others are under attack in the US, again by religious extremists trying to use force to make society conform to their hateful and medieval vision in order to restore themselves to power.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Before that, in christian countries, homosexuality could and did carry the death penalty. Just like in Muslim countries, sometimes it was “tolerated,” but it was never acceptable, and even the randomness of enforcement left everyone living under a cloud of fear.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You have all of my love and support, and that of the global LGBT community. Islam is wrong - both about this and in general - and it is my hope that the tides of history will reform Islam as a religion to create more reformationist schools of thought. It took christianity a couple of millennia and a whole reformation and enlightenment to get to where it is, and the political winds driven by western interference have not been pushing Islam in a great direction because it has tended to encourage radicalism.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I think that LGBT Muslims should leave Islam, but then I think everyone should. Same with Christianity. I think we, as the queer community, have an additional perspective and thus an additional push, and we have a community of mutual support and understanding, but it’s still a journey. If people cannot, it’s still understandable. It’s all a process of education and reflection.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I’m going to recommend a recent movie about a gay relationship and the tensions it causes in a Muslim man. It’s called <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-01-22/breaking-fast-review-gay-romcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Breaking Fast</a>, and if you have not seen it, you might find it a source of understanding. I’ve known gay Muslims, gay Hindus, and gay Christians. Every culture’s struggle is unique, and every person’s struggle is unique, but we all have far more in common amongst our struggles and experiences than we have divisions.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I hope that Islam can enter into a new period where an alternative to fundamentalism becomes dominant. I hope that you, and your LGBT sisters, brothers, and others can emigrate to a country and culture where you are free, even though I realize those freedoms are traded for other things that are also dear.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Most of all, I hope you are, and remain, safe.</p>

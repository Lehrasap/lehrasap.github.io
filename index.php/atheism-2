		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Muslim preachers spread propaganda that atheists have no hope of support from Allah during difficult times, leading to suicide. However, this claim is entirely false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that only religious people fear death. For instance, Muslims fear the process of death, where the soul is taken out by the angel of death. This process is painful, as shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1339&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 1339&lt;/a&gt;, where Moses slapped the angel of death. Prophet Muhammad also feared death and said, &quot;O Allah! Help me with the throes of death and the agony of death&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:978&quot;&gt;Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 978&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, Muslims fear the terrible punishment in the grave, followed by the possibility of being sent to hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, atheists have no fear of punishment in the afterlife. Yes, Atheists know that the process of death causes physical pain, but they suffer from no extra psychological pain that any angel will take out their souls while causing some spiritual pain. Actually, modern medical processes (like Euthanasia) have taken out even the fear of any physical pain at the time of death too from atheists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, atheists enjoy life until they can no longer do so. When suffering from old age or illness sets in, they are &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mentally prepared&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; to embrace death peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'mental preparedness'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is very important. I&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;t is your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;‘mind’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;, which supports you and prepares you to face all kinds of terrible situations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when nearing death, your mind will ready you by rationalizing that death is inevitable since everything operates under the same principle. It will also persuade you that death serves as a 'blessing,' liberating you from anguish and misery. As a result of this mental preparation, atheists typically remain tranquil during their final moments. Witness it in individuals opting for euthanasia; such instances depict calmness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, religious individuals endure both bodily and mental hardships at life's conclusion. They are unsettled, weeping, pleading, and seeking divine assistance amidst their woe. But should heavenly aid fail to arrive, Muslims encounter intellectual strain alongside their distress. They speculate about potential wrongdoings in their lives, questioning whether those transgressions might be the reason behind Allah's seemingly ignored petitions and, subsequently, the source of their excruciating demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Muslims, atheists become intellectually equipped for death, hence pursuing methods to minimize physical suffering. This path often leads them to consider euthanasia—the deliberate termination of life to alleviate torment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Islamic preachers label euthanasia as suicide and deem it forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for atheists, euthanasia is not considered haram, but rather a fundamental human right. They view it as a flaw in religion that takes away this right from humans by offering false hope that God or gods will intervene and rescue them from illness and pain. This religious deception forces humans to suffer a prolonged and agonizing life until their eventual death becomes a blessing and relief from their suffering. This, according to atheists, is one of the greatest cruelties inflicted upon humanity by religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we have numerous examples of euthanasia before us. In every single case, we observe that the individual is peacefully and happily embracing death. Therefore, even the death of atheists is not miserable; their passing brings them happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=euthanasia+interview&quot;&gt;Interviews of People before committing suicide through Euthanasia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please just watch these interviews. Just see how peaceful they are looking and showing absolutely no signs of fear or worries. They are mentally prepared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Muslim preachers are challenged to present instances of people choosing euthanasia but not experiencing peace and contentment. They will struggle to find any, whereas atheists generally embrace death with positivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the suicide rate is higher within the atheist community because its members are mentally prepared to accept their mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if someone does any injustice to you, it is still your mind that guides you to recognize that this universe did not come into being based on the principles of 'justice'. There is no inherent principle of justice within nature itself; instead, it is human beings who have developed a sense of justice over time through evolution, and therefore they strive to uphold it for the betterment of society. Your mind will instruct you that if anyone is doing injustice to you, you must exhibit patience and persist in speaking out against such injustice. As a result, our minds prepare us mentally to confront injustices with fortitude and valor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, there is no situation in the world for which our minds cannot prepare us mentally to face. Once we are mentally prepared, we do not require any additional false hope or divine assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, religious individuals rely heavily on the false hope of gods, failing to develop mental resilience in the face of adversity. Consequently, when their false expectations are shattered, they experience even greater anguish than before. False hopes prevent people from facing reality and making informed decisions, leading to incorrect choices fueled by blind faith. Ultimately, they become even more disheartened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike secular individuals, religious people do not allocate their energy, time, and resources towards resolving underlying problems. Instead, they invest their efforts in prayer and sacrifice to appease their deities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another ex-Muslim wrote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is tough when your whole world is Muslim, but you the outcast. If you are a loner, like me, uh it's fine, hell with them, but for a social person .. he just lost the entire social life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another ex-Muslim wrote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For me, it's the fact that it makes “people like me” who are gay and atheist seem like demons, and when everyone around you believes you should be put to death because of who you are and what you believe in, it's quite hard to stay sane and not want to kill yourself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Misuse of ‘Secularism’ by Islamists in the West to refuse Integration</title>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Islamic Preachers come up with the following argument, in order to defend the Quranic teachings of non-integration:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;com-content-article__body&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secularism is against &lt;strong&gt;collectivism&lt;/strong&gt; and based upon ‘&lt;strong&gt;individualism&lt;/strong&gt;’ and talks about the rights and liberties of an individual person. It’s moral stance is that an individual person is allowed to do whatever he wishes to do, and let others do whatever they want to do. Therefore, when the Western people demands the ‘&lt;strong&gt;social integration&lt;/strong&gt;’ from Muslim, who are living in the West, they are themselves contradicting the basics of the Liberalism/Secularism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Islamic Preachers are suffering from the huge disease of misunderstanding Secularism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;es, of course, secularism gives individuals the liberty of &lt;strong&gt;personal choice&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, if an individual chooses not to participate in Christmas celebrations according to his personal choice, then there is no issue with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the criticism is not upon the ‘personal choice’ of an individual person, but the criticism here is upon the ‘&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collective behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;' of the ‘Muslim Community’, where their religion Islam has ordered them ‘&lt;strong&gt;collectively&lt;/strong&gt;’ to neither marry the Kafirs, nor they are allowed to celebrate their festivals, nor to dress like them, nor to integrate in their society in any way. A paint shirt is a complete dress for men to hide their nakedness (i.e., 'Awrah) according to Islamic rules, but Islam still prohibits Muslim men from wearing a paint shirt, which is equal to integrating into the kafir society according to Islamic Sharia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam has thus killed this very basic ‘&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;personal choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;’ of an individual person by giving these &lt;strong&gt;collective orders&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, these teachings of Islam about the collective opposition to integration into Western society is a ‘&lt;strong&gt;Hate Speech&lt;/strong&gt;’ against others, and it is against the &lt;strong&gt;SPIRIT &lt;/strong&gt;of Secularism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;Secularism says it is a crime that people differentiate others on the basis of &lt;strong&gt;religion&lt;/strong&gt;, race or colour. But religious Muslims living in Western countries under Secularism are committing exactly this same crime by differentiating other people on the basis of religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muslim integration record into Western societies is very bad as compared to other foreign groups. They don’t allow their daughters to marry outsiders. They don’t put emphasis on education (compared to, say, immigrants from Asian countries). They tend to segregate into Muslim communities. They often don’t share the mainstream societies’ views on gender equality, homosexuality and other topics — even in the 2nd/3rd generation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a direct clash between Secular Human Values and the teachings of Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Without Integration, you have Balkanization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Balkanization&quot; of society refers to the fragmentation or division of a society into smaller, often hostile, groups based on ethnic, religious, cultural, or other identities. This term originates from the historical geopolitical fragmentation of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe, where multiple ethnic and national groups have experienced intense conflicts and division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Aspects of Balkanization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fragmentation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Society is split into smaller, distinct groups that identify strongly with their own community rather than the larger society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These groups may form along ethnic, religious, linguistic, or cultural lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hostility and Conflict&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The divisions often lead to tension, mistrust, and sometimes open conflict between different groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The groups may compete for resources, political power, or social influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakening of National Unity&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall unity and coherence of the nation-state are undermined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National identity becomes less significant compared to subgroup identities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Governance&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective governance becomes challenging as the society becomes polarized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policies and decisions may be contested or blocked by different groups, leading to political instability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social and Economic Consequences&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social cohesion is weakened, which can lead to decreased economic cooperation and development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communities may become isolated from each other, reducing opportunities for interaction and mutual understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prevention and Integration:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent Balkanization, efforts are often made to promote integration and unity within society. This can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encouraging Intercommunity Interaction&lt;/strong&gt;: Creating opportunities for different groups to interact and build mutual understanding. Unfortunately, Muslims segregate themselves and prefer to live and interact only with other Muslims. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education and Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: Teaching the importance of diversity, tolerance, and national unity. Unfortunately, Islam teaches no tolerance for other religions and national unity meany almost nothing to Muslims who are living in the western societies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intercommunity Marriages&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the best tools for fostering integration and avoiding Balkanization is inter-community marriages. Unfortunately, the rate of intercommunity marriages among Muslims is almost close to ZERO. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other communities (Jews, Christians, Hindus, or Atheist Chinese etc.) are integrating into the local Western societies without any problems. It is due to the reason that they have accepted that &lt;strong&gt;Secular Values&lt;/strong&gt; stand above all religions (while they stand for humanity, and humanity is above all religions). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Muslim community does not learn to give preference to the Human Secular Values above the hate teachings of the Quranic Kafirophobia, then they will never be able to integrate, even if they keep on living there for the next thousands of years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson is simple, HUMANITY stands above all religions. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Islamic Preachers come up with the following argument, in order to defend the Quranic teachings of non-integration:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;com-content-article__body&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secularism is against &lt;strong&gt;collectivism&lt;/strong&gt; and based upon ‘&lt;strong&gt;individualism&lt;/strong&gt;’ and talks about the rights and liberties of an individual person. It’s moral stance is that an individual person is allowed to do whatever he wishes to do, and let others do whatever they want to do. Therefore, when the Western people demands the ‘&lt;strong&gt;social integration&lt;/strong&gt;’ from Muslim, who are living in the West, they are themselves contradicting the basics of the Liberalism/Secularism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Islamic Preachers are suffering from the huge disease of misunderstanding Secularism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;es, of course, secularism gives individuals the liberty of &lt;strong&gt;personal choice&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, if an individual chooses not to participate in Christmas celebrations according to his personal choice, then there is no issue with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the criticism is not upon the ‘personal choice’ of an individual person, but the criticism here is upon the ‘&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collective behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;' of the ‘Muslim Community’, where their religion Islam has ordered them ‘&lt;strong&gt;collectively&lt;/strong&gt;’ to neither marry the Kafirs, nor they are allowed to celebrate their festivals, nor to dress like them, nor to integrate in their society in any way. A paint shirt is a complete dress for men to hide their nakedness (i.e., 'Awrah) according to Islamic rules, but Islam still prohibits Muslim men from wearing a paint shirt, which is equal to integrating into the kafir society according to Islamic Sharia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam has thus killed this very basic ‘&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;personal choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;’ of an individual person by giving these &lt;strong&gt;collective orders&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, these teachings of Islam about the collective opposition to integration into Western society is a ‘&lt;strong&gt;Hate Speech&lt;/strong&gt;’ against others, and it is against the &lt;strong&gt;SPIRIT &lt;/strong&gt;of Secularism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;Secularism says it is a crime that people differentiate others on the basis of &lt;strong&gt;religion&lt;/strong&gt;, race or colour. But religious Muslims living in Western countries under Secularism are committing exactly this same crime by differentiating other people on the basis of religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muslim integration record into Western societies is very bad as compared to other foreign groups. They don’t allow their daughters to marry outsiders. They don’t put emphasis on education (compared to, say, immigrants from Asian countries). They tend to segregate into Muslim communities. They often don’t share the mainstream societies’ views on gender equality, homosexuality and other topics — even in the 2nd/3rd generation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a direct clash between Secular Human Values and the teachings of Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Without Integration, you have Balkanization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Balkanization&quot; of society refers to the fragmentation or division of a society into smaller, often hostile, groups based on ethnic, religious, cultural, or other identities. This term originates from the historical geopolitical fragmentation of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe, where multiple ethnic and national groups have experienced intense conflicts and division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Aspects of Balkanization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fragmentation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Society is split into smaller, distinct groups that identify strongly with their own community rather than the larger society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These groups may form along ethnic, religious, linguistic, or cultural lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hostility and Conflict&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The divisions often lead to tension, mistrust, and sometimes open conflict between different groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The groups may compete for resources, political power, or social influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakening of National Unity&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall unity and coherence of the nation-state are undermined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National identity becomes less significant compared to subgroup identities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Governance&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective governance becomes challenging as the society becomes polarized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policies and decisions may be contested or blocked by different groups, leading to political instability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social and Economic Consequences&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social cohesion is weakened, which can lead to decreased economic cooperation and development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communities may become isolated from each other, reducing opportunities for interaction and mutual understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prevention and Integration:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent Balkanization, efforts are often made to promote integration and unity within society. This can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encouraging Intercommunity Interaction&lt;/strong&gt;: Creating opportunities for different groups to interact and build mutual understanding. Unfortunately, Muslims segregate themselves and prefer to live and interact only with other Muslims. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education and Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: Teaching the importance of diversity, tolerance, and national unity. Unfortunately, Islam teaches no tolerance for other religions and national unity meany almost nothing to Muslims who are living in the western societies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intercommunity Marriages&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the best tools for fostering integration and avoiding Balkanization is inter-community marriages. Unfortunately, the rate of intercommunity marriages among Muslims is almost close to ZERO. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other communities (Jews, Christians, Hindus, or Atheist Chinese etc.) are integrating into the local Western societies without any problems. It is due to the reason that they have accepted that &lt;strong&gt;Secular Values&lt;/strong&gt; stand above all religions (while they stand for humanity, and humanity is above all religions). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Muslim community does not learn to give preference to the Human Secular Values above the hate teachings of the Quranic Kafirophobia, then they will never be able to integrate, even if they keep on living there for the next thousands of years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson is simple, HUMANITY stands above all religions. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Religious individuals assert that the West and its values have contributed to the deterioration of the family unit and an increase in divorce rates. However, this argument is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that as humans have evolved and become less reliant on their families and tribes for survival, both the family system and tribal system have naturally weakened. This shift is a result of technological advancements and increased access to education and economic opportunities, rather than the granting of liberties to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unfair to place blame solely on women and their newly recognized human rights. The truth is that Islamic societies have historically exploited women, denying them fundamental rights and freedoms. The West, on the other hand, has worked towards recognizing and protecting these rights, thereby promoting gender equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline of the extended family system and the rise in divorce rates cannot be attributed to women's empowerment alone; men must also take responsibility for their role in these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The divorce rate in Kuwait has reached 60% &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200212124308/http://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/divorce-rate-kuwait-reaches-alarming-60-percent-year-interest-driven-marriages/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The divorce rate in Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and UAE has risen above 35%(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/jordan-ranks-3rd-divorce-rates-arab-world-%E2%80%94-report&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Even in Saudi Arabia, the divorce rate has reached 33%(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/saudi-arabia-sees-7-divorce-cases-every-hour-1.85135151&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;post-title-t3_1e30oxn&quot; slot=&quot;title&quot; class=&quot;font-semibold text-neutral-content-strong m-0 text-18 xs:text-24  mb-xs px-md xs:px-0 xs:mb-md &quot;&gt;Malaysia: Increasing trend of married couples choosing a childfree lifestyle (&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.malaysiakini.com/news/711829&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam has remained unchanged in these Arab countries until now, but the countries themselves have become wealthier. Arab women no longer require their husbands' financial support to survive, so they refuse to tolerate exploitation and instead choose to separate through divorce (just like Western women).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, women still don't have full human rights in these Arabic countries, but becoming wealthy has led to a higher divorce rate than in many Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might this be the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation is that marriages are still arranged in these Arab countries, leaving people little chance to find a suitable partner before getting married. As a result, many arranged marriages turn out to be mismatches, which could contribute to the high divorce rate in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrastingly, in poor, secular countries like Vietnam, the divorce rate remains low due to the necessity of a strong family unit for survival. Similarly, China, an atheist nation, had a low divorce rate for centuries until it experienced economic growth and the need for a robust family system diminished. Now, as Vietnam and China have become wealthier, their divorce rates are also increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the decline of the traditional family structure and the rise in divorce rates are not solely caused by women's liberation or Western influence. Rather, they are the result of broader social, economic, and technological developments that have led to greater individual independence and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If Muslim men want to make the rate of divorce ZERO, then they should bear children only from Slave women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some Muslims who are such stubborn that they openly say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The older system was better where a woman was not allowed to go outside the house. Now they go outside, get education, get self-dependent, and then they try to get their independence from their husbands through divorce. This is the main reason of increase of divorce rate in Islamic countries. This liberty to women should be stopped while children are being effected do to higher divorce rate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these Muslim men have problems with the rate of divorce, then they should not marry women, but they should take only &quot;Slave Women&quot; to their homes and bear children only from them. Please be assured that Islam gave absolutely no human rights to the Slave women. In the case of a free Muslim wife, there are some chances of divorce, but in the case of slave women, your so-called Family System will become perfectly secure, and these slave women will never be able to break your family system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are unable to get slave women today from the outside world, then just snatch away all the remaining rights from your own free Muslim wives, and convert them into slaves, so that your family system stays stable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All psychiatrists agree that even a single parent is capable of providing a &quot;good enough upbringing&quot; to children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children are perfectly safe in Western countries, even in cases of divorce. In the event of a separation, children continue to have regular contact with both their mother and father, and both parents contribute to their upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #f8cac6;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While all psychiatrists concur that an intact family system is ideal for children, they also recognize that a single parent can still provide a &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;good enough&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;upbringing&lt;/span&gt;&quot; that allows children to grow into responsible members of society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that even a single mother is capable of providing her children with a standard upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home of a single parent is often a better environment for children compared to a household where the mother is subjected to abuse and mistreatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Islamic preachers may disagree, but it is a reality that many Pakistani/Bengali/Indian Muslim men leave their families behind to work in Gulf countries, resulting in their wives raising their children alone as single parents. These children may not see their fathers for extended periods, yet they still thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the same situation occurs in Europe, then Islamic preachers start claiming that there are numerous issues with single-parent households. They fail to acknowledge that in European societies, fathers typically maintain regular contact with their children, including weekend visits and holiday time, which amounts to more interaction than children of absent fathers in Gulf countries experience.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many knowledgeable Muslims who are doubtful about Islam. However, their journey of doubting Islam often ends with the question, &quot;What existed before the Big Bang?&quot; And when they fail to find an answer to this question, they continue to cling to Islam and accept Allah as a true god. But this is wrong, and it occurs only when they believe that leaving Islam requires denying the existence of any deity (i.e., becoming atheists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumption is incorrect. There is no requirement to reject the existence of any deity to abandon Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science has yet to discover the origin of matter. Therefore, until this question is fully addressed by science, every atheist will retain some degree of agnosticism – between 0.01% and 49%. That is, the possibility remains that one or more deities may exist.

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is not necessary to find the answer first regarding the origin of matter in order to leave religion. Rather, we only need to deny any religion that claims its &quot;religious god&quot; communicated messages to humans through angels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the debate over the existence or nonexistence of any deity is an internal discussion among atheists, agnostics, and deists. In contrast, the conversation with religious individuals focuses solely on their &quot;religious god.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d; background-color: #ecf0f1;&quot;&gt;Moreover, do you know that some Islamic Preachers are teaching these &lt;strong&gt;TACTICS&lt;/strong&gt; to Muslims in &lt;strong&gt;private gatherings&lt;/strong&gt; that they should engage us only in the discussion if god exists or not so that we don't get a chance to do &lt;strong&gt;Direct Criticism&lt;/strong&gt; upon Islam, Muhammad and Islamic Sharia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost impossible for Islamic apologists to answer the direct criticism of Islam/Sharia in the light of humanity and modern science. Whether it is Islamic Slavery, oppression against women, rape of minor girls in the name of marriage, or scientific mistakes in the Quran and Hadith, then the religious god (i.e. Allah) is immediately EXPOSED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, please don't get into the trap of Islamic preachers, and don't indulge in an unnecessary debate about the existence of god, but target and criticize Islam, Muhammad and Sharia directly in the first step and prove them wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Dialogue with a Muslim preacher:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Muslim preacher came up with this argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am ready to become an atheist if atheists could answer these questions (1) Where the matter came from (2) How the life began in that matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of a &quot; Religious God&quot; is the real issue between atheists and Muslims, not the origins of matter or life. When we see scientific errors in the Quran or Islam promoting tyranny, it suggests that Allah doesn't exist and Muhammad fabricated revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the source of matter is an &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;internal debate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; among atheists, agnostics, and deists. More crucially, the existence of any deity is a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secondary concern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for them since they agree that no god intervenes in earthly affairs. As a result, they create systems based on reason rather than faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike believers of various religions who fight and kill each other over their beliefs, atheists, agnostics, and deists do not engage in such violence. You never hear that any atheist has killed any agnostic person, by blaming him to be misguided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, you don't need to become an atheist to leave Islam, nor do you need answers to questions like where matter came from or how life began. However, if it's proven that your religious god makes scientific blunders and goes against humanity, that's enough reason to leave Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many knowledgeable Muslims who are doubtful about Islam. However, their journey of doubting Islam often ends with the question, &quot;What existed before the Big Bang?&quot; And when they fail to find an answer to this question, they continue to cling to Islam and accept Allah as a true god. But this is wrong, and it occurs only when they believe that leaving Islam requires denying the existence of any deity (i.e., becoming atheists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumption is incorrect. There is no requirement to reject the existence of any deity to abandon Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science has yet to discover the origin of matter. Therefore, until this question is fully addressed by science, every atheist will retain some degree of agnosticism – between 0.01% and 49%. That is, the possibility remains that one or more deities may exist.

&lt;p&gt;Surely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when we call ourselves 'Mulhid', we are essentially introducing ourselves as someone who has deviated from the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of 'Ilhaad' is to deviate from the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/41.40&quot;&gt;41:40&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #f80404;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;يُلْحِدُونَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; فِىٓ ءَايَٰتِنَا لَا يَخْفَوْنَ عَلَيْنَآ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, those who inject &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deviation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; into Our verses are not concealed from Us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.180&quot;&gt;7:180&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ فَٱدْعُوهُ بِهَا ۖ وَذَرُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #f80404;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;يُلْحِدُونَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; فِىٓ أَسْمَٰٓئِهِۦ ۚ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Allah (are) the names - the most beautiful, so invoke Him by them. And leave those who &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deviate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; concerning His names&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does the term 'Ilhaad' truly represent our ideology or identity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atheism means not believing in the existence of any god.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Ilhaad&lt;/em&gt; means deviation from the right path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheism means not believing in the existence of any god, while Ilhaad means deviation from the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term 'Atheism' is clear enough to convey our identity, but the term 'Ilhaad' has nothing in common with our ideology or identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the term 'Ilhaad' was never linked to atheism. Instead, anyone who deviated from the beliefs ('Aqaid') of orthodox Muslims, even if they were Muslim and believed in Allah, was declared a 'Mulhid'&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mirrat.com/article/38/883&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is simple logic that we should prefer terminology that best represents our ideology. We should avoid terminology that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insults or abuses us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has no connection to our ideology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was chosen by our opponents to insult and humiliate us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is our right, not our opponents', to decide the terminology that represents us the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The best alternative terminology for &lt;em&gt;Ilhaad/Mulhid&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best approach seems to be adopting the terminology of Atheism/Atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Islam is recognized globally as &quot;Islam,&quot; it would be more effective if &quot;Atheism&quot; and &quot;Atheist&quot; were globally used across different languages and regions without fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, terms like Deism and Agnosticism should also be used consistently as universal terminologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, certain Islamic terms pose issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kafir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Murtad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mulhid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These terms are often used to insult or demean opponents according to Islamic texts and interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more respectful and accurate approach would be to use alternative terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kafir&lt;/strong&gt; → Non-Muslim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Murtad&lt;/strong&gt; → Ex-Muslim&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Is a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship immoral?</title>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers, both Shia and Sunni, argue that a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship is equivalent to fornication and is immoral. Let's examine their claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A question from Shia apologists: What differentiates a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship from Shia Mutah?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Shia Muslims!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ponder upon it that Mutah doesn't require a witness. If a girl and a boy both consent, they can perform Mutah privately, without any witnesses. This consent is similar in both Mutah and the girlfriend/boyfriend relationship. So, how does Mutah become a blessing while the girlfriend/boyfriend relationship becomes obscene and immoral?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When posed with this question, Shia apologists typically respond by highlighting two key differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutah has an 'iddah (waiting period), whereas a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship lacks such a period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Mutah, the father is responsible for the child's expenses if a child is born.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no waiting period for a minor girl in Shia Islam. She does not need any waiting period in order to enter into the next Mutah relationship and can be immediately handed over to another man by her guardian in Mutah. Similarly, an old woman also does not need any waiting period for the next Mutah in Shia Islam (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.al-islam.org/five-schools-islamic-law-muhammad-jawad-mughniyya/al-iddah&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia scholars explain that a minor girl or an old woman doesn’t need the waiting period while this waiting period is only meant to determine the parentage of the child, just like in Sunni Islam the ‘iddah (waiting period) of prisoner or slave woman is to become free of first menstruation blood in three to seven days, as it happened in case of Saffiyyah that she became free of her menstruation blood the day that Muslims killed his father, brother and husband, and Muhammad than had sex with her the same night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if, according to Shia Ulama, the waiting period was solely intended for determining the parentage of the child, then it's arguable that observing this waiting period is unnecessary in modern times. After all, a quick medical test can easily establish whether a woman is pregnant or not, and DNA testing can identify the father of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why do Shia apologists still consider a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship immoral, even though the issue of parentage has been resolved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the second argument - that the father takes responsibility for the child in Mutah and bears the expenses - it can be pointed out that in Western countries, the boyfriend also takes responsibility as the father of the child. If he refuses, then courts will compel the father to provide for the child financially, regardless of whether the parents are married or not. The child also has rights to the father's property, just like any other child born within a traditional marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the father wants to participate in the upbringing of the child alongside the mother, courts often grant them this right. The father may even gain full custody of the child if the mother is deemed unsuitable for raising the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Mutah is perpetrating injustice against the mother in this case, if a woman becomes pregnant through Mutah and gives birth to a child, the father will obtain custody of the child, leaving the mother completely deprived of her infant. Please see, is this not an injustice towards the mother?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A sexual relationship with a slave woman (i.e. her RAPE) in Sunni Islam is a crime against humanity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Sunni Muslims!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists are strange. They blame Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationships as being immoral, but they forget that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islam allows the owner to rape the slave/captive woman without her consent. However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And this rape is done in TEMPORARY sexual relationships (just like Shia Mut'ah). This means when the Muslim owner fulfilled his lust and got bored of her, then he handed her over to his brother or slave. And once all of his brothers and slaves also fulfilled their lust and raped her one by one, then she was sold to the 2nd master, while the 1st master bought a new slave girl from the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery and started raping that new slave girl. And the 2nd master again raped the poor slave girl and then sold her to the 3rd master ... and thus the rape of the poor slave girl continued by multiple Muslim men. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no witness needed if an owner wants to have sex with his slave woman. Again, there is no witness needed if the owner hands her over to any of his brothers or slaves to rape her. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still blame the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship for being immoral unilaterally, while they don't need any witness for their relationship. Nevertheless, they forget the absence of witnesses in the case of Islam. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a slave girl is the property of 2 to 5 owners, then all of them can rape her one by one. In this case, the child will have 2 to 5 OFFICIAL fathers.&lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the owner becomes doubtful about the child (while he handed her over to his slaves or brothers in temporary sexual relationships), then he can also deny the parentage of his own child. In this case, his own son/daughter will become his slave, and he is allowed to make money by selling his own son/daughter in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery as slaves. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Muslim owner gets lust for the wife of his slave, then Islam allows him that he can break their family, and take the wife of his slave for himself. And after raping her and fulfilling his lust, she gave return her to his slave. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a Muslim man gets lust for the slave girl of another Muslim owner, then Islam allows them to SWAP their slave girls with each other, and rape the poor slave girls. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The child always belonged to the owner, while the slave mother of that child had no right to custody of her child. The owner can sell her to any other person in the original Islamic Sharia. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: Shia Islam also has 100% exactly the same Rulings as Sunni Islam has when it comes to the rape of slave girls. Please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=150&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Rape of slave women in Shia Islam&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Sunni and Shia Muslims, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't forget that you are humans first, and Muslims/Sunni later. Humanity demands that you ponder upon these facts and decide about the truth with justice and without any bias. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers, both Shia and Sunni, argue that a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship is equivalent to fornication and is immoral. Let's examine their claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A question from Shia apologists: What differentiates a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship from Shia Mutah?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Shia Muslims!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ponder upon it that Mutah doesn't require a witness. If a girl and a boy both consent, they can perform Mutah privately, without any witnesses. This consent is similar in both Mutah and the girlfriend/boyfriend relationship. So, how does Mutah become a blessing while the girlfriend/boyfriend relationship becomes obscene and immoral?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When posed with this question, Shia apologists typically respond by highlighting two key differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutah has an 'iddah (waiting period), whereas a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship lacks such a period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Mutah, the father is responsible for the child's expenses if a child is born.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no waiting period for a minor girl in Shia Islam. She does not need any waiting period in order to enter into the next Mutah relationship and can be immediately handed over to another man by her guardian in Mutah. Similarly, an old woman also does not need any waiting period for the next Mutah in Shia Islam (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.al-islam.org/five-schools-islamic-law-muhammad-jawad-mughniyya/al-iddah&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia scholars explain that a minor girl or an old woman doesn’t need the waiting period while this waiting period is only meant to determine the parentage of the child, just like in Sunni Islam the ‘iddah (waiting period) of prisoner or slave woman is to become free of first menstruation blood in three to seven days, as it happened in case of Saffiyyah that she became free of her menstruation blood the day that Muslims killed his father, brother and husband, and Muhammad than had sex with her the same night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if, according to Shia Ulama, the waiting period was solely intended for determining the parentage of the child, then it's arguable that observing this waiting period is unnecessary in modern times. After all, a quick medical test can easily establish whether a woman is pregnant or not, and DNA testing can identify the father of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why do Shia apologists still consider a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship immoral, even though the issue of parentage has been resolved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the second argument - that the father takes responsibility for the child in Mutah and bears the expenses - it can be pointed out that in Western countries, the boyfriend also takes responsibility as the father of the child. If he refuses, then courts will compel the father to provide for the child financially, regardless of whether the parents are married or not. The child also has rights to the father's property, just like any other child born within a traditional marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the father wants to participate in the upbringing of the child alongside the mother, courts often grant them this right. The father may even gain full custody of the child if the mother is deemed unsuitable for raising the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Mutah is perpetrating injustice against the mother in this case, if a woman becomes pregnant through Mutah and gives birth to a child, the father will obtain custody of the child, leaving the mother completely deprived of her infant. Please see, is this not an injustice towards the mother?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A sexual relationship with a slave woman (i.e. her RAPE) in Sunni Islam is a crime against humanity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Sunni Muslims!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists are strange. They blame Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationships as being immoral, but they forget that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islam allows the owner to rape the slave/captive woman without her consent. However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And this rape is done in TEMPORARY sexual relationships (just like Shia Mut'ah). This means when the Muslim owner fulfilled his lust and got bored of her, then he handed her over to his brother or slave. And once all of his brothers and slaves also fulfilled their lust and raped her one by one, then she was sold to the 2nd master, while the 1st master bought a new slave girl from the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery and started raping that new slave girl. And the 2nd master again raped the poor slave girl and then sold her to the 3rd master ... and thus the rape of the poor slave girl continued by multiple Muslim men. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no witness needed if an owner wants to have sex with his slave woman. Again, there is no witness needed if the owner hands her over to any of his brothers or slaves to rape her. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still blame the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship for being immoral unilaterally, while they don't need any witness for their relationship. Nevertheless, they forget the absence of witnesses in the case of Islam. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a slave girl is the property of 2 to 5 owners, then all of them can rape her one by one. In this case, the child will have 2 to 5 OFFICIAL fathers.&lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the owner becomes doubtful about the child (while he handed her over to his slaves or brothers in temporary sexual relationships), then he can also deny the parentage of his own child. In this case, his own son/daughter will become his slave, and he is allowed to make money by selling his own son/daughter in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery as slaves. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Muslim owner gets lust for the wife of his slave, then Islam allows him that he can break their family, and take the wife of his slave for himself. And after raping her and fulfilling his lust, she gave return her to his slave. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a Muslim man gets lust for the slave girl of another Muslim owner, then Islam allows them to SWAP their slave girls with each other, and rape the poor slave girls. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The child always belonged to the owner, while the slave mother of that child had no right to custody of her child. The owner can sell her to any other person in the original Islamic Sharia. &lt;br /&gt;However Islamic apologists still claim Islam to be moral and the Girlfriend/Boyfriend relationship to be immoral. &lt;/li&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Religious proponents often argue that it is crucial to shield humanity from atheism, contending that individuals in distress require support and hope to cultivate patience, which they assert are absent in atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counterargument:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous atheist and non-religious societies, such as those in China, Vietnam, and parts of Africa, have thrived for millennia. If reliance on divine hopes were essential, these societies would have struggled to sustain themselves through early generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human mind is capable of providing the necessary support and preparation to face challenging situations. For instance, when faced with the prospect of death, it is the mind that rationalizes and accepts death as a reality. The mind might further perceive death as a form of relief or transition, leading to a sense of peace. Consequently, atheists often exhibit greater tranquility at the time of death compared to their religious counterparts [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=35d941dabb9e38bf&amp;amp;rlz=1C1UEAD_enDE1115DE1115&amp;amp;sxsrf=ADLYWII9sedvCn2SUnlplQs41N_m_i5e9Q:1719372420073&amp;amp;q=interviews+of+people+before+Euthanasia&amp;amp;tbm=vid&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;fbs=AEQNm0AUODpJbqq0mCdJBye7JMOQ5bAjw92kcieO84oqGXMBrMqdVtaKb3_M1iMMbBKHuF8AFD-wVAkFOBrYAZ1Qkyn8qWEMWhbY9-Z43doZu51Vrd2A30EFqu2rHMH-5Ax1FejwIM3CSs6_nVNdqhq-MsN5z_KZ4CVwOhCnUBPLIKvsl_Nlm2yCIsAO_dB9IUaJCi52VP4RHbwG0xtQeYrRCoY6Sq-hJg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwix5dayqfiGAxX2ElkFHZ-QAH0Q0pQJegQIEBAB&amp;amp;biw=1163&amp;amp;bih=501&amp;amp;dpr=1.65&quot;&gt;Interviews of mostly irreligious people before Euthanasia where they are calm as they are mentally ready to die&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when confronted with injustice, the mind recognizes that the universe does not inherently operate on principles of justice. Instead, concepts of justice have been developed by human beings through the process of evolution to enhance societal well-being. The mind encourages persistence and patience in the face of injustice, fostering the courage to confront and address such issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Preparation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, there is no situation in the world for which the human mind cannot prepare an individual. Once mentally prepared, individuals do not require additional external hopes or support from a deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Considerations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious individuals often rely on divine hope, which may result in a lack of mental preparation for adverse situations. When these hopes are unfulfilled, the resultant disillusionment can exacerbate their distress. Additionally, false hopes can prevent individuals from addressing real issues effectively, leading to poor decision-making and increased vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, religious individuals may allocate their resources—time, energy, and money—towards prayers and sacrifices rather than resolving underlying problems. This diversion of resources can hinder the practical resolution of issues, perpetuating reliance on divine intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<title>Islamists: Atheists cannot Explain why Sex with a Dead Body is Immoral</title>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers argue against the establishment of a non-religious non-religious secular system by suggesting that without the strict laws of Allah's Sharia system, non-religious people will start raping their mothers and sisters and dead bodies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-religious society can adequately protect its members from harm through the use of reason, logic, and wise decision-making. It does not require the presence of a deity to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is disturbingly common in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for perpetrators to rape the deceased bodies of women and girls. This heinous act is attributed to the fact that the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unnatural&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; religious system of the Islamic Hijab and Gender Segregation creates an environment of extreme &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Frustration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; within society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of people exhuming the bodies of recently buried women and girls from graves and raping them are frequent in Pakistani newspapers. This phenomenon has reached alarming levels, prompting families of the deceased to mount vigils over their loved ones' graves for several nights to prevent desecration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+woman+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;amp;oq=dead+woman+raped+in+Pakistan+&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.13885j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Please see this link&lt;/a&gt; and you will find many incidents about the rape of dead women/girls in Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The foremost Reason for such behaviour (like raping dead bodies or indulging in incest) is Sexual Frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By employing our rational thinking, it was straightforward for us to identify the primary factor behind such behavior, which is sexual frustration. We don't need divine intervention to comprehend the root cause of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have determined the underlying cause, the next logical step is to devise solutions using our intellectual faculties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the problem, we lifted the unnatural constraints on the interaction between men and women, thereby alleviating sexual frustration in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an individual still harbours such desires despite these measures, it suggests that they are struggling with mental health issues and require professional assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in a secular society, we used our intellect to find a solution to this issue by declaring such acts to be criminal offenses. This was done to protect members of our society from physical and psychological harm. Similarly, just as some men in non-religious societies may have a tendency towards drug use, society as a whole declares it illegal to safeguard its members from harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As non-religious individuals, we recognize that nature is not flawless. Our world is not purely black and white. There are certainly individuals in society who have inclinations towards criminal activities and fetishistic fantasies. Due to this imperfection of nature, we must utilize our intellect to devise solutions to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If religious people say that they don't rape dead people only while their Allah prohibited it, then we tell them simply that we don't rape dead people while our society has collectively found that raping a dead body is harmful and thus we declared it a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results speak for themselves, due to unnatural restrictions on interaction between men and women, Islamic societies are suffering from extreme Sexual Frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only Islamic Pakistani society is ahead in raping the dead bodies of women/girls, but they are also at the top of the list in watching porn films in the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, not only porn films, but Pakistani Society is No. 1 in watching &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INCEST PORN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (as sister fuck, mother fuck, daughter fuck, donkey fuck) in the whole world for the last 2 decades (according to Google Trends).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the links about Pakistanis being No. 1 in search of incest porn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Today, some Islamic apologists argue that the traffic data from websites like Hubporn.com indicates that no one from Islamic countries visits such sites. However, this argument is flawed because it fails to account for the fact that most Islamic countries have banned access to pornographic websites. As a result, people in these countries who wish to access such content must use virtual private networks (VPNs) to do so. Therefore, the traffic data provided by Islamic apologists is misleading and does not accurately reflect the reality of pornography consumption in Islamic countries.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Tehrir Square (Egypt) Incident: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This one video is enough to see the sexual frustration among the Muslim masses due to unnatural restrictions in the name of the Hijab and modesty. This is much more dangerous than the incident of Muslim men digging graves and raping dead women/girls.
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zys959EGXWo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; sandbox=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muslim Women are abused and harassed by Men during the most spiritual event of Hajj&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the supposedly sacred event of Hajj, many Muslim women have reported experiencing harassment and abuse at the hands of men. Despite the spiritual nature of the gathering, men are unable to control their behaviour and take advantage of the combined presence of men and women. This is the only event in Islam where men and women are present in a mixed gathering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a stark contrast to the behaviour of non-Muslims who attend disco events, where music and dance are often present, yet instances of harassment and abuse are significantly lower. In fact, the supposedly &quot;Haram&quot; nature of music and dance in Islam does not seem to have a negative impact on the behaviour of non-Muslims, who are able to enjoy themselves without resorting to inappropriate behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;476&quot; height=&quot;591&quot; style=&quot;border: none; overflow: hidden;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&amp;amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdeutschewellenews%2Fvideos%2F10155631406919440%2F&amp;amp;show_text=true&amp;amp;width=476&amp;amp;t=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; sandbox=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intellect guides us that this same sexual frustration leads the men towards even raping the dead bodies of women/girls in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muslim Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslims can hit their wives and cannot say that hitting a wife is wrong because it is written in their book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The dilemma faced by Muslims is that they are unable to engage in open and honest discussions about controversial topics such as sleeping with dead bodies and sex slavery, as they feel compelled to defend their religious beliefs rather than critically evaluating them from various perspectives. Unlike non-religious individuals who can approach such issues from different angles, including ethical, moral, and harmful ones, Muslims are limited to defending their faith, even if they personally disagree with certain aspects of it. This restriction hinders their ability to engage in meaningful dialogue and explore alternative viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objection: If Western societies allow for greater freedom of interaction between men and women, why do cases of rape and sexual assault still occur?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Muslim presented the following objection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West is not repressing sex, yet rape and assault happen here as well. Why is that happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nothing is 100% perfect in this imperfect world,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can use our intellect to solve most issues, but creating a 100% fault-free perfect system is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, when compared to the supposedly Perfect Islamic System of the supposedly 100% Perfect Allah, our non-religious system comes out on top in every field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Objection: But some individuals in Western countries support the idea of allowing necrophilia and incest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;An Islamic preacher raised this objection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There are individuals in Western societies who advocate for such morally reprehensible acts like necrophilia and incest. Doesn't this indicate a lack of moral guidance in non-religious societies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are individuals in Western societies who advocate for such morally reprehensible acts. Doesn't this indicate a lack of moral guidance in non-religious societies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's true that some individuals in non-religious societies may voice their support for extreme ideas like necrophilia and incest, this does not indict the entire non-religious population. In fact, it's a sign of a healthy society that allows for freedom of speech and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to remember that humans are imperfect, and there will always be diverse opinions and perspectives within any given society. The key is to ensure that those voices are heard while still maintaining societal norms and laws that align with the values of the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, by permitting the expression of controversial viewpoints, we can engage in meaningful discussions and critiques that ultimately lead to better understanding and problem-solving. This process fosters evolution in both behaviour and legislation. Of course, mistakes can be made along the way, but the ability to learn from those errors and adapt accordingly is a hallmark of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what some Islamic preachers suggest, it's actually the Muslim world that struggles more with addressing certain issues. While it's possible to find individuals in the West who argue for the legalization of extreme practices, it's undeniable that these behaviours are generally considered taboo and are less prevalent due to societal pressures and legal frameworks&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (i.e. less widespread) ... Please see how Pakistani Muslims are also at top of the list in search of &quot;Donkey Rape&quot; along with &quot;Incest&quot; related search and in the incidents of necrophilia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Like Lawrence Krauss said, “reason and empathy”, and we will solve all problems sooner or later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m&quot;&gt;Reminder: Islam doesn't say anything about necrophilia, it's up to the opinions of scholars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Yes, in Islam, there is no verse nor a Hadith about necrophilia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It's left to the fallible human (i.e. Islamic Scholars) after Muhammad to decide on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The scholars of Fiqh agreed on the illegality of having sex with a dead person. However, they're split into two opinions on the punishment of the person who does it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In the &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/FPmfkmfk/mfk44/page/n30/mode/1up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Kuwaiti Encyclopedia of Jurisprudence&lt;/a&gt;, the two views are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hanafis, Shāfi'is (in the more sound view) and Hanbalis (in the accepted view) say that there is no Hadd for the person committing necrophilia, that is because having sex with a dead person is like not having sex because it is (the sex) done with a wasted organ, and &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;because having sex with the dead woman is undesirable&lt;/strong&gt;, in fact, it's something that the &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;[human] nature&lt;/strong&gt; would have an aversion to and &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;people would&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;be disgusted by&lt;/strong&gt;. So there is no need for establishing a Hadd as a deterrence. But a Ta'zir should be done on the person committing such an act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Mālikis, Shāfi'i (the opposing view) and some Hanbalis are on imposing the Hadd punishment on the doer, and this is the view of al-Awzā'i. They argued that it's because it's similar to having sex with a live woman and because it's &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;a graver sin for violating the sanctity of the dead&lt;/strong&gt;. The Malikis excluded the dead wife and stated that there is no Hadd on the husband for having sex with his own dead wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So, what are the reasons for the scholars?:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Appeal to disgust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Appeal to nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Argument from analogy. Their Qiyas is broken and error-prone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;As you can see there is no evidence from the Quran or the Hadith that says anything about the matter, there is only the guesswork of the scholars. Even the Ta'zir punishment is subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;PS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslims are so ashamed of this today, that when an Egyptian Preacher repeated the same fatwa that a man can have sex with his dead wife, he was prohibited from appearing anymore on TV. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210502095004/https://english.alarabiya.net/amp/variety/2017/09/19/-Nikah-Mufti-forbidden-to-screen-on-Egyptian-channels&quot;&gt;Here you can read about it&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers argue against the establishment of a non-religious non-religious secular system by suggesting that without the strict laws of Allah's Sharia system, non-religious people will start raping their mothers and sisters and dead bodies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-religious society can adequately protect its members from harm through the use of reason, logic, and wise decision-making. It does not require the presence of a deity to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is disturbingly common in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for perpetrators to rape the deceased bodies of women and girls. This heinous act is attributed to the fact that the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unnatural&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; religious system of the Islamic Hijab and Gender Segregation creates an environment of extreme &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Frustration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; within society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of people exhuming the bodies of recently buried women and girls from graves and raping them are frequent in Pakistani newspapers. This phenomenon has reached alarming levels, prompting families of the deceased to mount vigils over their loved ones' graves for several nights to prevent desecration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+woman+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;amp;oq=dead+woman+raped+in+Pakistan+&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.13885j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Please see this link&lt;/a&gt; and you will find many incidents about the rape of dead women/girls in Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The foremost Reason for such behaviour (like raping dead bodies or indulging in incest) is Sexual Frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By employing our rational thinking, it was straightforward for us to identify the primary factor behind such behavior, which is sexual frustration. We don't need divine intervention to comprehend the root cause of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have determined the underlying cause, the next logical step is to devise solutions using our intellectual faculties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the problem, we lifted the unnatural constraints on the interaction between men and women, thereby alleviating sexual frustration in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an individual still harbours such desires despite these measures, it suggests that they are struggling with mental health issues and require professional assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in a secular society, we used our intellect to find a solution to this issue by declaring such acts to be criminal offenses. This was done to protect members of our society from physical and psychological harm. Similarly, just as some men in non-religious societies may have a tendency towards drug use, society as a whole declares it illegal to safeguard its members from harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As non-religious individuals, we recognize that nature is not flawless. Our world is not purely black and white. There are certainly individuals in society who have inclinations towards criminal activities and fetishistic fantasies. Due to this imperfection of nature, we must utilize our intellect to devise solutions to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If religious people say that they don't rape dead people only while their Allah prohibited it, then we tell them simply that we don't rape dead people while our society has collectively found that raping a dead body is harmful and thus we declared it a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results speak for themselves, due to unnatural restrictions on interaction between men and women, Islamic societies are suffering from extreme Sexual Frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only Islamic Pakistani society is ahead in raping the dead bodies of women/girls, but they are also at the top of the list in watching porn films in the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, not only porn films, but Pakistani Society is No. 1 in watching &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INCEST PORN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (as sister fuck, mother fuck, daughter fuck, donkey fuck) in the whole world for the last 2 decades (according to Google Trends).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the links about Pakistanis being No. 1 in search of incest porn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Today, some Islamic apologists argue that the traffic data from websites like Hubporn.com indicates that no one from Islamic countries visits such sites. However, this argument is flawed because it fails to account for the fact that most Islamic countries have banned access to pornographic websites. As a result, people in these countries who wish to access such content must use virtual private networks (VPNs) to do so. Therefore, the traffic data provided by Islamic apologists is misleading and does not accurately reflect the reality of pornography consumption in Islamic countries.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Tehrir Square (Egypt) Incident: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This one video is enough to see the sexual frustration among the Muslim masses due to unnatural restrictions in the name of the Hijab and modesty. This is much more dangerous than the incident of Muslim men digging graves and raping dead women/girls.
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Muslim Women are abused and harassed by Men during the most spiritual event of Hajj&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the supposedly sacred event of Hajj, many Muslim women have reported experiencing harassment and abuse at the hands of men. Despite the spiritual nature of the gathering, men are unable to control their behaviour and take advantage of the combined presence of men and women. This is the only event in Islam where men and women are present in a mixed gathering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a stark contrast to the behaviour of non-Muslims who attend disco events, where music and dance are often present, yet instances of harassment and abuse are significantly lower. In fact, the supposedly &quot;Haram&quot; nature of music and dance in Islam does not seem to have a negative impact on the behaviour of non-Muslims, who are able to enjoy themselves without resorting to inappropriate behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Muslim Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In the &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/FPmfkmfk/mfk44/page/n30/mode/1up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Kuwaiti Encyclopedia of Jurisprudence&lt;/a&gt;, the two views are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hanafis, Shāfi'is (in the more sound view) and Hanbalis (in the accepted view) say that there is no Hadd for the person committing necrophilia, that is because having sex with a dead person is like not having sex because it is (the sex) done with a wasted organ, and &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;because having sex with the dead woman is undesirable&lt;/strong&gt;, in fact, it's something that the &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;[human] nature&lt;/strong&gt; would have an aversion to and &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;people would&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;be disgusted by&lt;/strong&gt;. So there is no need for establishing a Hadd as a deterrence. But a Ta'zir should be done on the person committing such an act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Mālikis, Shāfi'i (the opposing view) and some Hanbalis are on imposing the Hadd punishment on the doer, and this is the view of al-Awzā'i. They argued that it's because it's similar to having sex with a live woman and because it's &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;a graver sin for violating the sanctity of the dead&lt;/strong&gt;. The Malikis excluded the dead wife and stated that there is no Hadd on the husband for having sex with his own dead wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So, what are the reasons for the scholars?:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Appeal to disgust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Appeal to nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Argument from analogy. Their Qiyas is broken and error-prone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;As you can see there is no evidence from the Quran or the Hadith that says anything about the matter, there is only the guesswork of the scholars. Even the Ta'zir punishment is subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;PS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslims are so ashamed of this today, that when an Egyptian Preacher repeated the same fatwa that a man can have sex with his dead wife, he was prohibited from appearing anymore on TV. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210502095004/https://english.alarabiya.net/amp/variety/2017/09/19/-Nikah-Mufti-forbidden-to-screen-on-Egyptian-channels&quot;&gt;Here you can read about it&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Religious people present the following objection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to religion, if the oppressed victim doesn't get justice in this world against the tyrant, he still knows that Allah will punish the tyrant in the hereafter. But if a child is killed, and police is unable to catch the killer, how that child will get justice in a non-religious system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NATURE has no concept of justice and punishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is also no 'intelligent design' in Nature, and it does not aim to achieve any goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to nature, there are earthquakes, storms, floods, and hurricanes which kill thousands of people and destroy whole cities, but nature gets no punishment or reward for all these killings and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to nature, dinosaurs and millions of other species were wiped out even before the advent of humans (i.e. so-called Adam) on this earth. There was no goal involved in their coming or becoming non-existent before the arrival of humans. We don't even know about these millions of species which became non-existent before us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to nature, thousands of diseases come and kill millions of people. And their death is extremely slow and extremely painful. It is hundreds of times more painful as compared to when one person kills another person. So, who is responsible for all this extreme pain and long-suffering when a person is killed through these natural diseases, and how to punish the one who is responsible for it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And millions of children are born with birth defects and have to suffer the whole of their lives with extreme pain due to this. Who is then responsible, and who should be punished for that? &lt;strong&gt;If it was really Allah who gave them these diseases and pain, then shouldn't Allah be punished for this crime? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is, this system of justice and punishment is a man-made system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a killer does not get the punishment, then nature does not care about it (i.e. no natural disaster like flood or earthquakes etc. occur due to this). But if he does not get the punishment, then it is a mistake of society, and such a society will get the punishment in this world for this mistake (i.e. such a society get destroyed due to lack of justice system). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans got intelligence due to the process of evolution, and due to this intelligence, they tried to create an 'intelligent design' for themselves, which has an aim and which is based upon a system of justice and punishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since humans are not 100% PERFECT, thus the system of justice and punishment could also be never 100% perfect. It may be possible that a few criminals may dodge the system and do not get the punishment. &lt;strong&gt;But despite these few exceptional cases, our aim as a collective society is still achieved, and we indeed succeed in forming a society which could exist and progress through this system &lt;/strong&gt;(despite it being not 100% perfect). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of justice and punishment in the hereafter is only a Drama. No society could be formed on the basis of this concept of justice in the hereafter alone. If it was really possible, then no religious society would have introduced physical punishments in this world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;And if Islam claims that 'all the actions are based upon (إنما الأعمال بالنيات)', then what about those disabled children who are suffering a painful life or a person who is mentally disabled and suffering a painful life? They had neither any &quot;INTENTIONS&quot; of choosing this painful life for them, nor they had any &quot;CHOICE&quot;. And it is Allah who made them suffer without their intentions and choice. &lt;strong&gt;So, without this option of choice and intention, why then any pain and suffering and 'punishment or reward'? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff01d9;&quot;&gt;Moreover, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;it is your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;‘&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0901ff;&quot;&gt;mind&lt;/span&gt;’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff01d9;&quot;&gt;, which supports you and prepares you to face all kinds of terrible situations.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;For example, if you are close to death, then it is your mind which will prepare you to face it by presenting this argument that death is a reality, and the whole universe is functioning upon the same principle, then why fear death? It will further prepare you by giving this argument that death is a form of ‘blessing’ too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;The result of this mental preparation is that Atheists are often much more peaceful at the time of their death as compared to religious people. For example, please watch&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=interview+before+euthanasia&quot;&gt; videos of interviews&lt;/a&gt; of these people before Euthanasia (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hchSilp6Ecg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) and see how calm they are before death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;Similarly, if someone does any injustice to you, still it is your mind that guides you that this universe didn’t come into being on the principles of ‘justice’. And there is no principle of justice present within ‘nature’ itself, but these are human beings who developed the sense of justice during the process of evolution, and thus they try to uphold justice for the betterment of humanity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;It is your mind which will guide you if that person is strong, who is doing injustice to you, then we have to show ‘patience’ and we should be persistent in raising our voices against this injustice. Thus, our mind prepares us mentally to face injustices too with courage and bravery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0101;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In short, there is not a single situation in the world for which our mind could not prepare us mentally to face it. And once we are ready mentally, then we don’t need any other false hope and false support of any god. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		<title>Is premarital sex in the West breaking marriages later? </title>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers blame the non-religious Western society and claim: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual intercourse is something that should be kept treasured and specific to a loved one. But West glorifies sexual intercourse before marriage in the name of finding '&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;suitable partner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;', and it makes sex easier and without any punishment, which is a reason why cheating and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;divorces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are so common in today's western society. Sex is not something to be &lt;strong&gt;dished out&lt;/strong&gt; so both parties feel a hit of dopamine and leave each other. It demoralises the whole act making it more meaningless the more you enact with &lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;different partners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Islam gives a value to sex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and makes it a mean of love between &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;two parties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; i.e. husband and wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Islam does not give value to sex, but the correct statement is:  &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Islam gives value to MEN only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam allowed only men to marry 4 women and have sex with all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thus, according to the standards of Islamic preachers, dishing out sex with 4 women does not fit in the definition of LOVE between &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Parties&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This issue with Islam goes even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;A Muslim man is not only allowed to have 4 wives but he is also allowed to have sex with dozens of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So, how does sex with 4 different wives and dozens of slave women not constitute dishing out the sex? And how does it fit in the definition of love between &lt;strong&gt;Two Parties&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This issue with Islam goes even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslim men are practically &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;RAPING&lt;/strong&gt; the slave/prisoner women against their consent/will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There is a huge difference between sex and rape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Does raping the slave/prisoner women ever make a Muslim man a better person, who is then still capable of loving and taking care of any other woman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This issue with Islam goes even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam not only allowed men to have sex with slave women, but it also allowed them to have &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual Relationships&quot; with the slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;What does this &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual Relationship&quot; mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Have you heard of Shia Muta and Temporary sexual relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is the same in Sunni Islam where an owner can rape a slave woman in a &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Allah made it permissible for the Muslim owner after fulfilling his Lust in a Shia Mut'a type &quot;Temporary Sexual Relationship), if he got bored, then he could hand her over to one of his brothers (or even to any of his slaves). And after all of his brothers (/or slaves) had raped her one by one and fulfilled their lust and got bored, then she could be sold to the 2nd master, who again raped her, and then sold her to the 3rd master .... and thus, this cycle of rape continued for the poor slave-girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;0 Abu Sa'id al-Khadri said: We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired (to have sex with) them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;(but at the same time) we also desired good ransom money for them by selling them)&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing 'azl (i.e. withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception so that they don’t become pregnant)&lt;/strong&gt;. But then we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: (Yes, it is allowed, but) it does not matter if you do it or not, while if any soul has to be born up to the Day of Resurrection, then it will be born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The slave trade was made permissible by Allah, where all such captive women were sold after they had already been raped in temporary sexual relationships by their former Muslim owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But Islam claims such owners (men) are still able to love their wife/wives despite raping dozens of slave women in a temporary sexual relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This issue with Islam goes even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evil of 'Temporary Sexual Relationship' led to another evil, where the swapping of slave girls also became Halal (i.e. permissible). If a Muslim man got a lust for a slave girl of another person, he can simply offer that other man to swap their slave girls and rape them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tafsir-e-Mazhari is a commentary of the Quran, which is taught in every Hanafi school. It is written under the commentary of verse 33:52 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/swap_slave_girls_mazhari.jpg&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Zayd said about this verse {وَلَآ أَن تَبَدَّلَ بِهِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجٍ nor to exchange your present wives for other women (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.52&quot;&gt;Verse 33:52&lt;/a&gt;)} that people used to swap their wives during the era of ignorance ... upon that Allah revealed this verse and the swapping of wives is thus not allowed. But the slave women are not included in it, and you can swapp them and there is no issue in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This issue with Islam goes even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah/Muhammad allowed the master to snatch away the slave wife of his slave man, and to start raping her. And after he has fulfilled his lust and has gotten bored, then he can return that slave wife back to his slave man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5105/&quot; rel=&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot; data-ve-attributes=&quot;{&amp;quot;rel&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;mw:ExtLink&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 5105:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. There is no harm in a man (i.e the owner) taking his female slave (for himself) from his male slave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Does raping the slave wife of his male slave make that Muslim Master a better person, who is then still capable of loving and taking care of all of his wives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suitable partner vs GAMBLE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;If a Muslim woman is married to a Muslim man who is not compatible with her, then her whole life is ruined. Every Muslim girl is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;compelled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to play this &lt;strong&gt;GAMBLE&lt;/strong&gt;, while Islam snatches away this right from her to meet with different men, test them thoroughly, and then choose a suitable partner for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2572/limits-of-looking-at-ones-fiancee-and-the-ruling-on-touching-her-and-being-alone-with-her-is-her-permission-a-condition-of-being-allowed-to-look-at-her&quot;&gt;Ahadith of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, a male companion married after looking at the woman once (and not even talking to her once). This means, the female companion never talked to him and perhaps never saw him once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This leaves the woman with little chance of determining whether her potential husband is suitable or mentally compatible with her. Even if she does have a brief interaction with him before the wedding, it is often insufficient to uncover his true nature. Evil individuals can easily conceal their malevolent traits during these initial encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the arrangement of marriages by family members or guardians can lead to a lack of emotional connection and understanding between the couple. The focus is often on material possessions, social status, and family background, rather than on the compatibility of the couple. This can result in a loveless marriage, where the partners feel like strangers to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the cultural pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations can make it difficult for young Muslim women to express their own preferences and desires. They may be forced into a marriage that they do not want, leading to a lifetime of unhappiness and regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;As a result, the practice of arranged marriages in Islam is fundamentally flawed and poses a significant risk for every Muslim girl who enters into it and is always a gamble for every single Muslim girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The so-called STABILITY of the family system in Islamic society is based only upon the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;EXPLOITATION&lt;/span&gt; of women:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a man, Islam grants you the right to divorce your wife who causes trouble for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as a woman (wife), your life can be miserable since you have little chance of escaping an incompatible husband, even if he becomes abusive and beats you mercilessly, leaving bruises (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=20&amp;amp;catid=9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers might argue that a woman has the right to seek Khul' خلع (separation) to free herself from such a marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's a common misconception. Under authentic Islamic law, Khul' is not a woman's prerogative; it's the husband's privilege. In an Islamic Khul', the wife must offer her husband &lt;strong&gt;ransom &lt;/strong&gt;money, in exchange for her freedom. If the husband agrees to accept the offer and divorces her, she gains her liberty. However, if the husband refuses the offer, no Islamic court can force him to divorce her, obligating her to remain in such an abusive union for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read this article in order to understand the real Khu'l ruling in Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Are you able to see the &lt;strong&gt;RISK/Gamble&lt;/strong&gt; of the whole life of a Muslim girl in an Islamic system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Are you able to see how a woman is &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPLOITED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to stay with her husband despite non-compatibility, despite NO LOVE, despite him being abusive? The whole Islamic society pressurizes her not to get a divorce. In most cases, she is unable to support herself alone. It is difficult for her to go out in men's society and do any job. And the worst, in case if she remarries, then Islamic Sharia rules that she will lose the custody of all her children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;You have read it correctly, if she remarries, then Islamic Sharia snatches away all the children from her, while her duty is to please her 2nd husband sexually whenever he wishes, and Islamic Sharia considers that her children from her earlier husband are a hindrance in providing sexual services to her 2nd husband. Please read this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=12&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;Strange Islam: If a Divorced Woman Remarries, then she will lose the Custody of her Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please don't get confused by the present-day laws of Islamic countries, where they went against the original Islamic Sharia and where they allowed women to keep their children even if they remarry. &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers blame the non-religious Western society and claim: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual intercourse is something that should be kept treasured and specific to a loved one. But West glorifies sexual intercourse before marriage in the name of finding '&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;suitable partner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;', and it makes sex easier and without any punishment, which is a reason why cheating and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;divorces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are so common in today's western society. Sex is not something to be &lt;strong&gt;dished out&lt;/strong&gt; so both parties feel a hit of dopamine and leave each other. It demoralises the whole act making it more meaningless the more you enact with &lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;different partners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Islam gives a value to sex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and makes it a mean of love between &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;two parties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; i.e. husband and wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Islam does not give value to sex, but the correct statement is:  &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Islam gives value to MEN only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam allowed only men to marry 4 women and have sex with all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thus, according to the standards of Islamic preachers, dishing out sex with 4 women does not fit in the definition of LOVE between &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Parties&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This issue with Islam goes even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;A Muslim man is not only allowed to have 4 wives but he is also allowed to have sex with dozens of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So, how does sex with 4 different wives and dozens of slave women not constitute dishing out the sex? And how does it fit in the definition of love between &lt;strong&gt;Two Parties&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This issue with Islam goes even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslim men are practically &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;RAPING&lt;/strong&gt; the slave/prisoner women against their consent/will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There is a huge difference between sex and rape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Does raping the slave/prisoner women ever make a Muslim man a better person, who is then still capable of loving and taking care of any other woman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This issue with Islam goes even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam not only allowed men to have sex with slave women, but it also allowed them to have &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual Relationships&quot; with the slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;What does this &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual Relationship&quot; mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Have you heard of Shia Muta and Temporary sexual relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is the same in Sunni Islam where an owner can rape a slave woman in a &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Allah made it permissible for the Muslim owner after fulfilling his Lust in a Shia Mut'a type &quot;Temporary Sexual Relationship), if he got bored, then he could hand her over to one of his brothers (or even to any of his slaves). And after all of his brothers (/or slaves) had raped her one by one and fulfilled their lust and got bored, then she could be sold to the 2nd master, who again raped her, and then sold her to the 3rd master .... and thus, this cycle of rape continued for the poor slave-girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;As a result, the practice of arranged marriages in Islam is fundamentally flawed and poses a significant risk for every Muslim girl who enters into it and is always a gamble for every single Muslim girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The so-called STABILITY of the family system in Islamic society is based only upon the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;EXPLOITATION&lt;/span&gt; of women:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a man, Islam grants you the right to divorce your wife who causes trouble for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as a woman (wife), your life can be miserable since you have little chance of escaping an incompatible husband, even if he becomes abusive and beats you mercilessly, leaving bruises (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=20&amp;amp;catid=9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers might argue that a woman has the right to seek Khul' خلع (separation) to free herself from such a marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's a common misconception. Under authentic Islamic law, Khul' is not a woman's prerogative; it's the husband's privilege. In an Islamic Khul', the wife must offer her husband &lt;strong&gt;ransom &lt;/strong&gt;money, in exchange for her freedom. If the husband agrees to accept the offer and divorces her, she gains her liberty. However, if the husband refuses the offer, no Islamic court can force him to divorce her, obligating her to remain in such an abusive union for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read this article in order to understand the real Khu'l ruling in Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?view=article&amp;amp;id=33:khul%E2%80%99-%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%B9-i-e-getting-freedom-from-husband-is-not-the-%E2%80%9Cright%E2%80%9D-of-a-woman,-but-it-is-still-the-%E2%80%9Cright%E2%80%9D-of-a-husband-to-either-grant-it-or-to-deny-it-%E2%AD%90-%E1%B5%90%E1%B5%98%CB%A2%E1%B5%97%E2%81%BB%CA%B3%E1%B5%89%E1%B5%83%E1%B5%88-%E2%AD%90&amp;amp;catid=11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Khul’ خلع (i.e. getting freedom from a husband) is not the “right” of a woman, but it is still the “right” of a husband to either grant it or deny it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Are you able to see the &lt;strong&gt;RISK/Gamble&lt;/strong&gt; of the whole life of a Muslim girl in an Islamic system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Are you able to see how a woman is &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPLOITED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to stay with her husband despite non-compatibility, despite NO LOVE, despite him being abusive? The whole Islamic society pressurizes her not to get a divorce. In most cases, she is unable to support herself alone. It is difficult for her to go out in men's society and do any job. And the worst, in case if she remarries, then Islamic Sharia rules that she will lose the custody of all her children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;You have read it correctly, if she remarries, then Islamic Sharia snatches away all the children from her, while her duty is to please her 2nd husband sexually whenever he wishes, and Islamic Sharia considers that her children from her earlier husband are a hindrance in providing sexual services to her 2nd husband. Please read this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=12&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;Strange Islam: If a Divorced Woman Remarries, then she will lose the Custody of her Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please don't get confused by the present-day laws of Islamic countries, where they went against the original Islamic Sharia and where they allowed women to keep their children even if they remarry. &lt;/p&gt;

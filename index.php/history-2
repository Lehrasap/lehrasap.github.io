		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Throughout the entire Meccan period spanning 13 years, only a handful of people embraced Islam. Surprisingly, in Medina, a significant number of people converted to Islam even in Muhammad's absence. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the factors, which Muhammad used to spread Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower-status individuals with immature opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissatisfaction with the pagan religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power dynamics and politics (during the initial period of Medina)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coercion through Sword (during the later period of Medina)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) Lower-status People with immature opinions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the pagan Quraysh, only a small number of lower-status individuals believed in Muhammad's message due to their immaturity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamawakened.com/quran/11/27/default.htm&quot;&gt;11.27&lt;/a&gt;: The chiefs of the disbelieving nation said, &quot;We find you to be no more than a human like us, and we find that &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;only those of lower status and immature opinion follow you&lt;/span&gt;. We do not find you superior to us in any way. In fact, we think you are a liar!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the number of such people was very limited, and many of them were slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) Dissatisfaction with the Pagan Religion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagan religions often involved strange rituals that seemed nonsensical to many. In contrast, Muhammad's message of monotheism, focusing on one single god, was appealing to certain individuals. According to Muslim accounts, some pagans had already abandoned their faith to become Christians or followers of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif&quot;&gt;Hanif&lt;/a&gt; religion. However, their numbers remained relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Power dynamics and politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the entire Meccan period spanning 13 years, only a handful of people embraced Islam. Surprisingly, in Medina, a significant number of people converted to Islam even in Muhammad's absence. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in power dynamics and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medina was home to two major pagan Arab tribes, Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj, alongside three major Jewish tribes and several smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan Arabs, feeling inferior to the Jews due to their superior education, wealth, and fertile lands, gradually began to convert to Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2682&quot;&gt;Sunan Abi Dawud, 2682&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the children of a woman (in pre-Islamic days) did not survive, she took a vow on herself that if her child survives, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;she would convert it a Jew&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the pagan Arabs were also afraid of the Jews, as they used to hear from their Jewish neighbours that a prophet would be sent at the end of time and that the Jews would follow him and fight the Arabs along with him and kill them in the same manner in which the earlier nations of ‘Ad and Iram were killed and destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge civil war broke out in Medina, where al-Aws and al-Khazraj fought each other too. And when al-Aws lost a lot of wars against al-Khazraj, they went to seek the alliance of pagan Meccans, but they refused (Samhudi, Wafaa al-Wafaa, Vol. 1, p. 385). At that time Muhammad presented himself to them, seeking protection in Medina and telling them that he and his followers would then assist them. Some of them accepted Islam at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was soon followed by the war of Bu'ath (another civil war in Medinah). It took place 5 years before hijra (i.e. Muhammad's migration to Medina). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Aisha described this war:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3846&quot;&gt;3846&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Allah caused the day of Bu'ath to take place before Allah's Messenger (saw) was sent so that when he reached Medina, those people had already divided (in different groups) and their chiefs had been killed or wounded. So, Allah made that day precede Allah's Messenger (saw) so that they (i.e. the two pagan Arab tribes) might embrace Islam.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of their key leaders (those who had a similar mentality to ibn Ubbay) who could hinder the message of Muhammad were killed as well as large numbers of their followers. Thus, the new generation of two pagan Arab tribes wanted to unite again and utilised the offer of Muhammad. (Samhudi, Wafaa al-Wafaa, Vol. 1, p. 389, Shireef, Tarikh Makah wa al-Madinah, p. 367)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of the Jews to kill and destroy the polytheistic Arabs on the arrival of their next prophet also made al-Aws and al-Khazraj to accept Islam. As al-Aws and al-Khazraj collectively could exert control over the Jews, they received Muhammad and were able to launch the Islamic state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In Zad Al-Ma‘ad, Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/115459/reasons-why-al-aws-and-al-khazraj-tribes-embraced-islam#:~:text=It%20was%20one%20of%20the,would%20follow%20him%20and%20fight&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One of the things which Allah Almighty accomplished for His Messenger, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was that the tribes of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj heard from their allies from among the Jews of Al-Madeenah, that 'A Prophet will appear in our time and we will follow him and kill you, in the same manner in which ‘Ad and Iram were killed.' The Ansar used to perform Hajj, as did the Arabs, but not the Jews. So when they saw the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, inviting people to Allah during the season of Hajj and they observed his manners, some of them said to the others, &quot;&lt;em&gt;You know, by Allah, O people, that this is the prophet whom you were threatened with by the Jews, so do not let them precede you in following him. So hasten to accept his invitation.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(4) Not even 10 Jews believed in Muhammad due to the alleged greatest miracle of inimitability:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving in Medina, initially, Muhammad tried to please the Jews so that they accepted him as a true prophet. For this purpose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad started to copy a lot of Jewish Laws into Islamic Sharia. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also claimed the revelation of such verses, that were pleasing the Jews, like verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/29.46&quot;&gt;29:46&lt;/a&gt; {&lt;em&gt;Our God and your God is one, and to Him we submit&lt;/em&gt;}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also changed the Qibla from Ka'ba to the Jewish Temple (Bait-ul-Muqqadas) in Jerusalem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the Jews of Medina didn't believe in Islam and kept declaring Muhammad to be a false prophet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alleged inimitability and literary miracles of the Quran neither ever impressed the Pagans in Mecca, nor it ever impressed the Jews in Medina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This frustrated Muhammad so much, that he used to say even if 10 Jews believed in him, then all Jews would become Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3941&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 3941&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;arabic_sanad arabic&quot;&gt;عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;arabic_text_details arabic&quot;&gt;&quot;‏ لَوْ آمَنَ بِي &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;عَشَرَةٌ مِنَ الْيَهُودِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; لآمَنَ بِي الْيَهُودُ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;Had &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;only ten Jews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amongst their chiefs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;believe me, all the Jews would definitely have believed me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2793&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2793&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;arabic_sanad arabic&quot;&gt;عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;arabic_text_details arabic&quot;&gt;&quot;‏ لَوْ تَابَعَنِي &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;عَشْرَةٌ مِنَ الْيَهُودِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; لَمْ يَبْقَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهَا يَهُودِيٌّ إِلاَّ أَسْلَمَ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;If ten &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;scholars of the&lt;/span&gt; Jews would follow me, no Jew would be left upon the surface of the earth who would not embrace Islam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The Islamic Translators of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim added these words in parenthesis on their own &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #fcff01;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(amongst their chiefs)&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #fcff01;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scholars of the Jews&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It is a Distortion (TEHRIF) case, while these words have nothing to do with the original tradition, which is talking about normal 10 Jews, and not about any of their chiefs/scholars. Islamic preachers are compelled to do this TEHRIF (distortion) while it EXPOSES Islam and Muhammad, and Islamic preachers want to HIDE the Truth from the masses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distortion by Islamic preachers is utterly shameful and shows how dishonest they are and how ashamed they are of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems Muhammad repeated this statement multiple times, and his companion 'Auf ibn Malik is also a witness to a similar statement from him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;ID=22861&amp;amp;bk_no=6&amp;amp;flag=1&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal, Hadith 23464&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حدثنا أبو المغيرة قال حدثنا صفوان قال حدثنا عبد الرحمن بن جبير بن نفير عن أبيه عن عوف بن مالك قال انطلق النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يوما وأنا معه حتى دخلنا كنيسة اليهود بالمدينة يوم عيد لهم فكرهوا دخولنا عليهم فقال لهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: يا معشر اليهود أروني اثني عشر رجلا يشهدون أنه لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله يحبط الله عن كل يهودي تحت أديم السماء الغضب الذي غضب عليه&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated by Abu Al-Mugheera through Safwan through Abdul-Rahman ibn Jubayr through his father through 'Awf ibn Malik, who said: One day, the Prophet ﷺ and I went to a Jewish synagogue in Medina on one of their festivals. They hated that we made an appearance. The Prophet ﷺ said: &quot;O' Jewish tribe, show me twelve men from among you who testify that there is no deity but Allah,and that Muhammad is his messenger, and Allah will spare all the Jews under the visible heaven from the wrath He has upon them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/hadith/search?q=%D9%8A%D8%A7%20%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%AF%20%D8%A3%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%20%D8%A7%D8%AB%D9%86%D9%8A%20%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B1%20%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A7%20%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%20%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%87%20%D9%84%D8%A7%20%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%87%20%D8%A5%D9%84%D8%A7%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%20%D9%88%D8%A3%D9%86%20%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A7%20%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%84%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%20%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%B7%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%20%D8%B9%D9%86%20%D9%83%D9%84%20%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: Sahih (Albani)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Jews of Medina still refused to accept him as a true prophet, and that was the point where Muhammad's enmity and hatred started against the Jews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all, Muhammad changed the Qibla once again from Bait-ul-Muqqadas to Ka'ba in Mecca. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then he started openly threatening the Jews to accept Islam, otherwise, they would be expelled from Medina, and he would snatch away all of their lands by force. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3167&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 3167&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;While we were in the Mosque, the Prophet (ﷺ) came out and said, &quot;Let us go to the Jews&quot; We went out till we reached Bait-ul-Midras. He said to them,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0007ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &quot;If you embrace Islam, you will be safe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You should know &lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;that the earth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;belongs to Allah and His Apostle (only)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #007008;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;and I want to expel you from this land.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if anyone amongst you owns some property, he is permitted to sell it, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #007008;&quot;&gt;otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that was the whole argument of Muhammad: &quot;...&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle (only)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Please remember that Muhammad used the same argument to attack innocent Pagan tribes (who had nothing to do with Muhammad previously and had never attacked or harmed Muhammad). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3012:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Narrated As-Sab bin Jaththama: The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me at a place called Al-Abwa or Waddan, and was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, &quot;They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans).&quot; Prophet said: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the graze-lands belong to Allah and his prophet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Muhammad's anger and hatred against the Jews went so high that he was no more satisfied by expelling them from Medina, but he wanted to expel them from the whole Arab peninsula. It was due to the reason that it was a shame for him that he was claiming himself to be the promised prophet of the Jews, but the Jews were telling people that he was not that promised prophet. Muhammad didn't want the Jews to tell this to others, thus he wanted to expel them from the whole Arabian peninsula. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/32/75&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 1767(a)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been narrated by 'Umar b. al-Khattib that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and will not leave any but Muslim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(5) Pagans didn't accept Islam even after the Victory of Mecca:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the conquest of Mecca by Muhammad in the 7th year of Hijri, the pagan Meccans remained resistant to accepting Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to prevent opposition from the pagan leaders of Mecca, Muhammad offered stipends to them, fostering a sense of financial interest and aiming to ensure their compliance with Islam. Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.60&quot;&gt;9:60&lt;/a&gt;). But despite getting the stipends, they didn't accept Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(6) Pagans accepted Islam only after they were FORCED to do it under the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Fear of Sword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the situation was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native Arabic-speaking Pagans of Mecca were not accepting Islam due to its challenge of inimitability or any linguistic miracle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn't accept it after the conquer of Mecca in 7th Hijri year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn't accept it even after receiving stipends. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 9th Hijri year, Muhammad claimed the revelation of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.5&quot;&gt;9:5&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. the Verse of the Sword, which ordered to kill all polytheists after 4 months). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.5&quot;&gt;9:5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the sacred months have passed, then &lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kill the polytheists wherever you find them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;establish&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; prayer, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and give&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; zakah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;i.e. if they become Muslims&lt;/em&gt;), let them [go] on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad allowed the people of the book (i.e. Christians/Jews/Magians) to stay alive by paying Jizya tax, but he refused to accept any Jizya from polytheists. They either had to accept Islam, or they would be slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after that, pagan Arabs accepted Islam to save their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christians/Jews/Magians paid Jizya but didn't accept Islam. It was difficult for Muhammad to kill Christians and Jews as killing them for not accepting Islam would have angered the Christian Byzantine Empire while killing Magians would have angered the Magian Persian Empire. But pagan Arabs were vulnerable and they had no backing outside of Arabia. Therefore, Muhammad allowed them to stay alive by paying Jizya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to this forced conversion, we do see Christians and Jews in Arab countries, but no polytheists as all of them were forced to convert to Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(7) Reasons for Arab Success over &lt;span id=&quot;The_Romans_(Byzantines)_have_been_defeated_in_the_nearest_land_-_Quran_30:2-7&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Byzantines &lt;/span&gt;and Persians&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many books on this subject. For example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an excerpt of the latter on Page 272&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons For Arab Success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What had begun as an attempt on the part of Muhammad’s followers to claim and occupy what they regarded as their divinely promised patrimony in Palestine had therefore escalated into an extraordinary wave of conquests; these wiped the ancient empire of Persia off the face of the map and once more drove Heraclius and the Romans back behind the mountains of the Taurus and ante-Taurus that defended the Anatolian plateau. From their initial focus on Palestine, and on uniting all Arabs within the embrace of the new faith, the armies of Abu Bakr and Umar had acquired a momentum of their own: they would continue to march on and conquer until either they were defeated or the Day of Judgement came. The Arab armies were clearly aided in their success by the relative exhaustion of the two great superpowers that they had set about dismembering; it was the perspective of the author of the Armenian History, for example, that it was the destructive pride and overweening ambition of Khusro II which had opened the gates of Hell and unleashed the Saracen scourge. In Persia, as we have seen, political circles in Ctesiphon had gone into meltdown as a result of Heraclius’ victorious campaign of 628. Heraclius’ daring descent into Persian territory and his ravaging of the lands to the north of Ctesiphon may well have done lasting damage to the agricultural resources and administration of a region that had been the economic powerhouse of the Sasanian state. Political paralysis and administrative chaos may also have critically limited the ability of the Persian authorities to respond to the Arab threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Heraclius, it should be noted, had gambled everything on his last throw of the dice against Persia. Already drained of their resources by the demands of his war effort, or reduced to ruin by Persian assault, the cities of Asia Minor simply may not have been in a position to finance and support a sustained defence of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, where the restoration of Roman rule in the aftermath of the Persian withdrawal of 628–30 is likely, in any event, to have been largely symbolic at the time when the Arab armies began to appear: long-standing traditions of Roman control had been fractured and disrupted and were yet to be fully restored. Indeed many of the ‘Roman’ armies that the Arabs encountered are likely to have been little more than gendarmes, or local levies, hastily gathered together by civic notables and landowners to defend their cities and estates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it could be argued that the Eastern Roman Empire’s extensive desert frontier was in any case its Achilles heel. The Romans had never successfully resolved the problem of how to police and defend the frontier: walling it off was impossible; maintaining security through the services of conflicting networks of client chiefs had proved untenable; and relying upon the services of a single client chief had been unworkable. At the end of the day, all that had perhaps rendered Roman imperialism practicable and sustainable in Syria and Palestine had been the absence of a concerted threat from along the desert fringe. The Palmyrene revolt of the 270s had demonstrated how fragile Roman control of the region might be if faced with such a challenge. ‘Divide and rule’ thus remained the key to Roman survival. Given the objective military and geographical circumstances, the unity that the religion of Muhammad provided to the tribes of north-central Arabia, and the cultic and military focus towards Roman Palestine that the Prophet ordained, may of itself have been sufficient to seal the fate of Roman power in the East. Constantinople, too, suffered political problems of its own: the death of Heraclius in 641, and the power struggle that ensued, did much to distract attention from the Arab march on Alexandria and to detract from the effective coordination of Roman resistance. Likewise, disaffection on the part of Jewish and other religious minorities, and alienation on the part of the peasantry and the poor, are also likely to have played their role in encouraging communities to come to terms with the invaders in their midst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the triumph of the Arab armies was also the work of the Arabs themselves. The combination of Beduin mobility and the more organised military and political traditions of the sedentary populations of the southern Arabian littoral, such as the Yemenis, created a formidable war machine, whilst the wealth of the Roman and Persian territories provided a clear material incentive for military expansion (especially for tribesmen whose ability to profit from trade with the sedentary empires to the north had perhaps been disrupted by warfare). Tactically, the strategy we see at work in Palestine in 634, of Arab armies attacking ‘soft targets’ such as villages, engaging in conspicuous massacres of the rural population, and then offering terms to the leaders of civic communities, promising security in return for tribute, was a psychologically canny one that permitted strikingly rapid conquests and the avoidance of entanglement in lengthy sieges. When faced with resistance from cities such as Dara, the favoured Arab strategy was simply to storm them, throwing men at the walls until enough of them got in, rather than bedding down to a long drawn-out war of attrition. The brutality shown to the inhabitants of those cities that did resist sent a clear message to the leaders of other communities that it would be in their manifest interest simply to surrender and ‘pay tribute out of hand’, as the Qur’an directed, rather than risk suffering a similar fate. As the Armenian History records of the Arabs, ‘then dread of them fell on the inhabitants of the land, and they all submitted to them’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, however, the ability of the Arab commanders to storm cities—to order their warriors to advance and attack and advance again until a city fell, irrespective of the casualty rate—that perhaps alerts us to the ultimate factor behind Arab success: zeal. Driven on by religious fervour and certain of paradise, the Arab armies appear to have had a far higher ‘pain threshold’ and to have enjoyed morale superior to that of either their Persian or Roman adversaries. Dead or alive, Allah would reward them. Confident in the power of their God, the authority of the Prophet, and the imminence of Divine Judgement, the forces of Islam swept all before them. Both Roman and Persian armies, by contrast, had recently experienced defeat, and, as the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz realised, in warfare it is morale that is often the decisive factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of military campaigns and empires throughout history has often been linked to strong organizational structures and ideological motivation. An example is the rise of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan, whose methods of unification and military discipline paralleled the early Islamic caliphates in their effectiveness and reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organized Power Under Genghis Khan&lt;/strong&gt; Genghis Khan's ability to unify the Mongol tribes into a cohesive force dramatically changed the landscape of the known world. Before his leadership, the Mongol tribes were fragmented, often warring among themselves. Genghis Khan's innovative strategies, along with his ability to inspire loyalty among his followers, laid the foundation for the vast Mongol Empire, mirroring the early Islamic caliphates' success in unifying diverse groups under a common cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Religious Indoctrination in Military Bravery&lt;/strong&gt; An undeniable aspect of historical military success is the role of religious indoctrination in fostering bravery and resilience among fighters. Religious beliefs can instill a sense of purpose and a willingness to sacrifice oneself for a higher cause. This phenomenon can be observed in various historical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the Christian tradition, regular armies often lacked the fervor that religiously devoted groups like the Templars and Hospitallers possessed. These orders, driven by religious zeal, demonstrated remarkable courage and tenacity in battle, owing much to their belief in their spiritual mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the Islamic tradition, the Hashashin were a sect of religiously driven assassins known for their fearlessness and readiness to die for their cause. Their brainwashing and strict adherence to religious ideology contributed to their effectiveness, much like what we see today with groups like ISIS. This kind of religious fervor, however, can lead to significant risks and extreme violence.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Throughout the entire Meccan period spanning 13 years, only a handful of people embraced Islam. Surprisingly, in Medina, a significant number of people converted to Islam even in Muhammad's absence. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the factors, which Muhammad used to spread Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower-status individuals with immature opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissatisfaction with the pagan religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power dynamics and politics (during the initial period of Medina)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coercion through Sword (during the later period of Medina)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) Lower-status People with immature opinions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the pagan Quraysh, only a small number of lower-status individuals believed in Muhammad's message due to their immaturity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamawakened.com/quran/11/27/default.htm&quot;&gt;11.27&lt;/a&gt;: The chiefs of the disbelieving nation said, &quot;We find you to be no more than a human like us, and we find that &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;only those of lower status and immature opinion follow you&lt;/span&gt;. We do not find you superior to us in any way. In fact, we think you are a liar!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the number of such people was very limited, and many of them were slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) Dissatisfaction with the Pagan Religion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagan religions often involved strange rituals that seemed nonsensical to many. In contrast, Muhammad's message of monotheism, focusing on one single god, was appealing to certain individuals. According to Muslim accounts, some pagans had already abandoned their faith to become Christians or followers of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif&quot;&gt;Hanif&lt;/a&gt; religion. However, their numbers remained relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Power dynamics and politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the entire Meccan period spanning 13 years, only a handful of people embraced Islam. Surprisingly, in Medina, a significant number of people converted to Islam even in Muhammad's absence. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in power dynamics and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medina was home to two major pagan Arab tribes, Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj, alongside three major Jewish tribes and several smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan Arabs, feeling inferior to the Jews due to their superior education, wealth, and fertile lands, gradually began to convert to Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2682&quot;&gt;Sunan Abi Dawud, 2682&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the children of a woman (in pre-Islamic days) did not survive, she took a vow on herself that if her child survives, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;she would convert it a Jew&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the pagan Arabs were also afraid of the Jews, as they used to hear from their Jewish neighbours that a prophet would be sent at the end of time and that the Jews would follow him and fight the Arabs along with him and kill them in the same manner in which the earlier nations of ‘Ad and Iram were killed and destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge civil war broke out in Medina, where al-Aws and al-Khazraj fought each other too. And when al-Aws lost a lot of wars against al-Khazraj, they went to seek the alliance of pagan Meccans, but they refused (Samhudi, Wafaa al-Wafaa, Vol. 1, p. 385). At that time Muhammad presented himself to them, seeking protection in Medina and telling them that he and his followers would then assist them. Some of them accepted Islam at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was soon followed by the war of Bu'ath (another civil war in Medinah). It took place 5 years before hijra (i.e. Muhammad's migration to Medina). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Aisha described this war:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3846&quot;&gt;3846&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Allah caused the day of Bu'ath to take place before Allah's Messenger (saw) was sent so that when he reached Medina, those people had already divided (in different groups) and their chiefs had been killed or wounded. So, Allah made that day precede Allah's Messenger (saw) so that they (i.e. the two pagan Arab tribes) might embrace Islam.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of their key leaders (those who had a similar mentality to ibn Ubbay) who could hinder the message of Muhammad were killed as well as large numbers of their followers. Thus, the new generation of two pagan Arab tribes wanted to unite again and utilised the offer of Muhammad. (Samhudi, Wafaa al-Wafaa, Vol. 1, p. 389, Shireef, Tarikh Makah wa al-Madinah, p. 367)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of the Jews to kill and destroy the polytheistic Arabs on the arrival of their next prophet also made al-Aws and al-Khazraj to accept Islam. As al-Aws and al-Khazraj collectively could exert control over the Jews, they received Muhammad and were able to launch the Islamic state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In Zad Al-Ma‘ad, Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/115459/reasons-why-al-aws-and-al-khazraj-tribes-embraced-islam#:~:text=It%20was%20one%20of%20the,would%20follow%20him%20and%20fight&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One of the things which Allah Almighty accomplished for His Messenger, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was that the tribes of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj heard from their allies from among the Jews of Al-Madeenah, that 'A Prophet will appear in our time and we will follow him and kill you, in the same manner in which ‘Ad and Iram were killed.' The Ansar used to perform Hajj, as did the Arabs, but not the Jews. So when they saw the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, inviting people to Allah during the season of Hajj and they observed his manners, some of them said to the others, &quot;&lt;em&gt;You know, by Allah, O people, that this is the prophet whom you were threatened with by the Jews, so do not let them precede you in following him. So hasten to accept his invitation.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(4) Not even 10 Jews believed in Muhammad due to the alleged greatest miracle of inimitability:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving in Medina, initially, Muhammad tried to please the Jews so that they accepted him as a true prophet. For this purpose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad started to copy a lot of Jewish Laws into Islamic Sharia. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also claimed the revelation of such verses, that were pleasing the Jews, like verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/29.46&quot;&gt;29:46&lt;/a&gt; {&lt;em&gt;Our God and your God is one, and to Him we submit&lt;/em&gt;}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also changed the Qibla from Ka'ba to the Jewish Temple (Bait-ul-Muqqadas) in Jerusalem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the Jews of Medina didn't believe in Islam and kept declaring Muhammad to be a false prophet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alleged inimitability and literary miracles of the Quran neither ever impressed the Pagans in Mecca, nor it ever impressed the Jews in Medina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This frustrated Muhammad so much, that he used to say even if 10 Jews believed in him, then all Jews would become Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3941&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 3941&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;arabic_sanad arabic&quot;&gt;عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;arabic_text_details arabic&quot;&gt;&quot;‏ لَوْ آمَنَ بِي &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;عَشَرَةٌ مِنَ الْيَهُودِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; لآمَنَ بِي الْيَهُودُ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;Had &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;only ten Jews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;amongst their chiefs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;believe me, all the Jews would definitely have believed me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2793&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2793&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;arabic_sanad arabic&quot;&gt;عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;arabic_text_details arabic&quot;&gt;&quot;‏ لَوْ تَابَعَنِي &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;عَشْرَةٌ مِنَ الْيَهُودِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; لَمْ يَبْقَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهَا يَهُودِيٌّ إِلاَّ أَسْلَمَ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;If ten &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;scholars of the&lt;/span&gt; Jews would follow me, no Jew would be left upon the surface of the earth who would not embrace Islam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The Islamic Translators of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim added these words in parenthesis on their own &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #fcff01;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(amongst their chiefs)&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #fcff01;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scholars of the Jews&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It is a Distortion (TEHRIF) case, while these words have nothing to do with the original tradition, which is talking about normal 10 Jews, and not about any of their chiefs/scholars. Islamic preachers are compelled to do this TEHRIF (distortion) while it EXPOSES Islam and Muhammad, and Islamic preachers want to HIDE the Truth from the masses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distortion by Islamic preachers is utterly shameful and shows how dishonest they are and how ashamed they are of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems Muhammad repeated this statement multiple times, and his companion 'Auf ibn Malik is also a witness to a similar statement from him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حدثنا أبو المغيرة قال حدثنا صفوان قال حدثنا عبد الرحمن بن جبير بن نفير عن أبيه عن عوف بن مالك قال انطلق النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يوما وأنا معه حتى دخلنا كنيسة اليهود بالمدينة يوم عيد لهم فكرهوا دخولنا عليهم فقال لهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: يا معشر اليهود أروني اثني عشر رجلا يشهدون أنه لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله يحبط الله عن كل يهودي تحت أديم السماء الغضب الذي غضب عليه&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated by Abu Al-Mugheera through Safwan through Abdul-Rahman ibn Jubayr through his father through 'Awf ibn Malik, who said: One day, the Prophet ﷺ and I went to a Jewish synagogue in Medina on one of their festivals. They hated that we made an appearance. The Prophet ﷺ said: &quot;O' Jewish tribe, show me twelve men from among you who testify that there is no deity but Allah,and that Muhammad is his messenger, and Allah will spare all the Jews under the visible heaven from the wrath He has upon them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/hadith/search?q=%D9%8A%D8%A7%20%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%AF%20%D8%A3%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%20%D8%A7%D8%AB%D9%86%D9%8A%20%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B1%20%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A7%20%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%20%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%87%20%D9%84%D8%A7%20%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%87%20%D8%A5%D9%84%D8%A7%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%20%D9%88%D8%A3%D9%86%20%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A7%20%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%84%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%20%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%A8%D8%B7%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%20%D8%B9%D9%86%20%D9%83%D9%84%20%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: Sahih (Albani)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Jews of Medina still refused to accept him as a true prophet, and that was the point where Muhammad's enmity and hatred started against the Jews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all, Muhammad changed the Qibla once again from Bait-ul-Muqqadas to Ka'ba in Mecca. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then he started openly threatening the Jews to accept Islam, otherwise, they would be expelled from Medina, and he would snatch away all of their lands by force. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3167&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 3167&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;While we were in the Mosque, the Prophet (ﷺ) came out and said, &quot;Let us go to the Jews&quot; We went out till we reached Bait-ul-Midras. He said to them,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0007ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &quot;If you embrace Islam, you will be safe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You should know &lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;that the earth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;belongs to Allah and His Apostle (only)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #007008;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;and I want to expel you from this land.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if anyone amongst you owns some property, he is permitted to sell it, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #007008;&quot;&gt;otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that was the whole argument of Muhammad: &quot;...&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle (only)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Please remember that Muhammad used the same argument to attack innocent Pagan tribes (who had nothing to do with Muhammad previously and had never attacked or harmed Muhammad). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3012:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Narrated As-Sab bin Jaththama: The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me at a place called Al-Abwa or Waddan, and was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, &quot;They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans).&quot; Prophet said: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the graze-lands belong to Allah and his prophet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Muhammad's anger and hatred against the Jews went so high that he was no more satisfied by expelling them from Medina, but he wanted to expel them from the whole Arab peninsula. It was due to the reason that it was a shame for him that he was claiming himself to be the promised prophet of the Jews, but the Jews were telling people that he was not that promised prophet. Muhammad didn't want the Jews to tell this to others, thus he wanted to expel them from the whole Arabian peninsula. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/32/75&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 1767(a)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been narrated by 'Umar b. al-Khattib that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and will not leave any but Muslim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(5) Pagans didn't accept Islam even after the Victory of Mecca:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the conquest of Mecca by Muhammad in the 7th year of Hijri, the pagan Meccans remained resistant to accepting Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to prevent opposition from the pagan leaders of Mecca, Muhammad offered stipends to them, fostering a sense of financial interest and aiming to ensure their compliance with Islam. Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.60&quot;&gt;9:60&lt;/a&gt;). But despite getting the stipends, they didn't accept Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(6) Pagans accepted Islam only after they were FORCED to do it under the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Fear of Sword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the situation was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native Arabic-speaking Pagans of Mecca were not accepting Islam due to its challenge of inimitability or any linguistic miracle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn't accept it after the conquer of Mecca in 7th Hijri year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They didn't accept it even after receiving stipends. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 9th Hijri year, Muhammad claimed the revelation of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.5&quot;&gt;9:5&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. the Verse of the Sword, which ordered to kill all polytheists after 4 months). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.5&quot;&gt;9:5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the sacred months have passed, then &lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kill the polytheists wherever you find them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;establish&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; prayer, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and give&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; zakah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;i.e. if they become Muslims&lt;/em&gt;), let them [go] on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad allowed the people of the book (i.e. Christians/Jews/Magians) to stay alive by paying Jizya tax, but he refused to accept any Jizya from polytheists. They either had to accept Islam, or they would be slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after that, pagan Arabs accepted Islam to save their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christians/Jews/Magians paid Jizya but didn't accept Islam. It was difficult for Muhammad to kill Christians and Jews as killing them for not accepting Islam would have angered the Christian Byzantine Empire while killing Magians would have angered the Magian Persian Empire. But pagan Arabs were vulnerable and they had no backing outside of Arabia. Therefore, Muhammad allowed them to stay alive by paying Jizya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to this forced conversion, we do see Christians and Jews in Arab countries, but no polytheists as all of them were forced to convert to Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(7) Reasons for Arab Success over &lt;span id=&quot;The_Romans_(Byzantines)_have_been_defeated_in_the_nearest_land_-_Quran_30:2-7&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Byzantines &lt;/span&gt;and Persians&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many books on this subject. For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empires of Faith: The Fall of Rome to the Rise of Islam - Peter Sarris - Oxford University Press (2011)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an excerpt of the latter on Page 272&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons For Arab Success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What had begun as an attempt on the part of Muhammad’s followers to claim and occupy what they regarded as their divinely promised patrimony in Palestine had therefore escalated into an extraordinary wave of conquests; these wiped the ancient empire of Persia off the face of the map and once more drove Heraclius and the Romans back behind the mountains of the Taurus and ante-Taurus that defended the Anatolian plateau. From their initial focus on Palestine, and on uniting all Arabs within the embrace of the new faith, the armies of Abu Bakr and Umar had acquired a momentum of their own: they would continue to march on and conquer until either they were defeated or the Day of Judgement came. The Arab armies were clearly aided in their success by the relative exhaustion of the two great superpowers that they had set about dismembering; it was the perspective of the author of the Armenian History, for example, that it was the destructive pride and overweening ambition of Khusro II which had opened the gates of Hell and unleashed the Saracen scourge. In Persia, as we have seen, political circles in Ctesiphon had gone into meltdown as a result of Heraclius’ victorious campaign of 628. Heraclius’ daring descent into Persian territory and his ravaging of the lands to the north of Ctesiphon may well have done lasting damage to the agricultural resources and administration of a region that had been the economic powerhouse of the Sasanian state. Political paralysis and administrative chaos may also have critically limited the ability of the Persian authorities to respond to the Arab threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Heraclius, it should be noted, had gambled everything on his last throw of the dice against Persia. Already drained of their resources by the demands of his war effort, or reduced to ruin by Persian assault, the cities of Asia Minor simply may not have been in a position to finance and support a sustained defence of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, where the restoration of Roman rule in the aftermath of the Persian withdrawal of 628–30 is likely, in any event, to have been largely symbolic at the time when the Arab armies began to appear: long-standing traditions of Roman control had been fractured and disrupted and were yet to be fully restored. Indeed many of the ‘Roman’ armies that the Arabs encountered are likely to have been little more than gendarmes, or local levies, hastily gathered together by civic notables and landowners to defend their cities and estates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it could be argued that the Eastern Roman Empire’s extensive desert frontier was in any case its Achilles heel. The Romans had never successfully resolved the problem of how to police and defend the frontier: walling it off was impossible; maintaining security through the services of conflicting networks of client chiefs had proved untenable; and relying upon the services of a single client chief had been unworkable. At the end of the day, all that had perhaps rendered Roman imperialism practicable and sustainable in Syria and Palestine had been the absence of a concerted threat from along the desert fringe. The Palmyrene revolt of the 270s had demonstrated how fragile Roman control of the region might be if faced with such a challenge. ‘Divide and rule’ thus remained the key to Roman survival. Given the objective military and geographical circumstances, the unity that the religion of Muhammad provided to the tribes of north-central Arabia, and the cultic and military focus towards Roman Palestine that the Prophet ordained, may of itself have been sufficient to seal the fate of Roman power in the East. Constantinople, too, suffered political problems of its own: the death of Heraclius in 641, and the power struggle that ensued, did much to distract attention from the Arab march on Alexandria and to detract from the effective coordination of Roman resistance. Likewise, disaffection on the part of Jewish and other religious minorities, and alienation on the part of the peasantry and the poor, are also likely to have played their role in encouraging communities to come to terms with the invaders in their midst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the triumph of the Arab armies was also the work of the Arabs themselves. The combination of Beduin mobility and the more organised military and political traditions of the sedentary populations of the southern Arabian littoral, such as the Yemenis, created a formidable war machine, whilst the wealth of the Roman and Persian territories provided a clear material incentive for military expansion (especially for tribesmen whose ability to profit from trade with the sedentary empires to the north had perhaps been disrupted by warfare). Tactically, the strategy we see at work in Palestine in 634, of Arab armies attacking ‘soft targets’ such as villages, engaging in conspicuous massacres of the rural population, and then offering terms to the leaders of civic communities, promising security in return for tribute, was a psychologically canny one that permitted strikingly rapid conquests and the avoidance of entanglement in lengthy sieges. When faced with resistance from cities such as Dara, the favoured Arab strategy was simply to storm them, throwing men at the walls until enough of them got in, rather than bedding down to a long drawn-out war of attrition. The brutality shown to the inhabitants of those cities that did resist sent a clear message to the leaders of other communities that it would be in their manifest interest simply to surrender and ‘pay tribute out of hand’, as the Qur’an directed, rather than risk suffering a similar fate. As the Armenian History records of the Arabs, ‘then dread of them fell on the inhabitants of the land, and they all submitted to them’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, however, the ability of the Arab commanders to storm cities—to order their warriors to advance and attack and advance again until a city fell, irrespective of the casualty rate—that perhaps alerts us to the ultimate factor behind Arab success: zeal. Driven on by religious fervour and certain of paradise, the Arab armies appear to have had a far higher ‘pain threshold’ and to have enjoyed morale superior to that of either their Persian or Roman adversaries. Dead or alive, Allah would reward them. Confident in the power of their God, the authority of the Prophet, and the imminence of Divine Judgement, the forces of Islam swept all before them. Both Roman and Persian armies, by contrast, had recently experienced defeat, and, as the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz realised, in warfare it is morale that is often the decisive factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of military campaigns and empires throughout history has often been linked to strong organizational structures and ideological motivation. An example is the rise of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan, whose methods of unification and military discipline paralleled the early Islamic caliphates in their effectiveness and reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organized Power Under Genghis Khan&lt;/strong&gt; Genghis Khan's ability to unify the Mongol tribes into a cohesive force dramatically changed the landscape of the known world. Before his leadership, the Mongol tribes were fragmented, often warring among themselves. Genghis Khan's innovative strategies, along with his ability to inspire loyalty among his followers, laid the foundation for the vast Mongol Empire, mirroring the early Islamic caliphates' success in unifying diverse groups under a common cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Religious Indoctrination in Military Bravery&lt;/strong&gt; An undeniable aspect of historical military success is the role of religious indoctrination in fostering bravery and resilience among fighters. Religious beliefs can instill a sense of purpose and a willingness to sacrifice oneself for a higher cause. This phenomenon can be observed in various historical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the Christian tradition, regular armies often lacked the fervor that religiously devoted groups like the Templars and Hospitallers possessed. These orders, driven by religious zeal, demonstrated remarkable courage and tenacity in battle, owing much to their belief in their spiritual mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the Islamic tradition, the Hashashin were a sect of religiously driven assassins known for their fearlessness and readiness to die for their cause. Their brainwashing and strict adherence to religious ideology contributed to their effectiveness, much like what we see today with groups like ISIS. This kind of religious fervor, however, can lead to significant risks and extreme violence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Bible claimed that Saul, David, and Solomon ruled a grand empire. Although, the Bible's stories are fascinating and comforting but lack historical accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad went one step further in telling fantastical stories, and he made claims in the Quran that Solomon had &quot;supernatural&quot; powers, through which he controlled jinns, who then made high arches and palaces for Solomon. [Note: The Bible neither claimed any supernatural powers for Solomon nor any control upon jinns made high places]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/34/13/default.htm&quot;&gt;34:12-13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;... یَعۡمَلُونَ لَهُۥ مَا یَشَاۤءُ مِن &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;مَّحَـٰرِیبَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَتَمَـٰثِیلَ وَجِفَانࣲ كَٱلۡجَوَابِ وَقُدُورࣲ رَّاسِیَـٰتٍۚ ٱعۡمَلُوۤا۟ ءَالَ دَاوُۥدَ شُكۡرࣰاۚ وَقَلِیلࣱ مِّنۡ عِبَادِیَ ٱلشَّكُورُ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And We &lt;strong&gt;subdued the wind to Solomon&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;its morning course was a month's journey and its evening course was a month's journey&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;We gave him a spring flowing with molten brass&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;We subdued for him jinn&lt;/strong&gt; who, by his Lord's permission, worked before him ... &lt;strong&gt;They made for him whatever he desired:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; high ARCHES and (grand) STATUES, basins like reservoirs, and large cooking vessels fixed in their places&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Quran, the Queen of Sheba was brought to one such great palace which had a glass floor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.44&quot;&gt;27:44&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She was told: &quot;Enter the &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;palace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot; But when she saw it, she thought it was a pool of water and she bared both her calves (to enter into it). Solomon said: &quot;This is a slippery &lt;strong&gt;floor of glass&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; Thereupon she cried out: &quot;My Lord, I have been inflicting much wrong on myself. Now I submit myself with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the whole Universe.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern science found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No archaeological proofs of any high arches or palaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No archaeological proofs of any springs of molten brass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No archaeological proofs of any grand statues, basins like reservoirs or large cooking vessels etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No archaeological evidence supports the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_L._Thompson&quot;&gt;Professor Thomas Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world's leading archaeologists and an authority on biblical archaeology, authored a book titled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Early-History-Israelite-People-Archaeological/dp/9004094830&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;productTitle&quot; class=&quot;a-size-extra-large celwidget&quot; data-csa-c-id=&quot;8p9r3d-xircii-hvj3xt-ifuolo&quot; data-cel-widget=&quot;productTitle&quot;&gt;Early History of the Israelite People&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; after fifteen years of research. In it, he claims that significant biblical figures like Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David, Solomon, and many others did not exist in reality but were mythical characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Professor Thompson, there is no doubt that the first ten books of the Bible are myths. These books or myths were written during a time when the supposed events had occurred 500 to 1,500 years earlier. Furthermore, the Bible's events are not corroborated by history, archaeology, anthropology, or sociology. Therefore, we can confidently say today that the Israelites were never enslaved by the Egyptians, nor did they exodus from Egypt. Likewise, the forty-year desert wandering, the conquest of Canaan or the Promised Land, and the construction of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excavations around Jerusalem and Judea show no signs of habitation from the 10th century BCE, the time when the Bible claims the kingdoms of David and Solomon were at their peak. How could a great kingdom exist without a population? Jerusalem became a large and significant city only around 650 years before Jesus Christ's arrival. Therefore, it is impossible that Saul, David, and Solomon ruled a grand empire from a small village. The Bible's stories are fascinating and comforting but lack historical accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Thompson states that the biblical narratives were written in the 5th century BCE when Jerusalem and its surroundings were part of the Persian Empire. The creation of the Israeli nation is credited to the Persians. It should be noted that Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed Jerusalem and exiled not only Jews but also Palestinians, Syrians, and Phoenicians to Babylon. The Persians resettled their descendants in Jerusalem around 450 BCE and also built a temple for the Jewish God Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the first temple dedicated to Yahweh in Jerusalem was built about 500 years after the biblical timeline. Before this, the temple of Yahweh was in Samaria. The Persians aimed to diminish Samaria's influence by developing Jerusalem. Additionally, constructing temples for local gods was part of Persia's political strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish and Christian religious leaders have had mixed reactions to Professor Thompson's book. Most rabbis state that the Bible is not a history book but was written to establish a relationship between God and humans. Therefore, one should seek wisdom in the Bible rather than history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Julian Jacob claims that the Bible is a holy divine scripture and its truth does not require historical evidence. Some Christian priests have considered this book an attack on the credibility of the holy scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/Bible-Unearthed-Archaeologys-Vision-Ancient/dp/0684869136&quot;&gt;The Bible Unearthed&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Tel Aviv University &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Finkelstein&quot;&gt;Professor Israel Finkelstein&lt;/a&gt; and archaeologist and historian Neil Asher Silberman of Archaeology Magazine support Professor Thompson's stance on the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the conquest of Canaan, the kingdom of David and Solomon, and the construction of Solomon's Temple. They also admit that it is impossible to validate the biblical narratives through archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They write that although excavations around Jerusalem and its vicinity have identified many towns and cities mentioned in the Bible, this does not mean the biblical historical events are true. It has now been proven that these events did not occur as the Bible describes them, nor at the times stated. The truth is that many of the key events in the Bible never actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, comparing archaeological discoveries from Israel, the Near East, and around the world with the history of the Israelites clearly shows that the Bible is a magnificent mythical literary masterpiece of religious clergy, but it lacks any real historical foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dunning_(author)&quot;&gt;Brian Dunning&lt;/a&gt;, in his blog &quot;Did Jewish Slaves Build the Pyramids of Egypt?&quot; also regards the biblical events as myths. He writes that the Bible's story of Jewish slaves building the pyramids of Egypt is very popular. Hollywood has even made classic films on this subject, but historical and archaeological evidence does not support the Bible's account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pyramids were built, there were no Jews in Egypt. Furthermore, in 1990, excavations near the pyramids discovered the tombs and detailed records of the workers who built these pyramids. These workers were Egyptian farmers. Most of them worked on pyramid construction during the periods when the Nile River floods destroyed their lands. They were paid reasonable wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, their food, accommodation, and medical care were well-organized. Daily, 21 cattle and 23 sheep were slaughtered to feed them. Sick workers continued to receive wages, and deceased workers were buried with full honors. Thus, given these historical and archaeological evidences, the question of Jewish slaves building the pyramids does not arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Archaeological Evidence available that Solomon Built Any Mosque&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation surrounding al-Haram al-Sharif (which consists of the &lt;strong&gt;Dome of the Rock&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Masjid al-Aqsa)&lt;/strong&gt; is particularly intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Jews claim that al-Haram al-Sharif was built over the ruins of Solomon's Temple and its compound. However, archaeologists found absolutely no traces of any ruins under it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple#CITEREFFinkelsteinSilberman2002&quot;&gt;Finkelstein &amp;amp; Silberman 2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, p. 128:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Moreover, for all their reported wealth and power, neither David nor Solomon is mentioned in a single known Egyptian or Mesopotamian text. And the archaeological evidence in Jerusalem for the famous building projects of Solomon is nonexistent ... Nineteenth and early-twentieth century excavations around the Temple Mount did not identify 'even a trace' of the complex.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple#CITEREFLundquist2008&quot;&gt;Lundquist 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, p. 45:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The single most important fact regarding the Temple of Solomon is that there are no physical remains of the structure. There is not a single object or artifact that can be indubitably connected with the Temple of Solomon.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muslims become very happy upon this archaeological finding and boast that present day Israelites (Jews) have no right on al-Haram al-Sharif. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this issue becomes even more intriguing when considering that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(230, 126, 35);&quot;&gt;if Muslims deny any evidence of the Jewish Solomon's Temple and its compound beneath the present al-Haram al-Sharif, it also implies that their prophet Solomon did not build a &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;MOSQUE&lt;/span&gt; there either&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 128, 0);&quot;&gt;Whether referred to as a temple or a mosque, no archaeological proof exists for either structure beneath al-Haram al-Sharif&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Muslims deny the presence of any Jewish Solomon's Temple beneath al-Haram al-Sharif. On the other hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muslims believe that the current Dome of the Rock stands on the site where Solomon built a mosque during his era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And they also believe that the current Dome of the Rock was the place where their prophet Muhammad prayed during his ascension journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic Fatwa website Q&amp;amp;A gives this brief history (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/224401/al-masjid-al-aqsa-is-not-the-temple-and-was-not-built-on-its-ruins&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What appears to be the case is that when Ibrahim passed through the land of al-Sham (Greater Syria, including Palestine) and Allah promised him that his progeny would inherit this land, Allah showed him the place where the &lt;strong&gt;biggest masjid&lt;/strong&gt; that his progeny would build would be. So he built a small masjid there, in gratitude to Allah, may He be exalted, and he built it on the rock that was allocated for the purpose of offering sacrifices. &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the rock on which Sulayman built the masjid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But as the people of that time were polytheists, that structure was neglected and disappeared, &lt;strong&gt;until Allah guided Sulayman to build al-Masjid al-Aqsa on it&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;(A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;l-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;  4/15).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is further supported by the fact that after Muhammad's death, when the second Caliph Umar Ibn Khattab conquered Jerusalem and Muslims entered the city for the first time, they were uncertain about the exact location where their prophet Muhammad had prayed. Umar took it upon himself to identify the spot where the Jewish Temple had once stood — its location and destruction were well-known throughout the region, and the Byzantine Christian rulers of the Levant before the Islamic conquest had been using the Temple Mount as a &lt;strong&gt;garbage dump&lt;/strong&gt;. Umar ordered the construction of two major structures: the Dome of the Rock (where Muhammad prayed) and Masjid al-Aqsa. In modern Arabic usage, Masjid al-Aqsa can refer either to (A) the mosque that Umar built at the southern end of the Temple Mount compound or (B) the entire Temple Mount compound itself, which is referred to in Arabic as Haram as-Sharif, “the Noble Sanctuary.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, Umar did not receive any direct 'revelation' about the exact location of the mosque built by Solomon (where Muhammad prayed). Instead, he consulted the locals, who identified the site where the Jews believed Solomon's Temple once stood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, logically speaking: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Either the present Dome of the Rock is standing upon Solomon's Temple, or it is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not sacred&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;, as Umar constructed it based on an incorrect location identified by the Jews. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why was Solomon building STATUES, when they are HARAM (forbidden) to build?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Islamic doctrine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All prophets were Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And all prophets refrained from committing any major sins, especially shirk (شرک), which is the act of worshipping any deity other than Allah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And building statues is strictly forbidden (haram) in Islam as it is considered a form of shirk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the Quranic story of Solomon, it is mentioned that Solomon commanded the jinn to create statues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/34/13/default.htm&quot;&gt;34:13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;... یَعۡمَلُونَ لَهُۥ مَا یَشَاۤءُ مِن &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;مَّحَـٰرِیبَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَتَمَـٰثِیلَ وَجِفَانࣲ كَٱلۡجَوَابِ وَقُدُورࣲ رَّاسِیَـٰتٍۚ ٱعۡمَلُوۤا۟ ءَالَ دَاوُۥدَ شُكۡرࣰاۚ وَقَلِیلࣱ مِّنۡ عِبَادِیَ ٱلشَّكُورُ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They (the Jinns) made for him (Solomon) whatever he desired:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt;high ARCHES&lt;/span&gt; and (grand) STATUES,&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;basins like reservoirs, and large cooking vessels fixed in their places&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, one wonders, why was Solomon building STATUES when they were forbidden to be made? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then we understand it when we read the following story in the Bible (&lt;strong&gt;1 Kings 11:7-8:). &lt;/strong&gt;These verses describe Solomon's turning away from God (i.e. indulging in SHIRK) and building high places (arches) for other gods, influenced by his foreign wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2011&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;1 Kings 11&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-1&quot;&gt;King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;besides Pharaoh’s daughter—Moabites, Ammonites,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9111&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;They were from nations about which the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.” Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9112&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and his wives led him astray.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9113&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and his heart was not fully devoted&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;his God, as the heart of David his father had been.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9114&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-5&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;5 &lt;/sup&gt;He followed Ashtoreth&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molek&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the detestable god of the Ammonites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9115&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-6&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;6 &lt;/sup&gt;So Solomon did evil&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in the eyes of the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; he did not follow the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;completely, as David his father had done. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9116&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-7&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;7 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;high place (arch)&lt;/span&gt; for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9117&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-8&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;8 &lt;/sup&gt;He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the stories about Solomon that reached Muhammad, he was depicted as constructing towering buildings and statues of deities. Muhammad incorporated these narratives into the Quran. However, as a human, Muhammad overlooked the fact that he had previously declared the building of statues as Haram (forbidden) and a part of the unforgivable sin of SHIRK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible vs. Quran: Did Solomon Possess Supernatural Powers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran attributes several supernatural powers to Solomon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control over the Wind:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 34:12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control over the Jinn:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 34:12-13&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding of Animal Speech:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 27:16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Army Comprising of Jinn, Humans, and Birds:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 27:17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summoning the Queen of Sheba's Throne:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 27:38-40&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to Melt Copper:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 34:12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Bible does not ascribe any supernatural powers to Solomon, depicting him instead as an ordinary human. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction of Solomon's Temple:&lt;/strong&gt; The Bible describes Solomon using human labor to build his temple, not jinns (1 Kings 6:14-38).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Queen of Sheba's visit, the Quran presents a supernatural account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.38?context=5&quot;&gt;27:38-40&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon asks his assembly of jinn who can bring the Queen's throne to him before she arrives. A powerful jinn responds, but one with knowledge from the Scripture brings it within the twinkling of an eye. Solomon then acknowledges this as a test from his Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Bible describes a physical journey by the Queen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Chronicles 9:1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame and traveled to Jerusalem with a grand caravan to test his wisdom, bringing spices, gold, and precious stones. She engaged Solomon in conversation about everything on her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is another ancient text called the &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testament of Solomon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; which was not included in the Bible but gained notoriety for its fantastical accounts of Solomon's supernatural abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key points from the &quot;Testament of Solomon&quot; include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solomon's Seal:&lt;/strong&gt; The text describes Solomon receiving a magical ring from the archangel Michael, granting him the power to command demons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the Temple:&lt;/strong&gt; Solomon uses the ring to subjugate demons, forcing them to assist in the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interrogation and Binding of Demons:&lt;/strong&gt; The text details Solomon interrogating various demons, discovering their activities and methods for countering them, binding them, and making them work under his command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad was an illiterate. He did hear stories of the Bible, but that didn't make him a 'Scholar' of the Bible. Therefore, he was unable to differentiate between the genuine Biblical accounts of Solomon and the other fantastical stories associated with Solomon. Consequently, Muhammad included these supernatural tales in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There are no JINNS present in the Bible, but this concept has pre-islamic pagan roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jinns in Islam has its roots in pre-Islamic pagan beliefs and is not found in the Bible. In the Bible, the only supernatural beings are fallen angels or demons, which are distinctly different from Jinns in several key ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Origin and Creation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jinns&lt;/strong&gt;: In Islamic tradition, Jinns are created from &quot;smokeless fire,&quot; a concept not present in any biblical scripture. Muhammad introduced this idea, which aligns with pre-Islamic Arabian beliefs where Jinns were considered supernatural entities that could interact with humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bible speaks of &lt;strong&gt;fallen angels&lt;/strong&gt; (like Lucifer and his followers), but they are created as angels, spiritual beings, and are not linked to fire. These angels rebelled against God and became the devils or demons. There is no mention in the Bible of entities created from fire or with the specific attributes of Jinns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Structure&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jinns&lt;/strong&gt;: In Islam, Jinns have their own social structure, with the ability to marry, bear children, and have families. This is not a feature of fallen angels or devils in Christianity, which are generally seen as singular beings, not engaging in human-like familial relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible&lt;/strong&gt;: Fallen angels in Christian scripture do not have families. The idea of angels mating with humans is rejected in biblical texts, though some apocryphal texts (like the Book of Enoch) mention angels interbreeding with humans, but this is not a mainstream biblical teaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion and Conversion&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jinns&lt;/strong&gt;: Islam holds that Jinns can convert to Islam or any other religion and be guided by prophets. This idea reflects a deeper spiritual interaction between humans and Jinns, showing a level of submission to religious guidance similar to humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bible does not suggest that fallen angels or demons can &quot;convert&quot; to Christianity. They are seen as eternally fallen, with no hope for redemption. The concept of spiritual beings changing faiths is absent from biblical doctrine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function in Worldly Affairs&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jinns&lt;/strong&gt;: In Islamic tradition, Jinns are sometimes seen as beings who can be controlled and made to serve human interests, such as constructing palaces or performing other tasks. This reflects the magical and supernatural role that Jinns played in Arabian folklore and pre-Islamic religions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no biblical concept of fallen angels or devils being used in worldly affairs, such as building structures or performing tasks for humans. Demons are portrayed as harmful and rebellious, influencing humans to sin but not serving human interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept of Jinns in Islam is borrowed from pre-Islamic, pagan beliefs and has no parallel in the Bible. The Bible discusses fallen angels or demons, but these are entirely different entities, with distinct characteristics and roles. The parallels between Jinns and pre-Islamic deities or spirits suggest that Muhammad adapted this concept to Islam, mirroring the beliefs of the cultures he encountered rather than introducing a wholly unique idea. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Bible claimed that Saul, David, and Solomon ruled a grand empire. Although, the Bible's stories are fascinating and comforting but lack historical accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad went one step further in telling fantastical stories, and he made claims in the Quran that Solomon had &quot;supernatural&quot; powers, through which he controlled jinns, who then made high arches and palaces for Solomon. [Note: The Bible neither claimed any supernatural powers for Solomon nor any control upon jinns made high places]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/34/13/default.htm&quot;&gt;34:12-13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;... یَعۡمَلُونَ لَهُۥ مَا یَشَاۤءُ مِن &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;مَّحَـٰرِیبَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَتَمَـٰثِیلَ وَجِفَانࣲ كَٱلۡجَوَابِ وَقُدُورࣲ رَّاسِیَـٰتٍۚ ٱعۡمَلُوۤا۟ ءَالَ دَاوُۥدَ شُكۡرࣰاۚ وَقَلِیلࣱ مِّنۡ عِبَادِیَ ٱلشَّكُورُ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And We &lt;strong&gt;subdued the wind to Solomon&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;its morning course was a month's journey and its evening course was a month's journey&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;We gave him a spring flowing with molten brass&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;We subdued for him jinn&lt;/strong&gt; who, by his Lord's permission, worked before him ... &lt;strong&gt;They made for him whatever he desired:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; high ARCHES and (grand) STATUES, basins like reservoirs, and large cooking vessels fixed in their places&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Quran, the Queen of Sheba was brought to one such great palace which had a glass floor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.44&quot;&gt;27:44&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She was told: &quot;Enter the &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;palace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot; But when she saw it, she thought it was a pool of water and she bared both her calves (to enter into it). Solomon said: &quot;This is a slippery &lt;strong&gt;floor of glass&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; Thereupon she cried out: &quot;My Lord, I have been inflicting much wrong on myself. Now I submit myself with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the whole Universe.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern science found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No archaeological proofs of any high arches or palaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No archaeological proofs of any springs of molten brass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No archaeological proofs of any grand statues, basins like reservoirs or large cooking vessels etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No archaeological evidence supports the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_L._Thompson&quot;&gt;Professor Thomas Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world's leading archaeologists and an authority on biblical archaeology, authored a book titled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Early-History-Israelite-People-Archaeological/dp/9004094830&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;productTitle&quot; class=&quot;a-size-extra-large celwidget&quot; data-csa-c-id=&quot;8p9r3d-xircii-hvj3xt-ifuolo&quot; data-cel-widget=&quot;productTitle&quot;&gt;Early History of the Israelite People&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; after fifteen years of research. In it, he claims that significant biblical figures like Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David, Solomon, and many others did not exist in reality but were mythical characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Professor Thompson, there is no doubt that the first ten books of the Bible are myths. These books or myths were written during a time when the supposed events had occurred 500 to 1,500 years earlier. Furthermore, the Bible's events are not corroborated by history, archaeology, anthropology, or sociology. Therefore, we can confidently say today that the Israelites were never enslaved by the Egyptians, nor did they exodus from Egypt. Likewise, the forty-year desert wandering, the conquest of Canaan or the Promised Land, and the construction of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excavations around Jerusalem and Judea show no signs of habitation from the 10th century BCE, the time when the Bible claims the kingdoms of David and Solomon were at their peak. How could a great kingdom exist without a population? Jerusalem became a large and significant city only around 650 years before Jesus Christ's arrival. Therefore, it is impossible that Saul, David, and Solomon ruled a grand empire from a small village. The Bible's stories are fascinating and comforting but lack historical accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Thompson states that the biblical narratives were written in the 5th century BCE when Jerusalem and its surroundings were part of the Persian Empire. The creation of the Israeli nation is credited to the Persians. It should be noted that Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed Jerusalem and exiled not only Jews but also Palestinians, Syrians, and Phoenicians to Babylon. The Persians resettled their descendants in Jerusalem around 450 BCE and also built a temple for the Jewish God Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the first temple dedicated to Yahweh in Jerusalem was built about 500 years after the biblical timeline. Before this, the temple of Yahweh was in Samaria. The Persians aimed to diminish Samaria's influence by developing Jerusalem. Additionally, constructing temples for local gods was part of Persia's political strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish and Christian religious leaders have had mixed reactions to Professor Thompson's book. Most rabbis state that the Bible is not a history book but was written to establish a relationship between God and humans. Therefore, one should seek wisdom in the Bible rather than history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Julian Jacob claims that the Bible is a holy divine scripture and its truth does not require historical evidence. Some Christian priests have considered this book an attack on the credibility of the holy scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/Bible-Unearthed-Archaeologys-Vision-Ancient/dp/0684869136&quot;&gt;The Bible Unearthed&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Tel Aviv University &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Finkelstein&quot;&gt;Professor Israel Finkelstein&lt;/a&gt; and archaeologist and historian Neil Asher Silberman of Archaeology Magazine support Professor Thompson's stance on the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the conquest of Canaan, the kingdom of David and Solomon, and the construction of Solomon's Temple. They also admit that it is impossible to validate the biblical narratives through archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They write that although excavations around Jerusalem and its vicinity have identified many towns and cities mentioned in the Bible, this does not mean the biblical historical events are true. It has now been proven that these events did not occur as the Bible describes them, nor at the times stated. The truth is that many of the key events in the Bible never actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, comparing archaeological discoveries from Israel, the Near East, and around the world with the history of the Israelites clearly shows that the Bible is a magnificent mythical literary masterpiece of religious clergy, but it lacks any real historical foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dunning_(author)&quot;&gt;Brian Dunning&lt;/a&gt;, in his blog &quot;Did Jewish Slaves Build the Pyramids of Egypt?&quot; also regards the biblical events as myths. He writes that the Bible's story of Jewish slaves building the pyramids of Egypt is very popular. Hollywood has even made classic films on this subject, but historical and archaeological evidence does not support the Bible's account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pyramids were built, there were no Jews in Egypt. Furthermore, in 1990, excavations near the pyramids discovered the tombs and detailed records of the workers who built these pyramids. These workers were Egyptian farmers. Most of them worked on pyramid construction during the periods when the Nile River floods destroyed their lands. They were paid reasonable wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, their food, accommodation, and medical care were well-organized. Daily, 21 cattle and 23 sheep were slaughtered to feed them. Sick workers continued to receive wages, and deceased workers were buried with full honors. Thus, given these historical and archaeological evidences, the question of Jewish slaves building the pyramids does not arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Archaeological Evidence available that Solomon Built Any Mosque&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation surrounding al-Haram al-Sharif (which consists of the &lt;strong&gt;Dome of the Rock&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Masjid al-Aqsa)&lt;/strong&gt; is particularly intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Jews claim that al-Haram al-Sharif was built over the ruins of Solomon's Temple and its compound. However, archaeologists found absolutely no traces of any ruins under it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple#CITEREFFinkelsteinSilberman2002&quot;&gt;Finkelstein &amp;amp; Silberman 2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, p. 128:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Moreover, for all their reported wealth and power, neither David nor Solomon is mentioned in a single known Egyptian or Mesopotamian text. And the archaeological evidence in Jerusalem for the famous building projects of Solomon is nonexistent ... Nineteenth and early-twentieth century excavations around the Temple Mount did not identify 'even a trace' of the complex.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple#CITEREFLundquist2008&quot;&gt;Lundquist 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, p. 45:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The single most important fact regarding the Temple of Solomon is that there are no physical remains of the structure. There is not a single object or artifact that can be indubitably connected with the Temple of Solomon.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muslims become very happy upon this archaeological finding and boast that present day Israelites (Jews) have no right on al-Haram al-Sharif. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this issue becomes even more intriguing when considering that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(230, 126, 35);&quot;&gt;if Muslims deny any evidence of the Jewish Solomon's Temple and its compound beneath the present al-Haram al-Sharif, it also implies that their prophet Solomon did not build a &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;MOSQUE&lt;/span&gt; there either&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 128, 0);&quot;&gt;Whether referred to as a temple or a mosque, no archaeological proof exists for either structure beneath al-Haram al-Sharif&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Muslims deny the presence of any Jewish Solomon's Temple beneath al-Haram al-Sharif. On the other hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muslims believe that the current Dome of the Rock stands on the site where Solomon built a mosque during his era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And they also believe that the current Dome of the Rock was the place where their prophet Muhammad prayed during his ascension journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic Fatwa website Q&amp;amp;A gives this brief history (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/224401/al-masjid-al-aqsa-is-not-the-temple-and-was-not-built-on-its-ruins&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What appears to be the case is that when Ibrahim passed through the land of al-Sham (Greater Syria, including Palestine) and Allah promised him that his progeny would inherit this land, Allah showed him the place where the &lt;strong&gt;biggest masjid&lt;/strong&gt; that his progeny would build would be. So he built a small masjid there, in gratitude to Allah, may He be exalted, and he built it on the rock that was allocated for the purpose of offering sacrifices. &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the rock on which Sulayman built the masjid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But as the people of that time were polytheists, that structure was neglected and disappeared, &lt;strong&gt;until Allah guided Sulayman to build al-Masjid al-Aqsa on it&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;(A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;l-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;  4/15).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is further supported by the fact that after Muhammad's death, when the second Caliph Umar Ibn Khattab conquered Jerusalem and Muslims entered the city for the first time, they were uncertain about the exact location where their prophet Muhammad had prayed. Umar took it upon himself to identify the spot where the Jewish Temple had once stood — its location and destruction were well-known throughout the region, and the Byzantine Christian rulers of the Levant before the Islamic conquest had been using the Temple Mount as a &lt;strong&gt;garbage dump&lt;/strong&gt;. Umar ordered the construction of two major structures: the Dome of the Rock (where Muhammad prayed) and Masjid al-Aqsa. In modern Arabic usage, Masjid al-Aqsa can refer either to (A) the mosque that Umar built at the southern end of the Temple Mount compound or (B) the entire Temple Mount compound itself, which is referred to in Arabic as Haram as-Sharif, “the Noble Sanctuary.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, Umar did not receive any direct 'revelation' about the exact location of the mosque built by Solomon (where Muhammad prayed). Instead, he consulted the locals, who identified the site where the Jews believed Solomon's Temple once stood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, logically speaking: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Either the present Dome of the Rock is standing upon Solomon's Temple, or it is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not sacred&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;, as Umar constructed it based on an incorrect location identified by the Jews. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why was Solomon building STATUES, when they are HARAM (forbidden) to build?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Islamic doctrine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All prophets were Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And all prophets refrained from committing any major sins, especially shirk (شرک), which is the act of worshipping any deity other than Allah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And building statues is strictly forbidden (haram) in Islam as it is considered a form of shirk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the Quranic story of Solomon, it is mentioned that Solomon commanded the jinn to create statues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/34/13/default.htm&quot;&gt;34:13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;... یَعۡمَلُونَ لَهُۥ مَا یَشَاۤءُ مِن &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;مَّحَـٰرِیبَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَتَمَـٰثِیلَ وَجِفَانࣲ كَٱلۡجَوَابِ وَقُدُورࣲ رَّاسِیَـٰتٍۚ ٱعۡمَلُوۤا۟ ءَالَ دَاوُۥدَ شُكۡرࣰاۚ وَقَلِیلࣱ مِّنۡ عِبَادِیَ ٱلشَّكُورُ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They (the Jinns) made for him (Solomon) whatever he desired:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt;high ARCHES&lt;/span&gt; and (grand) STATUES,&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;basins like reservoirs, and large cooking vessels fixed in their places&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, one wonders, why was Solomon building STATUES when they were forbidden to be made? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then we understand it when we read the following story in the Bible (&lt;strong&gt;1 Kings 11:7-8:). &lt;/strong&gt;These verses describe Solomon's turning away from God (i.e. indulging in SHIRK) and building high places (arches) for other gods, influenced by his foreign wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2011&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;1 Kings 11&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-1&quot;&gt;King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;besides Pharaoh’s daughter—Moabites, Ammonites,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9111&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;They were from nations about which the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.” Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9112&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and his wives led him astray.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9113&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and his heart was not fully devoted&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;his God, as the heart of David his father had been.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9114&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-5&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;5 &lt;/sup&gt;He followed Ashtoreth&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molek&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the detestable god of the Ammonites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9115&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-6&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;6 &lt;/sup&gt;So Solomon did evil&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in the eyes of the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; he did not follow the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;completely, as David his father had done. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9116&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-7&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;7 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;high place (arch)&lt;/span&gt; for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-9117&quot; class=&quot;text 1Kgs-11-8&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt;8 &lt;/sup&gt;He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the stories about Solomon that reached Muhammad, he was depicted as constructing towering buildings and statues of deities. Muhammad incorporated these narratives into the Quran. However, as a human, Muhammad overlooked the fact that he had previously declared the building of statues as Haram (forbidden) and a part of the unforgivable sin of SHIRK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible vs. Quran: Did Solomon Possess Supernatural Powers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran attributes several supernatural powers to Solomon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control over the Wind:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 34:12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control over the Jinn:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 34:12-13&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding of Animal Speech:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 27:16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Army Comprising of Jinn, Humans, and Birds:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 27:17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summoning the Queen of Sheba's Throne:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 27:38-40&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to Melt Copper:&lt;/strong&gt; Quran 34:12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Bible does not ascribe any supernatural powers to Solomon, depicting him instead as an ordinary human. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction of Solomon's Temple:&lt;/strong&gt; The Bible describes Solomon using human labor to build his temple, not jinns (1 Kings 6:14-38).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Queen of Sheba's visit, the Quran presents a supernatural account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.38?context=5&quot;&gt;27:38-40&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon asks his assembly of jinn who can bring the Queen's throne to him before she arrives. A powerful jinn responds, but one with knowledge from the Scripture brings it within the twinkling of an eye. Solomon then acknowledges this as a test from his Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Bible describes a physical journey by the Queen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Chronicles 9:1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame and traveled to Jerusalem with a grand caravan to test his wisdom, bringing spices, gold, and precious stones. She engaged Solomon in conversation about everything on her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is another ancient text called the &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testament of Solomon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; which was not included in the Bible but gained notoriety for its fantastical accounts of Solomon's supernatural abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key points from the &quot;Testament of Solomon&quot; include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solomon's Seal:&lt;/strong&gt; The text describes Solomon receiving a magical ring from the archangel Michael, granting him the power to command demons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the Temple:&lt;/strong&gt; Solomon uses the ring to subjugate demons, forcing them to assist in the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interrogation and Binding of Demons:&lt;/strong&gt; The text details Solomon interrogating various demons, discovering their activities and methods for countering them, binding them, and making them work under his command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad was an illiterate. He did hear stories of the Bible, but that didn't make him a 'Scholar' of the Bible. Therefore, he was unable to differentiate between the genuine Biblical accounts of Solomon and the other fantastical stories associated with Solomon. Consequently, Muhammad included these supernatural tales in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There are no JINNS present in the Bible, but this concept has pre-islamic pagan roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Jinns in Islam has its roots in pre-Islamic pagan beliefs and is not found in the Bible. In the Bible, the only supernatural beings are fallen angels or demons, which are distinctly different from Jinns in several key ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Origin and Creation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jinns&lt;/strong&gt;: In Islamic tradition, Jinns are created from &quot;smokeless fire,&quot; a concept not present in any biblical scripture. Muhammad introduced this idea, which aligns with pre-Islamic Arabian beliefs where Jinns were considered supernatural entities that could interact with humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bible speaks of &lt;strong&gt;fallen angels&lt;/strong&gt; (like Lucifer and his followers), but they are created as angels, spiritual beings, and are not linked to fire. These angels rebelled against God and became the devils or demons. There is no mention in the Bible of entities created from fire or with the specific attributes of Jinns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Structure&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jinns&lt;/strong&gt;: In Islam, Jinns have their own social structure, with the ability to marry, bear children, and have families. This is not a feature of fallen angels or devils in Christianity, which are generally seen as singular beings, not engaging in human-like familial relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible&lt;/strong&gt;: Fallen angels in Christian scripture do not have families. The idea of angels mating with humans is rejected in biblical texts, though some apocryphal texts (like the Book of Enoch) mention angels interbreeding with humans, but this is not a mainstream biblical teaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion and Conversion&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jinns&lt;/strong&gt;: Islam holds that Jinns can convert to Islam or any other religion and be guided by prophets. This idea reflects a deeper spiritual interaction between humans and Jinns, showing a level of submission to religious guidance similar to humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bible does not suggest that fallen angels or demons can &quot;convert&quot; to Christianity. They are seen as eternally fallen, with no hope for redemption. The concept of spiritual beings changing faiths is absent from biblical doctrine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function in Worldly Affairs&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jinns&lt;/strong&gt;: In Islamic tradition, Jinns are sometimes seen as beings who can be controlled and made to serve human interests, such as constructing palaces or performing other tasks. This reflects the magical and supernatural role that Jinns played in Arabian folklore and pre-Islamic religions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no biblical concept of fallen angels or devils being used in worldly affairs, such as building structures or performing tasks for humans. Demons are portrayed as harmful and rebellious, influencing humans to sin but not serving human interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the concept of Jinns in Islam is borrowed from pre-Islamic, pagan beliefs and has no parallel in the Bible. The Bible discusses fallen angels or demons, but these are entirely different entities, with distinct characteristics and roles. The parallels between Jinns and pre-Islamic deities or spirits suggest that Muhammad adapted this concept to Islam, mirroring the beliefs of the cultures he encountered rather than introducing a wholly unique idea. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

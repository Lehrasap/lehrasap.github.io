			<description><![CDATA[<p>Imam al-Haithami recorded this tradition (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111227003927/http://islamport.com/d/1/krj/1/81/1290.html">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>رأيت رسول الله صلى الله عليه و سلم فرج ما بين فخذي الحسين و قبل زبيبته<br>رواه الطبراني و إسناده حسن</p>
<p>I saw the <strong>Messenger of Allah pbuh putting Husein’s legs apart and kissing his penis</strong>.<br>Related by Al-Tabarani and it's chain of narration is GOOD (حسن).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imam al-Dhahabi recorded similar tradition in his book History of Islam, and declared its narrator Qabus to be Good in Hadith (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220818084128/http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/3515_%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%87%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A4/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_32">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَقَالَ جَرِيرُ بْنُ عَبْدِ الْحَمِيدِ ، عَنْ قَابُوسَ ، عَنْ أَبِيهِ ، عَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ: أَنّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ " فَرَّجَ بَيْنَ فَخِذَيِّ الْحَسَنِ وَقَبَّلَ زَبِيبَتَهُ "<strong> قَابُوسُ : حَسَنُ الْحَدِيثِ</strong></p>
<p>Jarir from Qabus bin Abi Zayban, he from his father, who from Ibn Abbas: I saw the <strong>Messenger of Allah pbuh putting Hassan’s legs apart and kissing his penis</strong>. And Qabus bin Abi Zayban is Good in Hadith (حَسَنُ الْحَدِيثِ)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Arabic, the word that is used for 'penis' is 'ذکر'. But in this tradition, the word 'زبيبته' has been used for penis, which is considered as a vulgar word for penis in the Arabic language. </p>
<p>Anyhow, this tradition became a problem for Islam apologists. And they tried to use the same tactic which they use every time in such situations i.e. they declared this tradition to be 'weak ضعيف'. They developed this so-called 'Ilm-ul-Hadith' in order to use it as a tool to discard all those Ahadith, which question the honour of Islam. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, a lie always causes some 'contradictions'. This same contradiction happened with this Hadith too. Islam apologists claimed that one narrator Qabus bin Abi Zayban is declared weak. But they don't tell that many Hadith Scholars declared this same person Qabus bin Abi Zayban to be Trustworthy too and accepted his Ahadith. Let us see those Scholars who accepted his Ahadith (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220818104834/https://en.ahlulbait.one/2021/01/20/opponents-about-kissing-the-intimate-area/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Qabus Ibn Abi Zabyan قابوس بن أبي ظبيان</strong></span></p>
<p>قال محمد بن أحمد الذهبي: قابوس حسن الحديث</p>
<p>Muhammad ibn Ahmad Adh-Dhahabi says: “Qabus is good (Hasan) in traditions.” [Tarikh-ul-Islam, Vol. 4 page 36.]</p>
<p>قال نور الدين الهيثمي: وإسناده حسن</p>
<p>Nur-ud-Din Al-Haithami says: “Its chain of transmission is good (Hasan).” [Majma’-uz-Zawa’id, Hadith 15108.]</p>
<p>قال يحيى بن شرف النووي: صحيح</p>
<p>Yahya Ibn Sharaf An-Nawawi says: “Authentic (Sahih).” [Al-Majmu’, Vol. 2 page 47.]</p>
<p>قال إسلاموب نت: مقبول</p>
<p>Islamweb.net says: “Accepted (Maqbul).” [Al-Mu’jam-ul-Kabir, Number 2590.]</p>
<p>قال محمد بن عيسى الترمذي: حسن غريب</p>
<p>Muhammad Ibn Isa At-Tirmidhi says: “Good (Hasan), strange (Gharib).” [Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Hadith 1053.]</p>
<p>قال الحاكم النيسابوري: هذا حديث صحيح الإسناد ولم يخرجاه</p>
<p>Al-Hakim An-Naisaburi says: “The tradition is authentic (Sahih) according to its chain, but the two (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not publish it.” [Al-Mustadrak Ala As-Sahihain, Hadith 6995]</p>
<p>قال ابن حجر العسقلاني: أخرجه الطَبراني وفيه دليلٌ على أن الصَبي ليست له عروة</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani says: “At-Tabarani reported it and it is a proof, that a little child has no nakedness to cover.” [Ad-Dirayah Fi Takhrij Ahadith Al-Hidayah, page 124]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyhow, this same tradition was also recorded from another chain of narrators by Ibn Abi Layla. Imam Bayhiqi recorded it in his book (<a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=m59JCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT214&amp;lpg=PT214&amp;dq=%D9%81%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A1+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86+%D9%81%D8%A3%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84+%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%BA+%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87+%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B9+%D8%B9%D9%86+%D9%82%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%87+%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84+%D8%B2%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%87&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OFgYk_sei7&amp;sig=ORam8H17jWq_CL2hAAbHEa6Jbtc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWo_f99OLKAhVGhiwKHc4QD-gQ6AEIaDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%D9%81%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86%20%D9%81%D8%A3%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84%20%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%BA%20%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%20%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B9%20%D8%B9%D9%86%20%D9%82%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%87%20%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84%20%D8%B2%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%87&amp;f=false">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أنبأ أبو بكر القاضي وأبو سعيد بن أبي عمرو قالا نا أبو العباس محمد بن يعقوب ثنا محمد بن إسحاق ثنا محمد بن عمران حدثني أبي حدثني بن أبي ليلى عن عيسى عن عبد الرحمن بن أبي ليلى قال : كنا عند النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم فجاء الحسن فأقبل يتمرغ عليه فرفع عن قميصه وقبل زبيبته</p>
<p>Abdul Rehman said: We were with the prophet (saw) when Hassan came to him. Then the messanger of Allah lift up his (al Hassan’s) shirt and kissed his penis. (al-Bayhiqi declared that it's chain of narrators is not strong)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the narrators of this Hadith are trustworthy, except for Muhammad ibn Abi Layla. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, none blamed Muhammad ibn Abi Layla to be a liar. At maximum, they objected that his memory is not strong. But according to their own rules of Ilm-ul-Hadith (i.e. Science of Hadith), a Hadith cannot be rejected completely only one the basis of weak memory of one narrator. A weak memory can cause small mistakes like change of names e.g. taking name of Hassan instead of Hussain etc, but the whole incident is not rejected. Especially in such cases, when the same tradition has also been recorded by ANOTHER chain of narrators too (for example, Qabus also narrated same tradition from another chain of narration). Both of these two Ahadith, with entirely different chain of narrators are supporting and thus strengthening each other and together they bring it to the level of Sahih (authentic) Hadith. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is why Ibn Kathir wrote in his book al-Badaya wa al-Nahaya (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220818101407/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;ID=894&amp;flag=1&amp;bk_no=59">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وهو أكبر ولد أبويه وقد كان رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) يحبه حباً شديداً حتى كان يقبل زبيبته وهو صغير وربما مص لسانه واعتنقه وداعبه.</p>
<p>Hassan was the eldest one among his siblings and the messenger of Allah loved him so strongly that he used to kiss his penis. And while Hassan was a little boy, that is why he also sucked his penis with his tongue. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>This Hadith is even part of Islamic Fiqh</h2>
<p>Muslim Scholars of Fiqh use only those Ahadith in Fiqh Rulings, which they consider to be authentic enough for this purpose. And they indeed considered this Hadith of kissing the penis of Hassan to be strong enough to be used in Fiqh Rulings i.e. they allow in general to kiss the penis of a small boy. </p>
<p>Ibn Qadama wrote in his Fiqh book 'Al-Mughani' (<a href="https://ar.wikisource.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%8A_-_%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9_2">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وعن الزهري و الأوزاعي لا وضوء على من مس ذكر الصغير لأنه يجوز مسه والنظر إليه وقد روي عن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم أنه قبل زبيبة ال<mark data-markjs="true">حسن</mark> وروي وروي أن النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم مس زبيبة ال<mark data-markjs="true">حسن</mark> ولم يتوضأ</p>
<p>According to Imam Zuhri and Imam al-Owza'ii it is not needed to do Wadhu (ritual washing) again after touching the penis of a small boy, and it is also also allowed to see and touch it. And it is narrated from the Messanger of Islam (saw) that he kissed the penis of al-Hassan and he didn't do his Wadhu again. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Taymiyyah wrote in his Fatwa book 'مجموع الفتاوی' (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210428142824/https://i2.wp.com/ahlulbayt.one/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/majmu3-e-fatawa-b-21-s-522.jpg">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>قال أحمد بن تيمية: وقد كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يقبل زبيبة الحسن</p>
<p>Ahmad bin Taymiyyah said: The Messanger of Allah (saw) used to kiss the penis of al-Hassan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Imam al-Nawawi wrote in his Fiqh Book (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210428141554/https://i2.wp.com/ahlulbayt.one/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/majmu3-e-nawawi-b-2-s-46-47.jpg?ssl=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>قال يحيى بن شرف النووي: وقال بعض أهل العلم ينقض مسه ذكر نفسه دون غيره واحتج لهؤلاء بحديث طلق بن علي رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم سئل عن مس الذكر في الصلاة فقال: هل هو إلا بضعة منك وعن أبي ليلى قال كنا عند النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فأقبل الحسن يتمرغ عليه فرفع عن قميصه وقبل زبيبته ولأنه مس عضوا منه فلم ينقض كسائر الأعضاء واحتج أصحابنا بحديث بسرة وهو صحيح كما قدمنا بيانه وبحديث أم حبيبة قالت: سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول: من مس فرجه فليتوضأ قال البيهقي: قال الترمذي سألت أبا زرعة عن حديث أم حبيبة فاستحسنه قال ورأيته يعده محفوظا</p>
<p>“Some of the people of knowledge say: ,,The ablution is broken by touching one’s own penis excluding the other.” And I reply to these people with the proof of the tradition of Talq Ibn Ali, may God be pleased with him, that the Messenger (s.) was asked about touching from the penis in prayer, whereupon he said: “Should it be something other than a piece of you?” And through Abu Lailah, who said: “We were with the Prophet Muhammad (s.), whereupon Al-Hasan came rolling on him. Then he removed his shirt and kissed his penis.” And because he touched a part of his body,the ablution was not broken like the rest of the body parts and our companions prove it with the narration of Busrah and it is authentic (Sahih) just as we have submitted its explanation and in a narration Umm Habibah said: “I heard the Prophet Muhammad (s.) say: “Whoever touches his own private parts should perform the ablution.” Al-Baihaqi commented that At-Tirmidhi said: “I asked Abu Zur’ah about the narration of Umm Habibah, whereupon he considered it good (Hasan).” He said: “I saw him considering it as being preserved.” [Al-Majmu’, Vol. 2 pp. 46 – 47]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">– An-Nawawi takes the report as evidence<br>– He does not reject the intimate kiss<br>– He accepts that the Prophet (s.) kissed the part<br>– He explains the intimate kiss in accordance with ablution<br>– He proves the evidence through his companions<br>– He confirms that it is authentic <strong>(Sahih)</strong>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220818104834/https://en.ahlulbait.one/2021/01/20/opponents-about-kissing-the-intimate-area/">link</a>)</p>
<p>Imam Ibn Hajar, after quoting this narration in his book <em>Al-Dariyah fi Takhrij Ahadith al-Hidayah</em>, writes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210428140301/https://i0.wp.com/ahlulbayt.one/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/derayat-dar-ta5rij-s-123-124-scaled.jpg?ssl=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>قال ابن حجر العسقلاني: أخرجه الطَبراني وفيه دليلٌ على أن الصَبي ليست له عروة</p>
<p><em>"Al-Tabarani narrated it, and it contains evidence that a small child does not have 'Awrah (the part of the body that must be covered)."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a mother touches or holds such parts of a child's body while cleaning or taking care of them, there is nothing improper about it. However, kissing those parts (even if done by the mother) is an act contrary to natural decency.</p>
<h2>Muslim Defence 1: This practice is also found in other religions</h2>
<p>One person, in defence of the Prophet, has written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This act has been a common practice in various cultures around the world. Jews still suck the blood from penis after circumcision. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our Response</strong>: Muslims argue that it was an expression of intense love and had no connection to lust.</p>
<p>The problem is that even if one accepts this argument under the assumption of "good intent," it remains extremely difficult to justify this act from a rational or natural perspective.</p>
<p>If people can use this excuse to kiss the penis of a male child, then they can also use the same excuse to tickle the body parts of a female child. </p>
<p>It is precisely due to this natural disposition that Muslims today do not practice this Sunnah. Instead, they find the act repulsive and attempt to distance themselves from it by labelling the relevant Hadiths as weak (Da'if).</p>
<p>It should have been known to Allah and the Prophet that the genital area harbours more disease-causing germs and that this is not a good practice. This is likely why this custom naturally disappeared worldwide over time.</p>
<p>If a false tradition goes against humanity and natural disposition, it will always be criticized and condemned, regardless of which culture it originates from or even if it is practised worldwide. If the Prophet truly came to save humanity from wrong practices, he should have ended such a harmful tradition instead of perpetuating it.  </p>
<p>Natural disposition is neither tied to religion nor culture, but rather to humanity itself. That is why, humanity within us automatically guide us that such actions are bad. That is why marriage of small girls is opposed. That is why criticism is present when the prophet married a 9 year-old-girl. If any DIVINE and 100% perfect Allah is present in the heavens, then He should have abolished this practice, instead of supporting it and making it Halal by letting the prophet marry such a 9-year-old girl. </p>
<p>This is why Muslims themselves have abandoned this Sunnah of their Prophet and are now trying to dismiss it by labelling it as a weak Hadith. If the same act had been done by a non-Muslim instead of the Prophet of Islam, Muslims would never have forgiven it under the guise of "intense love" and would have strongly condemned it.  </p>
<p>Until Muslims were unaware that their Prophet also practised this, they used to mock and criticize Jews for it. But now that they have learned about it, even the actions of Jews in this regard have become acceptable and praiseworthy to them.</p>
<h2>Muslim Defence 2<strong>:</strong> First prove the concept of nature, and answer the issue of oral sex among adults.</h2>
<p>One individual has raised this objection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the genital area contains germs, odors, and is repulsive, then oral sex among adults would also go against natural disposition. So why is it supported by the West and the atheist community?</em></p>
<p>Additionally, <em>first prove the existence of natural disposition, because Michael Foucault and many modern philosophers reject the notion that such a thing as human nature exists.</em></p>
<p><em>In today's era, even LGBT (including homosexuality) is being labeled as natural. What is your opinion on this—do you consider LGBT a part of natural disposition? Is the West promoting it for this reason?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our Response:</strong></p>
<p>Muslims often believe that their God is 100% perfect and has created the world in a flawless, 100% perfect way.</p>
<p>However, from our perspective, the world is far from perfect. Nature follows its own course, evolving as it sees fit. To survive, humans must adapt, make <span style="color: rgb(224, 62, 45);"><strong>compromises</strong></span>, and align themselves with the realities imposed by nature.</p>
<p>Take oral sex among adults as an example—it's certainly not a perfect practice. Genital areas carry germs, there is a risk of disease, unpleasant odours are present, and many people find the act distasteful.</p>
<p>Yet, the paradox of nature lies in the human sexual drive, which overrides feelings of repulsion or concerns about hygiene and health. In pursuit of sexual gratification, people make <strong>compromises</strong> and engage in these acts despite the risks involved.</p>
<p>But there is no such intense sexual gratification involved in the case of child that people have to make compromise. Instead of sucking the child's penis (which has germs and odour and danger of diseases), one can simply kiss on cheeks, forehead, or hands to show love. </p>
<p>You mentioned Michael Foucault and other philosophers to question the concept of natural disposition. Here's the response: If we were debating with those philosophers, we would certainly engage in a discussion about the existence of natural disposition. However, this debate is between you Muslims and us. Since Muslims acknowledge natural disposition and often use it as a basis to oppose homosexuality, it is entirely valid to present arguments rooted in natural disposition against you. You cannot simply deny its relevance when it challenges your position.</p>
<p>This is why it’s surprising when Muslims undermine or distort the concept of natural disposition but still claim that Islam is the "religion of nature."</p>
<p>Regarding your objection to homosexuality, the response aligns with the earlier discussion on oral sex. Despite the associated discomfort or repulsion, nature's irony is that for same-sex individuals, this act is the only way to achieve sexual satisfaction. Without it, their lives can spiral into distress—they may develop mental health issues or even become suicidal. For them, compromising in this way becomes necessary to maintain their well-being<span style="font-size: 1rem;">.  </span></p>
<p>If a 100% perfect God does exist, then even He forgot to create things in a 100% perfect manner, making this compromise necessary.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Discovery%20Knowledge%20and%20Extremism.png" alt="Discovery, Knowledge and Extremism: Reasons for leaving Islam" width="768" height="1097" loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/Discovery Knowledge and Extremism.png"></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Errors in The Quran and Proofs of Its Humanness</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>A Translation From Arabic</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Criticism.. is the friend of belief. Your friend is that who says what is right, not who says you are right. Rather, they are a pair that cannot be separated unless the balance of truth is disturbed. Religion is based on belief; and belief is ideas. No idea should be immune from criticism and skepticism, with full respect for its believers and any noble values ​​it may contain.</p>
<p>Despite the ban imposed by some governments, criticism of religions is useful, important, even necessary, in order to see the truth as truth so we follow it, and to see falseness as falseness so we avoid it, and for the sake of having the empowerment by rightness substitute the rightfulness by power.</p>
<p>Extremism.. is a relative attribute, with a disputable definition that cannot be settled, but I think that its worst form is what leads the holders of some belief to claim that their belief invalidates the other beliefs and that it must be imposed on an entire people, and pushes them to terrorism toward that who disagrees with them, and to harming that person or even killing him|her, whether formally through a government or personally through an extremist individual or group.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that we don’t know all the answers is better for us than taking the wrong answers, delusionally or arrogantly. To see things as they truly are, it is necessary to strip the mind of inherited beliefs so that it gets freed from their influence. That who cannot leave them, at least, when searching or contemplating, he|she should put them in the “silent” mode.</p>
<p>After the spread of the Internet, and despite the semi-full blockade imposed by the Saudi government against websites critical of religion and politics, I had curiosity and tendency to liberty and exploration of the hidden; so I got into the habit of bypassing the blockade. After some time, I viewed information that was not previously available when governments fully controlled the media and education: What the critics of Islam have published on strong proofs for the humanness of religion. And by pondering them, with the ability to understand classic Arabic.. I attained awareness, and realized the extent of falsity, and the magnitude of the greatest historical deceit. So I left religion on that basis.</p>
<p>Over the years.. I gathered the strongest proofs, paraphrased them, and finally documented them in this book, along with my own research and thoughts, to arm myself with it in defending my position. Praise and thanks to those who preceded me in discovering and publishing them (Christians and irreligionists), and because of them I knew many of them. These proofs implicate the three Abrahamic religions, as they have the same flaws. No difference between us and the followers of any other religion; the children inherit the beliefs of parents through hundreds of years, and they are mere beliefs.. most of which are delusive, built on fraud and myth, and enticement and intimidation.</p>
<p>To the scholars of Quran and Hadith I say: If you don’t know, then it’s a calamity, and if you know, then the calamity is greater.<br>Dear reader, the Quran says: “Will they not ponder the Quran? Or are there locks upon their hearts?” 47|24 I – This book helps you to do that, if you’re one of those who prefer truth over delusion; it is directed to anyone who believes in the Islamic belief especially and the Abrahamic belief in general, and anyone who is interested, in order to contribute to the materialization of humanity, freedom and dignity for all people, and the abatement of physical and mental terrorism; and it is a means of defense, not offense, as its main purpose is to record and explain the reasons that pushed me to leave the religion, and more reasons that would make others leave it or avoid it, and to prove that the irreligionist.. left falseness for the sake of becoming on the right path to truth.</p>

<p>Humans have long acknowledged the benefits of practices like yoga and fasting. However, attributing these practices to specific religions, such as yoga in Hinduism or fasting in Islam, does not validate the truth of those religions. Even though fasting may have positive effects, its existence predates Islam and likely predates many other religions as well. There is proof that Muhammad copied the whole month of fasting and Eid al-Fitr from Harranians. </p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge the benefits of fasting, but the problematic issue lies in the "out of balance" approach that Islam takes, turning a potentially beneficial practice into a harmful one. These imbalances in Ramadan fasting highlight the absence of a divine Allah in the heavens, suggesting that Muhammad was crafting revelations independently. As a human being, he was not all-knowing, and his human errors in the rulings of Ramadan further emphasize this point.</p>

<h2 align="left"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId385168"></a>Ramadan: The "out of balance" Islamic approach</h2>
<p align="left">Basically, Islamic Fasting is nothing else than:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p align="left">Disturb your sleep and wake up in the middle of the night which <strong>opposes the health principles</strong>. It is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suhur#:%7E:text=%27of%20the%20dawn%27%2C%20%27,is%20eaten%20before%20fajr%20prayer.">Suhur (<span lang="ur-PK">سحر</span>)</a> i.e. 'pre-dawn meal' before the start of the fast. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">The duration between night dinner (a heavy meal) and Suhur (again a heavy meal at the last part of the night) is not long enough for the stomach to digest the previous food that was eaten at dinner. Therefore, eating once again at Suhur in the state of an already full stomach is against wisdom (it again <strong>opposes the health principles</strong>). Even animals are wise enough and if cattle and horses are fed in the middle of the night or even before dawn, then they don’t touch food. They start eating only after dawn. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">And after eating a meal at Suhur, immediately running towards the mosque and doing sit-ups and prostration during prayer with a full stomach. It is a recipe for <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/exercise-after-eating#bottom-line">stomach upset</a> and again <strong>opposes the health principles. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">Normally, many people go for a long morning walk and morning exercise and to the gym (especially in countries with a warm climates). But in Ramadan, they cannot go for long healthy morning walks or gym, while their stomachs are full of food. Moreover, they also avoid healthy activity in the morning due to the fear of becoming thirsty. Thus, gyms become empty in the morning, and there are hardly any people who go out for long morning walks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">And then spend the next 14 to 18 hours in a state of thirst and laziness and weakness and dreaming about food. The output during this whole period is minimal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">And in the evening, break the fast (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iftar#:%7E:text=Iftar%2C%20also%20known%20as%20ftoor,prayer%20for%20the%20evening%20prayer.">Iftar</a>) by attacking the food and eating all types of unhealthy foods. There are two factors involved. One is hunger and thirst, while the other is Muslims cooking their most delicious and their most expensive food during the month of Ramadan, which makes it difficult for people not to over-eat. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">And after some time again start eating the night dinner (although the stomach is still full of the evening Iftar eating). It again <strong>opposes the health principles</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">After taking dinner, immediately run towards the mosque for the 'Isha and Tarawih Prayer and spend the next one and a half hours in a state of standing and pain (once again it <strong>opposes the health principles</strong> as the human body does not need this running and standing after the full stomach, but the rest so that blood can gather in the digestive tract (digestive mussels) to digest it (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126111454/https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-long-after-eating-to-workout">link</a>). You just have to watch how people are standing in Tarawih with full stomachs. They are half asleep and wishing (or perhaps even praying) only for the completion of this punishment i.e. Tarawih. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">A person needs a certain amount of liquid consumption per day. Since people cannot drink during the fasting period, thus people are <strong>Drinking + Eating</strong> at the same time at Iftar and at dinner and at Suhur (<strong>which opposes health principles</strong>). In simple words, there is never enough time to give a break between eating and drinking during Islamic fasting and people are compelled to do both at the same time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">People cannot go to bed early to sleep, as they need some time for their families too. Iftar and then Tarawih prayers in mosques waste a lot of their time which they cannot spend with their families. As a result, they are late going to bed for sleeping. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">It also affects the 'sex life'. Firstly, Muslims are allowed to do sex with their partners only during the night. Secondly, they have to take a whole body bath before the Fajr prayer. This once again reduces the time for sleep. People have to make water hot (especially in cold places and in winter). Women with long hair need a lot of time after bathing to dry their hair.  Remember, in the past centuries, people didn't have the luxury of bathrooms in their houses, and they had to go to the common Hammams. Now imagine how difficult it was for men and women to go to Hammams during the middle of the night.</p>
</li>
<li>And then repeat this unnatural cycle of eating and sleeping for the next 30 days.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId971239"></a>Muslim Preachers: Allah didn't tell us to overeat, but Muslims are responsible themselves for overeating</h3>
<p><img style="float: right; padding: 5px; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;" title="Death due to overeating in Ramadan" src="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/ramadan_overeating_death.jpg" alt="Death due to overeating in Ramadan" width="480" height="360" loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/ramadan_overeating_death.jpg">One of the most commonly cited justifications by Muslim preachers for overeating during Ramadan is that Allah didn't command overeating, and individuals are responsible for their own actions.</p>
<p>However, this rationale overlooks the fact that the supposedly All-Wise Allah seems to lack an understanding of human nature. Human hormones don't function optimally after prolonged hunger, leading individuals to react instinctively by overeating when faced with food. This response is a natural outcome in such circumstances. Despite being advised against overeating, a significant majority of Muslims continue to engage in this behavior due to the physiological impact.</p>
<p>The trend of overeating among Muslims has persisted over the past 14 centuries and is likely to continue in the future. No amount of Islamic teachings seems capable of altering this pattern, as Islam appears to conflict with human nature and the workings of hormones in such situations.</p>

<p>If Allah is truly all-Knowing, why didn't He know that women's bodies are not made for fasting for 30 consecutive days, and it will harm some of them? These poor creatures have suffered from it for the last 14 centuries.</p>
<p>Again, this "out of balance" Islamic approach proves only one thing: there exists no divine Allah in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own. Thus, he is making human mistakes here.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId235751"></a><strong>Only Thanks to Intermittent Fasting + Open Western Society that the Negative Side of Islamic Fasting + Closed Islamic Society Got Exposed</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the closed system for women in Islam, their problems and health risks due to fasting in Ramadan never came to light.</p>
<p>Every type of continued fasting poses a risk for women. The Western world realized this when intermittent fasting became popular. Some women started experiencing various problems due to continued intermittent fasting (even though they are allowed to drink water during fasting). Since the Western system is not closed in the name of modesty, issues came to light quickly.</p>
<p>Experts now recommend women practicing intermittent fasting not to fast on consecutive days due to the risks to their 'Hormonal Health' and 'Irregularities in Periods.' Women are advised to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fast on alternative days.</li>
<li>Fast twice a week.</li>
<li>Consider extending intermittent fasting to the whole year.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Women's bodies are biologically built for fertility and reproduction. Extended periods without food signal the body that it's not an ideal time for reproduction.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, "So what? I don’t want to get pregnant now or maybe ever." However, fertility isn’t the only concern. Estrogen and progesterone play vital roles in metabolism, weight loss, mood, anxiety and stress, energy, bone density, and cognitive function, among others.</p>
<p>The disease of irregular periods is easy to determine for women, but other diseases due to hormonal imbalance and others are challenging to identify. The people of ancient times had no idea about them, and these diseases continued to make women more ill internally, with no understanding of what was happening to their bodies. Allah, being All-Knowing, should protect women from such issues. Nevertheless, Allah acted in the opposite direction, making the lives of such women even more difficult through the obligation of 30 consecutive fasting days of Ramadan.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId63998"></a>Did Allah <span style="color: #ff0000;">EXEMPT</span> pregnant women from Fasting? Shameful <span style="color: #ff0000;">DISHONESTY</span>/<span style="color: #ff0000;">DECEPTION</span> of Modern Islamic Apologists</h2>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">Contemporary Islamic apologists assert that Allah exempts pregnant women from fasting during Ramadan, and some women fast voluntarily despite this exemption (e.g. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3730448/#:%7E:text=Islam%20clearly%20exempts%20fasting%20in,in%20nutritional%20demand%20during%20pregnancy.">link 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-2048-y">link 2</a>). However, this claim is far from the truth.</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">Islam's largest Fatwa website, IslamQA (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3434/" target="_new">https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3434/</a>), unequivocally states:</p>
<blockquote class="western"><strong>Question: </strong>Is it permissible for my wife who is breastfeeding my ten-month-old son not to fast during Ramadan?<br><strong>Answer: </strong>It is not permissible for a <strong>pregnant woman or breastfeeding woman not to fast unless they have an excuse</strong>. If they do not fast because they have an excuse, they have to make up for the missed fasts (later in that year).</blockquote>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB">This position is consistent across all major Sunni Imams and Zahiri Fiqh, as reflected in various Fatwas:</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(i)The Hanafi madhhab:</strong></span> ... Al-Jassaas said in Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 1/252: "If fasting will not harm them (i.e. the pregnant women) or their children,<span style="color: #ba372a;"><em> then they have to fast and it is not permissible for them to break the fast</em></span>." (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210306055839/https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66438/it-is-not-permissible-for-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women-to-break-the-fast-unless-they-fear-for-themselves-or-their-children">link</a>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(ii)The Maaliki madhhab:</strong></span> It says in Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel (2/262) : "... This (i.e. exemption or breaking the fast) is subject to the condition that her child will not accept the breast of any other woman, <span style="color: #ba372a;"><em>otherwise she (i.e. the breastfeeding mother) is obliged to fast</em></span>. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210306055839/https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66438/it-is-not-permissible-for-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women-to-break-the-fast-unless-they-fear-for-themselves-or-their-children">link</a>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(iii)The ShafI’i madhhab:</strong></span> Shafi'i Fatwa states: "<span style="color: #ba372a;"><em>It is obligatory for a pregnant or nursing woman to fast Ramadan</em></span> as long as she does not fear harming herself" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221005142501/https://islamqa.org/shafii/qibla-shafii/33688/the-fast-of-pregnant-and-nursing-women/">link</a>)</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(iv)The Hanbali madhhab:</strong></span> Ibn ‘Aqeel said that if a pregnant or breastfeeding woman fears for the pregnancy or the nursing infant, it is not permissible to fast, and she must offer the fidyah. <span style="color: #ba372a;"><em>If there is no such fear then it is not permissible for her not to fast</em></span>. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210306055839/https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66438/it-is-not-permissible-for-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women-to-break-the-fast-unless-they-fear-for-themselves-or-their-children">link</a>)</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-GB" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(v)The Zaahiri madhhab:</strong></span> It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (10/226): With regard to the pregnant woman, <em><span style="color: #ba372a;">she must fast whilst pregnant</span></em>, unless she fears that fasting may harm her or her unborn child, in which case she is granted a concession allowing her not to fast, and she should make up the fasts after she delivers and her nifaas has ended. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210306055839/https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66438/it-is-not-permissible-for-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women-to-break-the-fast-unless-they-fear-for-themselves-or-their-children">link</a>)</p>
<p>Thus, all Salaf Imams of Fiqh were unanimous that "By Default," pregnant or breastfeeding women are not exempt from fasting. They can only do so if they fear harm to themselves or their fetus/babies.</p>
<p>However, the problem lies in the fact that women are absolutely not aware of the harm fasting can cause to their bodies or their fetuses and babies, as it is a long-term and internal issue. Therefore, these pregnant women are required to fast according to Islamic rulings, as they are unaware of these long-term internal harms and are not permitted to break their fasts.</p>
<p>In essence, millions of pregnant and breastfeeding Muslim women throughout 14 centuries-long history of Islam were obligated to fast, or else they would be committing a sin.</p>
<p>Even in the 16 studies mentioned, Muslim women were allowed not to fast if they feared harm, but their continued fasting, with no apparent harm known, resulted in catastrophic outcomes.</p>
<p>Moreover, pregnant and breastfeeding women don't menstruate. This brings another problem for them that they are deprived of the natural break (i.e. 3 to 7 days break due to menstruation) during Ramadan. They are compelled to fast for 30 consecutive days, adding to the complexity and challenges faced by these women.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Islamic Apologists: There is a Hadith that pregnant women are exempted from Fasting</strong></span></p>
<p>Islamic apologists also bring the excuse that there is a <a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:2274">Hadith </a>which exempts pregnant women from fasting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response:</strong></span></p>
<p>The Muslim Hadith system is highly unreliable, with Muslim transmitters fabricating hundreds of thousands of traditions for the sake of their religion (<a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/hadith/114-the-fabrication-of-ahadith-in-order-to-save-the-honor-of-islam">Proof</a>). Consequently, the Fiqh Imams of Muslims did not consider this singular tradition to be reliable enough. Their fatwas were clear that "by default," all pregnant or breastfeeding women must fast, except if they fear harm to themselves or their babies.</p>
<p>Given this, the question arises: if Allah truly exists and is all-knowing, possessing knowledge of the Future Unseen, why did He allow the Muslim Ummah to unanimously become misguided on this issue? As a result, millions of Muslim women suffer. Why did Allah not reveal clear and easy-to-understand verses in the Quran? </p>
<p>Despite the Quran being a substantial book, Allah filled it with boasts about His powers and old fantasy stories, yet failed to provide a single clear and easy-to-understand verse that could have alleviated the suffering of millions of mothers and their babies over the last 14 centuries.</p>
<p>This proves only one thing, no all-knowing Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the Sharia Rulings on his own. Since he was only a human, that is why we see such faults in Sharia rulings which endangered and brought harm to millions of pregnant women and their babies. </p>
<h3 class="western" lang="en-GB"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Menstruating Women:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Furthermore, Islamic preachers proudly assert that Allah, in His care, exempted menstruating women from fasting. However, this assertion is false. Allah, or rather Muhammad, did not exempt menstruating women out of sympathy. Instead, the so-called Allah (Muhammad) prohibited them from fasting, deeming them impure and unworthy of worship.</p>
<p>Additionally, menstruating women are compelled to make up for missed fasts later, adding to the challenge, as it disrupts the fasting rhythm for many women.</p>
<h2>Muhammad copied the Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr from Harranians</h2>
<p>Dr. Rafat Amari wrote (<a href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/ArtMID/1379/ArticleID/9/Ramadan-and-its-Roots#_edn2">Source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ramadan was a pagan ceremony practiced by the Sabians, whether they were Harranians or Sabians. From the writings of Abu Zanad, an Arabic writer from Iraq who lived around 747 A.D., we conclude that at least one Mandaean community located in northern Iraq observed Ramadan<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/ArtMID/1379/ArticleID/9/Ramadan-and-its-Roots#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a><span dir="RTL">.</span></p>

<p>Although the fasting of Ramadan was practiced in pre-Islamic times by the pagans of Jahiliyah, it was introduced to Arabia by the Harranians. Harran was a city on the border between Syria and Iraq, very close to Asia Minor which, today, is Turkey. Their main deity was the moon, and in the worship of the moon, they conducted a major fast which lasted thirty days. It began the eighth of March and usually finished the eighth of April. Arabic historians, such as Ibn Hazm, identify this fast with Ramadan.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/ArtMID/1379/ArticleID/9/Ramadan-and-its-Roots#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a></p>
<p> Ibn al-Nadim wrote in his book, al-Fahrisit, about various religious sects in the Middle East. He says in the month in which the Harranians fasted for thirty days, they honored the god Sin, which is the moon. Al-Nadim described the feasts they celebrated and the sacrifices they presented to the moon.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/ArtMID/1379/ArticleID/9/Ramadan-and-its-Roots#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a> Another historian, Ibn Abi Zinad also speaks about the Harranians, saying that they fast for thirty days, they look toward Yemen when they fast, and they pray five times a day.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/ArtMID/1379/ArticleID/9/Ramadan-and-its-Roots#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[v]</a> We know that Muslims also pray five times a day. Harranian fasting is also similar to that of Ramadan in Islam in the fact that they fast from before the sun rises until the sunset, just as the Muslims do during the days of Ramadan.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/ArtMID/1379/ArticleID/9/Ramadan-and-its-Roots#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[vi]</a> Still another historian, Ibn al-Juzi,  described the Harranian fasting during this month. He said they concluded their fasting by sacrificing animals and presenting alms to the poor.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/ArtMID/1379/ArticleID/9/Ramadan-and-its-Roots#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[vii]</a>  We also find these things in Islamic fasting today<span dir="RTL">.</span></p>
<p>Mythological roots concerning Harran<span dir="RTL">’</span>s celebration of the moon explained the disappearance of the moon after it joined with the star cluster, Pleiades, in the constellation of Taurus. It occurred during the third week of March. The people prayed to the moon, pleading for its return to the city of Harran, but the moon refused to return. This is thought to be the explanation for why they fasted during this month. The moon did not promise to return to Harran, but it did promise to return to Deyr Kadi, a sanctuary near one of the gates of Harran. So after this month, the worshippers of Sin, the moon, went to Deyr Kadi to celebrate and to welcome the return of the moon.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/ArtMID/1379/ArticleID/9/Ramadan-and-its-Roots#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[viii]</a>  According to Ibn al-Nadim, the historian mentioned earlier, the Harranians called the feast al-Feter <span dir="RTL">عيد الفطر </span> , the same name by which the feast of Ramadan is named<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/ArtMID/1379/ArticleID/9/Ramadan-and-its-Roots#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[ix]</a><span dir="RTL">.</span></p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId727444"></a>Islamic Fasting has nothing to do with “Intermittent Fasting”</h2>
<p>Intermittent Fasting focuses on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring a full and proper sleep schedule.</li>
<li>Eating at optimal times.</li>
<li>Taking adequate rest breaks.</li>
<li>Maintaining overall daily activity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remaining active without food intake is a core principle of Intermittent Fasting. In contrast, Islamic Fasting, which prohibits both eating and drinking, leads to weakness and lethargy, hindering daily activity.</p>
<p> You will never hear that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A person on intermittent fasting asks other people to "respect" his fast and not to eat in front of him (as it happens in Islamic Fasting).</li>
<li>A person on intermittent fasting asks others to give him concessions of doing less work during his job (as it happens in Islamic Fasting all the time). </li>
</ul>
<p>The practice of not drinking water throughout the day, a feature of Islamic Fasting, lacks health benefits. Even the traditional sunrise-to-sundown fasting in Islam may not be advantageous when accompanied by large meals in the morning and evening, causing significant insulin spikes. In contrast, Intermittent Fasting, involving water intake and a longer no-food fast, aims to trigger <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/autophagy#:%7E:text=Autophagy%20is%20the%20body%27s%20way,is%20%E2%80%9Cself%2Deating.%E2%80%9D">autophagy</a> for potential health benefits.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId435526"></a>Blasphemy: Islamic Countries Punish Individuals for Public Eating/Drinking During Ramadan</h2>
<p>In Islamic countries, individuals, even non-Muslims, who publicly eat or drink during fasting hours can face punishment under the guise of blasphemy against Islamic fasting.</p>
<p>And Muslim logic for punishing that person is that he hurt the feelings of other Muslims who were fasting by eating/drinking in front of them and not showing respect to Islamic practices. </p>
<p>Muslims are strange that they get angry with others only after fasting for 12-15 hours for eating/drinking in front of them, and they want to beat and punish others for it. </p>
<p>On the other hand, these are poor children who have been suffering from hunger for years and years, but thankfully they don't apply the Muslim logic here. Otherwise, these poor children have to set the houses of Muslims on fire for hurting their feelings through their Iftar parties and all the delicious food they eat at Suhur (سحر) and Iftar. And for respecting the feelings of these hungry children, eating in public should be banned not only during Ramadan but throughout the whole year. </p>

</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The question is, why does there exist this draconian law in Islamic countries? The presence of such a law is itself a disgrace to humanity.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Shaming and harassing others for not fasting and eating</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even in non-Muslim countries, this has become a disease and Muslims start harassing non-Muslims for eating and drinking. For example, look at this video:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM" style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5SpXG_sezc" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The act of shaming and harassing others for not fasting should unequivocally be recognized as religious abuse. This trend of shaming began in schools, and unfortunately, we didn't address it effectively back then. It was imperative for governments to clearly state that children under 14 should not be fasting, especially on school days. Additionally, Muslim children should have received clear instructions not to shame others who choose not to fast or eat during Ramadan.<br>Now, it's crucial for workplaces and organizations to issue clear directives to their Muslim employees, explicitly stating that shaming others for eating during Ramadan will be considered religious abuse and will result in consequences.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"I can smell it" ... But this is the same argument that is used by Hindus in India to ban any meat consumption from Muslims. In the same way, Hindus in Muslim countries can then also use the same argument to let all meat be banned in Islamic countries.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId595194"></a>It is not necessary to stay hungry to understand the miseries of poor people</h2>
<p>Muslims also claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When rich people have to fast, then they understand the hunger of poor people too, and they help poor people more. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: </p>
<p>Firstly, if someone is crippled, then we don't need to break our leg too in order to understand his suffering. </p>
<p>Empathy with someone's suffering doesn't necessitate experiencing the same hardships firsthand. Analogously, understanding the plight of the poor doesn't require subjecting oneself to the unnatural and harmful practices of Islamic fasting; instead, it involves cultivating compassion and humanity.</p>
<p>Reality Check:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased Hunger Among Muslims:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Islamic fasting during Ramadan doesn't significantly amplify one's understanding of the hunger experienced by the poor.</li>
<li>Muslims, paradoxically, spend 2 to 3 times more on their own food during Ramadan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Economic Strain on the Poor:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The prices of essential food items skyrocket during Ramadan, exacerbating the challenges faced by the impoverished.</li>
<li>Laws prohibiting the sale of food and drinks during the day impact the earnings of small vendors, worsening the plight of the poor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Economic Downturn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Business activities plummet by approximately 78% during Ramadan, adversely affecting the income and livelihoods of the poor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Challenges for Laborers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Poor individuals engaged in labor-intensive jobs face the dilemma of how to perform strenuous tasks while hungry and thirsty.</li>
<li>The economic downturn during Ramadan further limits job opportunities for these individuals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ramadan is indeed a torment for the poor. </p>
<p>Secondly, we have to be honest and admit that fasting may increase empathy with the poor via experience as opposed to having sympathy. Besides, fasting is pretty universal in all the traditions, it is not anything Islam has a monopoly over. </p>
<p>Moreover,  we (as a non-religious society) have already adopted new traditions like Mother's Day, Father's Day, Valentine's Day, Women's Day etc. Thus, if needed, then we (as a non-religious society) are also potentially capable of adopting fasting practices and traditions which will be free of the "out of balance approach" and other evils of Islamic fasting (like 30 days of consecutive fasting and forgetting about it during the remaining year, causing health risks to women, wastage of food and resources, reduction of output and economic activities which ultimately put economic strain on the poor etc.).</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId805804"></a>Islamic Preachers: Muslims become honest during Ramadan</h2>
<p>Islamic preachers often argue that Muslims, during the month of Ramadan, exhibit heightened moral honesty, abstaining from lies and other ethical transgressions. However, this claim raises logical concerns.</p>
<p>Muslims believe that Allah's presence is constant, extending beyond the fasting period. If the perpetual fear of Allah is insufficient to deter individuals from dishonesty and other immoral acts, how can fasting alone serve as a greater deterrent? Does fasting hold more sway than the omnipresence of Allah?</p>
<p>The notion of enhanced morality during Ramadan appears artificial and potentially deceptive. Even if a temporary change occurs, it seems to dissipate after the fasting period concludes. This may explain the persistence of corruption in Islamic countries throughout the year.</p>
<p>In contrast, consider Japan, an atheist country recognized for its exceptional honesty. Japanese citizens turned in a remarkable ¥3.9 billion in lost cash to the Tokyo Police in 2019  (<a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h00709/">link</a>). The morality of atheist Japanese society is rooted in the education of "Humanity," a foundation that endures beyond temporary fasting rituals in a specific month.</p>
<p>If anything, Ramadan tends to cause people to stroke their own egos and boost their own pride or sense of self-importance.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId277122"></a>Islamic Fasting and the Misguided Notion of Sexual Self-Control</h2>
<p>Islamic preachers assert that Muslims, refraining from sexual relations with their spouses during the fasting period, acquire sexual self-control through fasting. However, this argument is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>Sexuality is a natural aspect of human life, and the idea of abstaining from it without a rational basis is questionable. Suppressing natural urges without logical reasons raises concerns about the value of such restrictions.</p>
<p>In contrast, secular societies in the West emphasize education on respecting their partners' choices. When a partner is not ready for sexual activity, individuals are encouraged to exercise self-control and respect their partners' decisions. This approach appears more reasonable than the Islamic practice of fasting, where individuals are prohibited from engaging in natural sexual activities during specific periods. Moreover, the allowance for marital rape after the fasting period undermines the concept of mutual respect for choices within marital relationships.</p>
<h2>Islamic Apologists' Claim on Low Cancer Rates in the Middle East Debunked</h2>
<p>Islam apologists often cite a specific video (<a href="https://youtu.be/539UQ-6wC3g">link</a>) claiming that the Middle East has a lower cancer rate than the rest of the world, attributing it, in part, to Islamic fasting. However, a critical analysis reveals several flaws in this argument.</p>
<p>Firstly, the video features Dr. Berg, a Westerner who may not have a comprehensive understanding of the nuances of Islamic fasting during Ramadan.</p>
<p>Dr. Berg's assertion that reduced sugar intake due to fasting is a primary reason for lower cancer rates in the Middle East is contradicted by the fact that Muslim countries experience an increase in sugar consumption during Ramadan (<a href="https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/75941/">see this Study for details - link</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, the claim that it is fasting that leads to reduced sugar intake as a cancer-preventive measure is not substantiated by evidence, but the evidence goes in the opposite direction. It may be without Ramadan fasting (and consuming a lot of sugar during this month), the rate of cancer may drop even more in Arabic countries. </p>
<p>Additionally, Dr. Berg himself acknowledges other factors such as reduced smoking and alcohol consumption in Arabic countries, suggesting that these lifestyle choices could contribute to the lower cancer rates.</p>
<p>Thus, drawing conclusions about cancer rates solely based on Islamic fasting remains unsupported by concrete evidence.</p>
<h2>Zakat Argument:</h2>
<p>Islamic preachers come up with an excuse that Zakat saves poor people during Ramadan. But we all know that Zakat system is broken in almost all Islamic countries on the state level, and there is no guarantee that every needy person get Zakat. Many people have Ghayrah and they don't want to beg for Zakat, but they are also compelled for it. </p>
<p>And here is a Study of Egypt which tells Zakat is not enough to help alleviate poverty (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230325081307/https://www.ijern.com/journal/2015/March-2015/35.pdf">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The study estimates the potential zakat collection in Egypt while the potential zakat as percentages to GDP were 1.05%, 1.04% and 1% for years 2000, 2005 and 2008 respectively. Accordingly, zakat contributes by 0.233$, 0.196 and 0.387 per day in years 2000, 2005 and 2008 respectively and these are not enough to alleviate poverty in the Egyptian Economy. </p>

<p>Please read this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ecomena.org/food-waste-ramadan/">https://www.ecomena.org/food-waste-ramadan/</a></p>
<p>Middle Eastern nations are acknowledged as being the world’s top food wasters, and during Ramadan the situation takes a turn for the worse. In the GCC nations, as per conservative estimates, around 50 percent of the food prepared during Ramadan is wasted.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Dubai Municipality estimated that in Ramadan, around 55% of household waste (or approximately 1,850 tons is thrown away every day. An estimated 4500 tons of food is wasted across Saudi Arabia during Ramadan. Food waste generation in Bahrain exceeds 400 tons per day during the holy month, according to Rehan Ahmad, Head of Waste Disposal Unit (Bahrain). As far as Qatar is concerned, almost half of the food prepared during Ramadan find its way into garbage bins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't even need any other proof for it as we see it with our own eyes throughout the month of Ramadan. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId898442"></a>Additional Muslim Excuses Debunked::</h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId575689"></a>(1) <strong>Suhur is just a midnight snack, not a proper meal</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Even if we consider Suhur as a mere snack, the practice of waking up in the middle of the night to eat before dawn raises questions about its wisdom.</p>
<p>People not only consume a so-called snack at Suhur but also engage in a lot of water intake to remain hydrated for the prolonged fasting hours. This dual process of eating and drinking at the same time is against the principles of health and contradicts the idea of a simple midnight snack.</p>
<p>Moreover, relying on a snack for sustenance throughout the day can lead to energy deficiencies, impacting concentration and performance in various activities. . It may make it difficult for you to concentrate on your studies during the whole day, or to perform your duties as a factory worker, or as an office employee. This is especially concerning for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, who, despite not being exempted from fasting, may face risks of nutritional deficiencies due to the light snacking at Suhur. It's important to note that these deficiencies may not manifest immediately but can accumulate over the 30 days of consecutive fasting in Ramadan.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId780301"></a>(2) Follow the law of the country if it bans eating/drinking publically</h3>
<p>Islamic preachers often present this excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an Islamic country, it's reasonable to adhere to local laws, including those that prohibit eating or drinking in public during fasting hours. Non-Muslims demanding compliance with secular laws in their countries while criticizing Islamic laws in Muslim countries display double standards  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: </p>
<p>Imagine if a secular Western country enacted a law banning the preaching of Islam. Would Muslims accept and follow it, or would they rightfully protest, citing violations of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>basic human rights</strong></span>? Yes, "preaching one's religion/ideology" is a basic human right, and no majority is allowed to usurp this basic human right to a minority (or even of a single individual). </p>
<p>The rule is clear: There can be no compromise on "<strong>Fundamental Human Rights</strong>". </p>
<p>This reveals a clear double standard of Islamic countries.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking are "fundamental human rights", and no law should infringe upon these rights, whether based on religion or otherwise. Therefore, we have all the right to criticize this so-called Ramadhan Blasphemy law which usurps the basic human rights of minority non-Muslims. And we also have all the right to criticize Islamic laws in Muslim countries that restrict non-Muslims from expressing their views, publishing materials against Islam, and practising their ideology freely. Such restrictions include preventing Muslims from leaving Islam and becoming ex-Muslims.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId502021"></a>(3) France also banned Hijab in schools, so don't whine about the ban on eating/drinking in public</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The next Muslim excuse is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">France banned Hijab in schools, and atheists advise Muslims to comply with French law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Only citing French law about a partial ban on the Hijab (i.e. only in schools for girls under the age of 18) and then taking shelter behind it for all the crimes against humanity in Islamic countries (like blasphemy laws and Ramadan laws etc.) is futile.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The line of reasoning for the French decision is that CHILDREN should be protected against <strong>Brainwashing</strong> by anyone (including religious brainwashing from their parents too). It is a great injustice against children to let them become the prey of this brainwashing in their childhood. This religious brainwashing is a reality, and that is why a Hindu child becomes a Hindu, a Christian child becomes a Christian, and a Muslim child becomes a Muslim after becoming an adult. Thus, children should be protected from this religious brainwashing, and they should accept any religion/philosophy on their own after becoming adults. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That is why there is already a movement demanding a ban on all such brainwashing and religious practices which are forced upon children by their parents (like taking them to mosques, churches, Hindu temples etc.). But when these children become 18 years old, then they will be fully allowed to read and decide for themselves which ideology they want to follow, including Hijab and Islam. Please read our article: </p>

</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In the French system, all children and all parents have <strong>equal</strong> rights as human beings. It is not like the Islamic system, which is an <strong>unjust</strong> system, which allows only Muslims to preach to non-Muslims, and to publish all kinds of books criticizing other religions/ideologies, but does not allow non-Muslims to criticize Islam or to publish books against Islam, or to preach their ideology to Muslims. </p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId673927"></a>(4) Ramadan fasting is a suitable starting point as an intervention for the global obesity epidemic</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>This claim is inaccurate. In reality, food consumption, including sugar, rises many folds in Muslim countries during Ramadan.</p>
<p>Ramadan fasting is associated with heightened lethargy, leading to a notable decrease in productivity throughout the entire month. Therefore, it cannot be considered a viable solution to the issues associated with the global obesity epidemic; instead, it has the potential to exacerbate existing problems.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId542931"></a>(5) Scientific study proves that people indeed lost weight during Ramadan Fasting</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muslim preachers also came up with this study (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6412279/">link</a>), which claims that people indeed lost weight during Ramadan, which may also help with cardiovascular diseases (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0939475321002234">link</a>). </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Once again, nobody denies the health benefits of fasting. But the issue is only about the "out of balance" Islamic approach. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, the reduction of weight during Ramadan is not based on any <strong>HEALTHY Physical Activity</strong> (like walking, jogging, going to the gym etc.). But it is solely based upon this unhealthy way that people don't get enough time to eat enough healthy food during Ramadan. In that small window between Iftaar and Suhur, they have not only to eat but also to hydrate themselves by drinking a lot of water at the same time. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There is a reason why fasting is not considered a healthy way of reducing weight. That is why, when Ramadan is over, then people go back to their older habits, and again start eating the same way as before, and again gain weight. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As far as Healthy Physical Activities are concerned, then they are REDUCED significantly during Ramadan, and people become extremely lazy. Moreover, they avoid morning walks or any other physical activities due to the fear of becoming thirsty so early during their fast. </p>

<h2>Until 1983, thousands of tons of Hajj meat were burnt due to spoilage and an unpleasant odour</h2>
<p>For over 1400 years in Islamic history, millions of tons of Hajj meat would spoil. To prevent the spread of diseases, the people of Mecca resorted to burning it, resulting in a foul smell that drove the inhabitants away from the city. You can read the full story here (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180813143157/https://www.thenational.ae/world/flash-freezing-takes-care-of-surplus-meat-from-haj-sacrifice-1.310668">link</a>).</p>
<p>This continued to happen until the advent of modern technology in 1983 when Western companies introduced the revolutionary method of flash freezing to preserve these large quantities of meat on a mass scale (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180813143157/https://www.thenational.ae/world/flash-freezing-takes-care-of-surplus-meat-from-haj-sacrifice-1.310668">link</a>).</p>
<p>Why did a supposedly all-wise Allah allow thousands of tons of meat to spoil every year for the past 1400 years in the name of pleasing Him?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: there is no such entity as an all-wise Allah in the heavens. Instead, it was Muhammad himself who established these regulations, and thus, we see the presence of human errors within Islamic Sharia that contradict the concept of being all-wise.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Muhammad himself wasted the meat by sacrificing one-hundred animals on Eid day </h2>
<p>Muhammad slaughtered 100 animals on Eid. And it was so much meat that he was able to take only one piece of flesh from each animal for his meal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1218a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1218a</a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">... The total number of those sacrificial animals brought by 'Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Apostle (ﷺ) was one hundred ... He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand. Then he gave the remaining number to 'All who sacrificed them, and he shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of flesh from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Prophet and Hadrat 'All) took some meat out of it and drank its soup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Islam apologists try to make an excuse that Muhammad fed the rest of the meat to the poor people of Mecca. But this seems impossible while not only Muhammad, but thousands of other people who also did Hajj along with Muhammad, also brought the animals for sacrifice along with them. And there could never be so many poor people in Mecca to finish all that amount of meat before it got spoiled and burnt/buried to avoid the smell and diseases. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Due to this Sunnah of Muhammad, still today rich Arabs (and other rich Muslims) sacrifice dozens of animals on Hajj festival only to show that they are rich. </p>
<h2>Every year, thousands of animals would perish during the arduous journey towards Mecca.</h2>
<p>In the past, the journey to Mecca for Hajj was incredibly challenging, especially for those travelling from distant cities and countries. Over thousands of kilometres, thousands of goats, sheep, and camels would succumb to death due to dehydration, lack of food, and extreme heat.</p>
<p>Only through the advancements of modern technology, pioneered by the Western world, has it become feasible to gather hundreds of thousands of animals in Mecca for the Eid festival.</p>
<p>As a result, one cannot help but question the "wisdom" attributed to the supposed divine Allah.</p>
<p>How can we accept the notion of such a deity, lacking wisdom, and responsible for the needless deaths of billions of animals over the course of the last 1400 years?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Muslim Excuse of Circulation of Wealth:</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Clearly, the killing of millions of animals in the name of Allah on the day of Eid al-Adha is a great ‘wastage’ of resources, and no divine god who has any ‘wisdom’ can order such waste. </p>
<p dir="ltr">But Muslims come up with this excuse that it is actually the ‘circulation of wealth’ which is a great way to improve the economy. Millions of butchers get jobs on this day, the transport of these animals creates jobs, and the skins of animals create jobs in the leather factories. </p>
<p dir="ltr">But this Muslim argument is against wisdom and irrational. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #020eff;">If these millions of animals are not slaughtered on Eid, <em><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">then they will not disappear from the earth</span></strong></em></span>. <span style="color: #1fa202;">No, but they will stay there and will be available for slaughter in moderation during the whole year</span>. And the butchers will get a job to do all year round, and the poor needy people will also get meat all year round, and the leather industry will also get skins all year round. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The slaughtering of millions of animal in one go doesn't create economic activity but diminish the economic circle. Especially those animals who can be utilized for breeding, milking and manuring for long life for human welfare.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you know:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">People in many poor Muslim countries (especially children) are suffering from malnourishment. </li>
<li dir="ltr">The deficiency of vitamin B12 does not go away by consuming several kilos of meat in one day or in one week, but it needs the consumption of meat in moderation throughout the year. </li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Muslim Argument: Poor people get the meat to eat due to Eid al-Adha</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Muslims proudly claim that thousands of tons of meat are sent to needy people in poor Islamic countries, and they get the chance to eat meat only due to Eid al-Adha. </p>
<p dir="ltr">But do Muslims ever question the ‘wisdom’ of Allah? </p>
<p dir="ltr">Firstly, millions of livestock are transported to Mecca from poor Muslim countries like Sudan, Somalia, Pakistan etc. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Then they are slaughtered in Mecca, and then their frozen meat is again transported <em>to those <span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong>same</strong></span> poor Islamic countries (from where the livestock actually came i.e. Sudan, Somalia, Pakistan etc.)</em>, but during this ‘<span style="color: #fe0000;"><em><strong>Double Transportation,</strong></em></span>’ the cost goes several times higher. So, what is the point of all this drama of slaughter in Mecca only? Why not send the meat directly to needy people? </p>
<p dir="ltr">And while millions of animals are slaughtered in a single day, thus<span style="color: #843fa1;"><em><strong> the price of meat goes so high</strong></em></span> in the rest of the year that poor people are unable to buy any meat all year long. In countries like Pakistan, then donkey and even dog meat is sold in the markets (<a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/1394320/donkey-meat-lahore-hides-karachi">link</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please also remember, transporting livestock is 8 to 10 times costlier than transporting meat. Moreover, you also have to transport a lot of grass and feed for the additional livestock. And you also have to make shelters for living animals, which again costs extra. And worse, still many animals die during this unnecessary transportation. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If Allah truly wanted to feed the poor, He would have instructed a method of sacrificing animals not just one day a year, but one day every month. Eating meat for only one day doesn't improve anyone's B12 levels or fulfill their protein needs. </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Muslim claim that people criticize Eid al-Adha only due to their enmity towards Islam</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Muslims claim that spending money and wasting some resources on festivals is done all over the world, why then only to target Eid al-Adha? </p>
<p dir="ltr">But again, this Muslim's claim is wrong. You will never see non-Muslims ever criticizing Eid al-Fitr (the Muslim festival which comes after Ramadhan). </p>
<p dir="ltr">Why?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please ponder upon it,<em><strong> why is it so that Eid al-Fitr is not criticized, but only Eid al-Adha is criticized?</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The answer is simple, till the time things stay in moderation, there is no criticism of it. Unfortunately, killing millions of animals in a single Eid day is beyond moderation and it is not in order to meet the necessities of humankind, but only in order to make the so-called Allah happy. </p>
<p dir="ltr">For the production of one kg of meat, 60 times more land is needed as compared to one kg of vegetables (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1179708/land-use-per-kilogram-of-food-product/">link</a>). </p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20160909171820if_/https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xlp1/v/t1.0-9/14192734_289660398080906_6043739874098580971_n.jpg?oh=815b1e2d933d0efcd4215622ed9d6df5&amp;oe=58858107&amp;__gda__=1480441109_65037b71175003db83d15619f67e1ecc" width="612" height="289" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">And 100 times more water is needed for the production of one kg of meat as compared to one kg of vegetables (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Water-needs-to-produce-1-kg-of-food_tbl1_242264738">link</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160909171949if_/https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/14203164_292144074499205_1051740107088313471_n.jpg?oh=0b386db64852e054d4f99d38be3e6211&amp;oe=5847441B&amp;__gda__=1481158208_8b8ae2a415fded678c8661d5819c7561" width="628" height="253" /></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Alone in Lahore (one city in Pakistan) 25,000 people were hospitalized due to overeating on Eid</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210725045546/https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1898961/pakistan">Link to the news</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">All-Knowing and All-Wise Allah went against <em><strong>human psychology</strong></em> when it allowed them to sacrifice whole animals, and then to eat from it themselves too. </p>
<p dir="ltr">You cannot stop people from going out of balance in such a situation. This overeating is happening for the last 1400 years, and it will keep on happening so, while it is against human psychology. </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Muslim's excuse: McDonald's also kills millions of animals</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Islam apologists start blaming us for being hypocrites that we criticize Eid, but we don't criticize McDonald's, although it also kills millions of animals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And we reply to these Islam apologists that McDonald's does not have those <em><strong>evils</strong></em>, which are involved in Eid:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">McDonald's does not slaughter all those millions of animals in one single day, but it slaughters them in moderation the whole year long. </li>
<li dir="ltr">Due to this moderation, the prices of meet do not go high up to the skies (like it happens in Islamic countries while killing millions of animals in one single day).</li>
<li dir="ltr">Due to this moderation, even poor people are able to eat meat the whole year long. While in Pakistan, they kill millions of animals in one day, and then poor people cannot afford meat for the rest of the year, and even donkey meat is sold in the market (without telling the customers that it is donkey meat). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220320051508/https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/05/25/donkey-meat-being-sold-in-the-city-with-impunity/">Link</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">McDonald's is more criticized for using chemicals in its burgers than the usage of meat patties. And this criticism is also present in the West that animals are handled poorly on the farms and they are given antibiotics and other non-healthy food for getting meat on a mass scale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But in comparison to the West, Muslims are totally unable to do even the slightest criticism of Allah for all the evils that are attached to Eid. </p>
<h2>Look at Foolishness: They killed billions of animals in the past 1400 years, but they don't even know if it was <span style="color: #120afc;"><em><strong>Ishaaq</strong></em></span> who was sacrificed or <strong><span style="color: #fb0101;"><em>Ismael</em></span></strong></h2>
<p>It seems initially Muhammad also followed the story of the Bible, and declared that it was Ishaaq who was sacrificed. But then this story became a problem for Muslims while Ishaaq never visited Mecca and a question was raised how then Ishaaq was sacrificed on the day of Hajj in Mecca? </p>
<p>Initially, Muslims tried to defend it by fabricating Hadith that like Muhammad's 'night journey' and 'ascension' on a mule-type animal, Ishaaq also reached Mecca on the day of Hajj in a miracle way. </p>
<p>Since this excuse of coming of Ishaaq through a miracle to Mecca was funny, thus later coming Muslims fabricated new Ahadith, where they started claiming that it was not Ishaaq, but Ismael who was sacrificed on the day of Hajj in Mecca. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite those dozens of later fabricated Ahadith in favour of Ismael, many of the Muslim Scholars in the initial centuries kept on believing that it was Ishaaq who was sacrificed. </p>
<p>Imam Qurtabi (under the commentary of Verse 37:102) recorded the name of Sahaba and Tabaeen who declared Ishaaq to be Zabih-Ullah i.e. the son who was sacrificed (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;tSoraNo=37&amp;tAyahNo=102&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وٱختلف العلماء في المأمور بذبحه. فقال<strong> أكثرهم:</strong> <strong>الذبيح إسحاق</strong>. وممن قال بذلك العباس بن عبد المطلب وٱبنه عبد اللّه وهو الصحيح عنه. روى الثوريّ وٱبن جريج يرفعانه إلى ٱبن عباس قال: الذبيح إسحاق. وهو الصحيح عن عبد اللّه بن مسعود أن رجلاً قال له: يا بن الأشياخ الكرام. فقال عبد اللّه: ذلك يوسف بن يعقوب بن إسحاق ذبيح اللّه بن إبراهيم خليل اللّه صلى اللّه عليهم وسلم ـ. وقد روى حماد بن زيد يرفعه إلى رسول اللّه صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: " إن الكريم ابن الكريم ابن الكريم ابن الكريم يوسف بن يعقوب بن إسحاق بن إبراهيم صلى الله عليه وسلم " وروى أبو الزبير عن جابر قال: الذبيح إسحاق. وذلك مروي أيضاً عن عليّ بن أبي طالب رضي اللّه عنه. وعن عبد اللّه بن عمر: أن الذبيح إسحاق. وهو قول عمر رضي اللّه عنه. فهؤلاء سبعة من الصحابة. وقال به من التابعين وغيرهم عَلْقَمة والشّعبي ومجاهد وسعيد بن جُبير وكعب الأحبار وقتادة ومسروق وعِكرمة والقاسم بن أبي بَزَّة وعطاء ومقاتل وعبد الرحمن بن سابط والزهريّ والسديّ وعبد اللّه بن أبي الهذيل ومالك بن أنس، كلهم قالوا: الذبيح إسحاق. وعليه أهل الكتابين اليهود والنصارى، واختاره غير واحد منهم النحاس والطبري وغيرهما.</p>
<p><br />(Qurtabi wrote) There is a difference of opinion among the scholars who was sacrificed. The <strong>MAJORITY</strong> of them said that it was Ishaaq .... <br />(Then  Qurtabi recorded the name of Sahaba and Tabaeen who declared Ishaaq to be Zabih-Ullah. <br /><strong>They were 7 companions:</strong> <br />(1) Ibn 'Abbas <br />(2) 'Ali ibn Abi Talib <br />(3) 'Abdullah Ibn Masood <br />(4) Jabir bin 'Abdullah Ansari <br />(5) Umar Ibn Khattab <br />(6) Abdullah Ibn Umar <br />(7) Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib. <br /><strong>While the following Successors (i.e. the Muslim generation after Sahaba) also considered Ishaaq to be Zabih-Ullah</strong>: <br />(1) Alqama <br />(2) Sh'ubi <br />(3) Mujahid <br />(4) Saeed bin Jubair <br />(5) K'ab al-Ahbar <br />(6) Qatadah <br />(7) Masrooq <br />(8) 'Ikrimah <br />(9) Qasim bin Abi Baza <br />(10) 'Atta <br />(11) Maqatil <br />(12) Abdul Rehman bin Sabit <br />(13) Zuhri <br />(14) Suddi <br />(15) 'Abdullah bin Hazil <br />(16) Imam Malik ibn Anas. <br />While scholars like Nahas and Tabari also declared Ishaaq to be Zabih-Ullah. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, Imam Qurtabi also recorded the name of Sahaba and Tabaeen who declared Ismael to be Zabih-Ullah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وقال آخرون: هو إسماعيل. وممن قال ذلك أبو هريرة وأبو الطفيل عامر بن واثلة. وروي ذلك عن ٱبن عمر وٱبن عباس أيضاً، ومن التابعين سعيد بن المسيّب والشّعبي ويوسف بن مِهْران ومجاهد والربيع بن أنس ومحمد بن كعب القُرَظيّ والكلبي وعلقمة.<br />(Imam Qurtabi then recorded the name of Sahaba and Tabaeen who declared Ismael to be Zabih-Ullah)<strong><br />Those were 4 Sahaba</strong>: <br />(1) Abu Hurairah <br />(2) Abu Tufail 'Aamir bin Wasila <br />(3) Ibn Umar <br />(4) Ibn Abbas. <br /><strong>And Successors are as under</strong>: <br />(1) Sa'eed bin al-Musayyab <br />(2) Sh'ubi <br />(3) Yousuf bin Mahran <br />(4) Mujahid <br />(5) Rabi bin Anas <br />(6) Muhammad bin Kaab al-Qurzi <br />(7) Kalbi <br />(8) Alqama)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, Imam Qurtabi wrote his own decision in the following words (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;tSoraNo=37&amp;tAyahNo=102&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وهذا القول أقوى في النقل عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وعن الصحابة والتابعين.<br /><span style="color: #fe0000;"><em><strong>The saying (i.e. Ishaaq was Zabih-Ullah) has been narrated through stronger traditions from the Prophet and Sahaba and Successors.</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are <em><strong>131 traditions</strong></em>, which claim <em>Ishaaq</em> was the son who was sacrificed. But later Hadith Fabrication Factory by Islam apologists fabricated <em><strong>133 traditions</strong></em> in order to counter the first Statement and they claimed it was <em><strong>Ismael</strong></em> who was sacrificed. <em>Through this, they wanted to give preference to Muhammad and his ancestor (Ismael) over Jews and their ancestor Ishaaq</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_in_Islam#The_sacrifice">link</a>). </p>
<p>A funny situation arises while there are traditions from <em>Ibn Abbas, 'Abdullah Ibn Umar, Sh'ubi, Mujahid and Alqama</em> who declare Ishaaq to be Zabih-Ullah, but at the same time there are traditions where these <em><strong>same people</strong></em> are declaring Ismael to be Zabih-Ullah. </p>
<p>How is it possible?</p>
<p>These are the contradictions which completely expose Ahadith, and Ilm-ul-Hadith, and Muslim factories of fabrication of Ahadith. </p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Normally Muhammad followed the traditions/laws of Jews. But Hajj was completely a custom of pagan Arabs and it had to do nothing with Judaism/Christianity. There is no mention of any such Hajj in the bible, or in any history book regarding Jews/Christians. And there is also no archaeological evidence that Jews/Christians took a journey towards Mecca yearly for any Hajj. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Muhammad took the basic structure of his newly formed religion from Jews/Christians, but he also included Hajj into it while he wanted to influence the pagan Arabs by continuing this practice of Hajj. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">1st Proof: Authentic Ahadith </h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to the largest Salafi Fatwa website, IslamQA (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141226115909/http://islamqa.info/en/20907" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">http://islamqa.info/en/20907</a> ), which provides "Authentic Prophetic Traditions," there are specific gaps between different prophets from Muhammad to Adam. By combining these gaps, it is estimated that Adam came about 6000 years ago, as per Islamic belief.</p>
<p>Here are the calculated gaps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The gap between Jesus and Muhammad: 600 years, as mentioned in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141226115909/http://islamqa.info/en/20907" rel="alternate">Sahih Bukhari</a>. The Bible also confirms the same as according to the bible Jesus came about 2000 years ago, and Prophet Muhammad came about 1400 years ago. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gap between Adam and Noah: 10 centuries, i.e., 1000 years, supported by an authentic tradition in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141226115909/http://islamqa.info/en/20907" rel="alternate">Sahih Ibn Habban</a>. It is the same in the Bible too, which states it was 1056 years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gap between Noah and Abraham: 10 centuries, supported by <a href="http://islamqa.info/en/20907" rel="alternate">Mustadrak al-Hakim</a> and graded as "Sahih" by Saudi Grand Mufti Albani. The Bible (<a href="http://www.bibleview.org/en/Bible/Genesis/1100Years/" rel="alternate">link</a>) also confirms a similar gap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gap between Moses and Jesus: Approximately 1500 to 1700 years, as per accounts by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141226115909/http://islamqa.info/en/20907" rel="alternate">al-Tabqaat</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141226115909/http://islamqa.info/en/20907" rel="alternate">Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani</a>, which aligns with the Bible's timeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gap between Abraham and Moses: The Bible states a gap of 245 years (6 Generations: <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Abraham-Jacob-Levi-Kohath-Amran(Imran</strong></span><em>)- Moses</em>), and Islamic sources such as Ibn Kathir (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090530114318/http://ar.wikisource.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9_%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84/%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%A9_%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%89_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85">link</a>) and Ibn Jarir Tabari (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220627132908/http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/3474_%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A1/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_270" rel="alternate">link</a>) record exactly the same genealogy from Abraham to Moses as mentioned in the Bible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By adding up these gaps, it is estimated that even within Islamic teachings, Adam came into existence around 6000 years ago, with a variation of +/-10%.</p>

<h2>2nd Proof: Al-Tabari, the age of the universe is 6000 years</h2>
<p>Al-Tabari is the most important Muslim historian. He recorded the following Traditions regarding the creation and age of the universe:</p>
<p>Hitory of Tabari, Vol. 1, pp. 172-173 (<a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=GQvdc17cJkoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+Tabari+volume+1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=seven%20thousand%20years&amp;f=false">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Ibn Humayd -Yahya b. Wadih -Yahya b. Ya'qub -Hammad -Sa'id b. Jubayr -Ibn 'Abbas: This world is one of the weeks of the other world-<b>seven thousand years</b>. Six thousand two hundred years have already passed. (The world) will surely experience hundreds of years, during which there will be no believer in the oneness of God there.<br>Others said that the total extent of time is <b>six thousand years</b>.<br><i>Those who said this<br></i>According to Abu Hisham -Mu'awiyah b. Hisham -Sufyan -al-A'mash -Abu Salih -Kab : This <b>world is six thousand years</b>.<br>According to Muhammad b. Sahl b. 'Askar -Ismail b. 'Abd al-Karim -'Abd al-Samad b. Ma'qil i -Wahb : Five thousand six hundred years of this world have elapsed. I do not know which kings and prophets lived in every period (zaman) of those years. I asked Wahb b. Munabbih: How long is (the total duration of) this world? He replied: <b>Six thousand years</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>History of Tabari, Vol. 1, pp. 183-184 (<a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=GQvdc17cJkoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+Tabari+volume+1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=statement%20corresponds%20to%20what%20we%20have%20transmitted&amp;f=false">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All these facts taken together make it clear that of the two statements I have mentioned concerning the total extent of time, the one from Ibn 'Abbas, and the other from Kab, the one more likely to be correct in accordance with the information coming from the Messenger of God is that of Ibn 'Abbas transmitted here by us on his authority: <b>The world is one of the weeks of the other world-seven thousand years</b>.'<br>Consequently, because this is so and <b>the report on the authority of the Messenger of God is sound</b>-namely, that he reported that what remained of the time of this world during his life was half a day, or five hundred years, since five hundred years are half a day of the days, of which one is a thousand years-the conclusion is that <b>the time of this world that had elapsed to the moment of the Prophet's statement corresponds to what we have transmitted on the authority of Abu Tha'labah al-Khushani from the Prophet, and is 6,500 years or approximately 6,500 years</b>. God knows best!<br>Our statement about the duration of the periods (azman) of this world from its very beginning to its very end <b>is the most firmly established of all the statements we have</b>, on account of the testimony to its soundness as explained by us. Information has (also) been transmitted on the authority of the Messenger of God to prove the soundness of the statement that<b> all of this world is six thousand years</b>. If its chain of transmitters were sound, we would have to go no further. It is Muhammad b. Sinan al-Qazzaz'43 -'Abd al-Samad b. 'Abd al-Warithf -Zabban -'Asim' -Abu Salih-Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of God said: AI-hugb is eighty years. The day of them is one-sixth of this world."" According to this tradition, it is clear that <b>all of this world is six thousand years</b>. That is because, if one day of the other world equals one thousand years and a single such day is one-sixth of this world, the conclusion would be that the total is six of the days of the other world, and that is <b>six thousand years</b>.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does "Qaran قرن" means?</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Modern Islamic apologists claim that the difference between Noah and Abraham was 10 "Qaran قرن", which in Arabic means:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">Either a <strong>Century</strong></li>
<li dir="ltr">Or a <strong>Generation</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">They calculate that, considering Noah's age of more than 950 years, 10 Qaran would equate to about 10,000 years.</p>
<p>However, this argument faces several challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>All dictionaries (<a href="http://www.lexilogos.com/english/arabic_dictionary.htm" rel="alternate">link</a>) unanimously define Qaran as Century, with "generation" being a less common meaning, if used at all.</li>
<li>The choice of Noah's age as the standard for a generation is arbitrary. Why not consider Abraham's age, who lived for 175 years?</li>
<li>Muhammad was addressing people of his era, for whom the average generation span was not more than 100 years. The Quran and Hadith were revealed in simple language to suit the understanding of that time.</li>
<li>Even if we interpret "Qaran" as "generation" and apply it only to Noah, it still does not reconcile with scientific evidence of human fossils dating back much older, around 300,000 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>It appears that the majority of Salaf (early) Islamic scholars held the view that 'Qaran' means 'century,' and the current trend of interpreting it as 'generation' seems to be a recent attempt by Islamic apologists to avoid contradictions between science and religion.</p>
<p>A tradition from Tabqat Ibn Sa'ad supports this perspective, stating that there were ten Qarns between Adam and Noah, where each Qarn was a span of one hundred years. Similarly, there were ten Qarns between Noah and Abraham, each spanning one hundred years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tabqat Ibn Sa'ad, Account of Generations and period between Adam and Muhammad (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150324031350/http://www.soebratie.nl/religie/hadith/IbnSad.html" rel="alternate">online Link</a>):</p>
<p>He (Ibn Sa`d) said: Muhammad Ibn `Umar Ibn Waqid al-Aslami informed us on the authority of more than one scholar; they said: There were ten qarns between Adam and Nuh and every qarn is a span of one hundred years. There were ten qarns between Nuh and Ibrahim and a qarn was of the span of a century. Between Ibrahim and Musa Ibn `Imrán ,there was a span of ten qarns and a qarn was equal to one hundred years. </p>

<h2 dir="ltr">3rd Proof: The "<a href="http://www.ancient.eu/Stone_Age/">Stone Age</a>" contradicts the claim that Adam existed before 10 thousand years ago</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists, in response to evidence from modern human fossils, attempted to push back Adam's arrival to around 300 thousand years ago. However, the "Stone Age" undermines their argument.</p>
<p>The Stone Age is a significant period in human history, spanning from approximately 2.5 million years ago until just 10 thousand years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><sub><a href="http://www.ancient.eu/Stone_Age/" rel="alternate">www.ancient.eu/Stone_Age/</a></sub></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Stone Age is also divided into three different periods. Paleolithic or Old Stone Age: from the first production of stone artefacts, about <b>2.5 million years ago</b>, to the end of the last Ice Age, about <strong>9,600 BCE</strong>. This is the longest Stone Age period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to modern science, various hominids, including modern humans, Neanderthals, and Homo erectus, lived during the Stone Age. They relied solely on tools made of stones or bones for hunting and other activities until just 10 thousand years ago.</p>
<p>If we were to accept the premise that Adam arrived 300 thousand years ago, as suggested by modern human fossils, it raises questions that Islamic apologists must address. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why didn't Adam teach his descendants to use more advanced tools than simple stone tools?</li>
<li>Why did his progeny continue to remain in the Stone Age for the next 290 thousand years, only emerging from it relatively recently?</li>
</ul>
<p>This line of reasoning highlights the apparent inconsistency in the apologist's argument, particularly when considering the overwhelming evidence supporting the theory of evolution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This theory of Islamic apologists (i.e. Adam came 300,000 years ago) becomes so ridiculous only while they have to deny the Theory of Evolution. </p>

<p>A hunter-gatherer is a human living a lifestyle in which most or all food is obtained by foraging (gathering edible wild plants) and hunting (pursuing and killing wild animals), in the same way, that most natural<span> </span><a title="Omnivore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore">omnivores</a><span> </span>do.

<p>As compared to domestic sheep and cows, we have fossils of millions of other animals which go back millions of years ago. And we also have cave paintings of a lot of animals, which go up to 50,000 years ago (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting">link</a>). For example, look at this cave painting from the<span> </span><b>Cave of Altamira, Spain.</b></p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But as far as domestic sheep and cows are concerned, then neither there exists any fossil of them nor any cave painting of them which is older than 11,000 years. The same is true about the dogs and neither any fossil of a dog is present, nor any cave painting present which is older than 14000 years. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islamic stories portray Adam and his descendants as cultivators of crops and herders of domesticated animals, which sets them apart from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. A specific verse (5:27) in the Quran and the commentaries of all Muslim Mufassirin present various traditions describing how Qabeel (son of Adam) offered a part of his crops as a 'sacrifice' to Allah, while his brother Habeel presented a sheep for the same purpose. These accounts reinforce the belief that Adam's lineage engaged in agricultural and herding practices rather than hunting and gathering.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For example, Ibn Kathir recorded this tradition and declared it to have a better than a good chain of narration (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=2&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>

Qabeel was the elder one, and the sister that was born along with him was more beautiful than the girl who was born along with Habeel. When Habeel wished to marry the sister of Qabeel, then Qabeel refused to accept it and said: "She is my sister as she was born along with me, and she is more beautiful than your sister, and thus I have more right to marry her.

<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId205296"></a>5th Proof: Agriculture also started only 10 thousand years ago</h2>
<p>The practice of agriculture, including the cultivation of crops, began only around 10 thousand years ago during the<span> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic">Neolithic Period</a>, which followed the end of the ice age.</p>
<p>Despite this historical evidence, both the Bible and the Quran assert that Adam initiated agriculture upon his arrival on Earth.

<p>The absence of such knowledge can be attributed to the fact that these religious texts were authored much more recently than 10 thousand years ago.

<h2>8th Proof: Prophet Idris vs. Writing with the Pen</h2>
<p>According to Islamic tradition, Prophet Idris (Enoch in the Bible) lived during the era of Adam and he is believed to have been one of the first people to write with a pen.</p>
<p>Ibn Kathir discussed Prophet Idris in his book "Stories of the Prophets" (قصص الأنبياء). In this text, Ibn Kathir mentions various attributes and contributions of Idris, including his wisdom, knowledge, and his introduction of writing and other sciences. Here is an excerpt from Ibn Kathir's "Stories of the Prophets" related to Idris:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"وذكر ابن إسحاق: أن إدريس كان أول من خط بالقلم، وقد أُلهِم علم النجوم والحساب." <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">قصص الأنبياء، ابن كثير</strong></p>
<p>"Ibn Ishaq mentioned that Idris was the first to write with a pen and he was inspired with the knowledge of the stars and mathematics." [Reference: Stories of the Prophets, Ibn Kathir]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another relevant excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ويقال: إن إدريس عليه السلام أول من كتب بالقلم، وأول من خاط الثياب ولبس المخيط، وأول من نظر في علم النجوم والحساب." <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">قصص الأنبياء، ابن كثير</strong></p>
<p>"It is said that Idris (peace be upon him) was the first to write with a pen, the first to sew garments and wear stitched clothing, and the first to study the science of stars and mathematics." [Reference: Stories of the Prophets, Ibn Kathir]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we know that humans first started to write about 6000 years ago. </p>

<p>3400 and 3100 BCE (i.e. about 6000 years ago CE)</p>
<p>Sumerian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered to be the earliest examples of true writing systems. Both gradually evolved from proto-writing between 3400 and 3100 BCE. The Proto-Elamite script is also believed to have been in use during this period.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId159179"></a>9th Proof: The challenge of Noah's Ark for Muslims</h2>
<p>According to the bible, the gap between Adam and Noah was 1056 years.</p>
<p>And this gap is the same according to Islam too. Saudi Salafi Mufti at Islam Question Answer wrote (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141226115909/http://islamqa.info/en/20907">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The period between Adam and Nooh (peace be upon them both): it was narrated from Abu Umaamah that a man said: “O Messenger of Allaah, was Adam a Prophet?” He said, “Yes, and Allaah spoke to him.” The man asked, “How much (time) was there between him and Nooh?” He said, “Ten centuries.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his <i>Saheeh</i>, 14/69; and by al-Haakim, 2/262. He said it is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Ibn Katheer said in <i>al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah</i> (1/94): this is (saheeh) according to the conditions of Muslim, even though he did not narrate it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, the fossils of modern humans and other homos compel Muslims to claim that Adam came at least 300,000 years ago, but on the other hand, they are unable to tell how Noah could have constructed such a massive vessel using only stone and bone tools..</p>
<p>In the Quran, Noah's Ark is described as being made of "<strong>planks</strong><span> </span>and<span> </span><strong>nails</strong>" (Quran 54:13), implying that it was not a primitive construction from the Stone Age. Instead, it suggests the use of more advanced materials like wood, indicating a level of technology beyond that of the Stone Age.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<span> </span><a href="https://quranx.com/54.13">54:13</a>:<br>And We carried him on (ark) made of planks and nails,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember, Muhammad came only 1400 years ago, and till his time, iron nails were available and used for naval shipbuilding. </p>
<p>The dilemma arises from the immense size of the ark, which was tasked with carrying pairs of animals from across the entire world, along with their food and water. Such an undertaking would require modern technology and tools, and even with today's technology, the largest wooden ship is only about 100 meters long. Furthermore, modern ships of this size rely on iron nails and steel wires to hold the planks together.</p>
<p>Even with the modern technology of today, the biggest ship, which is made out of wood, is only 100 meters long (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151013170709/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html">link</a>), even though not only a lot of iron nails have been used in it, but they also had to use steel wires in order to keep the planks together. </p>
<p>The question remains: how could Noah have built such a colossal ark 300,000 years ago without access to the technology we have today, including iron wires or ropes? This paradox raises intriguing challenges for Muslims seeking to reconcile the traditional timeline with the account of Noah's Ark as described in their religious texts.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId175121"></a>The oldest naval Ship is only 5 thousand years old</h3>
<p>One of the issues faced by Muslims is related to the age of the oldest naval ship.</p>
<p>According to scientific discoveries (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship#History">link</a>), the oldest known naval ship is approximately 5 thousand years old, and it was built by the ancient Egyptians. These early Egyptian ships were quite rudimentary, constructed with planks for the hulls and tied together with ropes since the technology for making nails was not yet available.</p>
<p>Researchers have come across numerous paintings depicting these early naval ships, which are around 5 thousand years old. However, there is a significant absence of any paintings representing more advanced ships older than 5 thousand years. Additionally, there are no 'cave paintings' featuring any type of naval ship, despite the existence of cave paintings dating back as far as 50,000 years.</p>
<p>As a result, this raises questions for Muslims seeking to reconcile the age of the oldest naval ship with their historical and religious beliefs. The evidence points to the fact that advanced shipbuilding techniques and representations of such ships did not exist before the time of the early Egyptian vessels, further challenging traditional narratives.</p>
<p>Here is an image of an Egyptian boat from about 4 thousand years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Egyptian boats" src="https://heartheboatsing.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/pic-42.jpg" alt="Egyptian boat building about 4000 years ago" width="500" height="415"></p>
<p>These Egyptian boats were the most advanced boats in the world from 4000 to 5000 years ago. </p>

<p dir="ltr">According to Islamic traditions, Adam came to the earth about 6,000 years ago. But science refuted this Islamic story, as it found thousands of human fossils which were way older than 6,000 years and the oldest human fossils are 300,000 years old. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Thus, modern Muslims were compelled to deny their own traditions and come up with the new claim that Adam came at least 300,000 years (or even earlier). </p>
<p dir="ltr">But again, Science refuted this Islamic claim, while the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age#:~:text=The%20Stone%20Age%20was%20a,with%20the%20advent%20of%20metalworking.">Stone Age</a>" ended only 10,000 years ago, and the first time "<a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/development-agriculture/">Cultivation of Crops</a>" also started only 10,000 years ago after the end of the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Age">Ice Age</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While according to the Islamic story, Adam was able to cultivate the crops and his son Qabeel offered the sacrifice of the grains of the crop, while another son Habeel sacrificed a sheep for Allah. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Another problem occurred with the Arch of Noah. According to Authentic Islamic Tradition, Noah came 10 Centuries (1,000 years) after Adam. But then how was Noah able to build that grand Naval Ship with "Stone Tools"? </p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age#:~:text=The%20Stone%20Age%20was%20a,with%20the%20advent%20of%20metalworking.">Stone Age</a>" means humans were able to make primitive tools out of stones or bones only.</li>
<li dir="ltr">While the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age">Bronze Ag</a>e" started 5,500 years ago only. There are no bronze tools which are older than 5,500 years.</li>
<li dir="ltr">And the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age">Iron Age</a>" started 3,500 years ago only. There are no iron tools present which are older than 3,500 years. </li>
<li dir="ltr">And the first Naval Ship is only 5,000 years old according to scientific research. </li>
<li dir="ltr">The "<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Age">Ice Age</a>" also ended 10,000 years ago, but Islam has absolutely no "clue" about the ice age. Also, the bible has no clue about the ice age. </li>
<li dir="ltr">Again Quran/Bible have zero clue about the dinosaur. </li>
<li dir="ltr">Scientists have found thousands of human fossils and stone tools which are much older than 6,000 years (and going back up to 300,000 years). <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/the-oldest-known-human-fossils-have-been-found-in-an-unusual-place/529452/"> Link</a>.</li>
<li dir="ltr">And scientists also found cave paintings by human beings which are much more than 50,000 years old. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting">Link</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In light of these scientific findings, the newer claims made by modern Muslims regarding Adam and Noah are once again refuted.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shia Islam also claims Adam (as) came about 6000 to 7000 years ago</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Please see the Tafsir al-Mizan by Shia Alim Tabatabai (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150420170031/http://islamquest.net/ur/archive/question/fa701" rel="alternate">link</a>).</p>
<h3>A reply by a Shia Scholar</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa3297">Link</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no inconsistence between these two. If we have heard that Prophet Adam has been created six to seven thousand years ago, this might refer to a different and new generation of human beings which started with Prophet Adam (A.S.) and might have been preceded by numbers of generations of human beings who have gone extinct. There is a lot of evidence in hand that suggests a whole different generation of humans unlike Prophet Adam existed before him.</p>
<p>This is also in accord with the teachings of the Quran and Islamic Hadith.<a id="_ednref1" href="https://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa3297"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">[1]</span></a></p>
<p>Allamah Tabatabai (R.A.) comments under the first ayah of surah Nisa’: “The surface meaning of the verse suggests that the term “ نفس واحدة ” is referring to Adam and “ زوجها ” to Eve, who are the mother and father of mankind. We also are from this generation<a id="_ednref2" href="https://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa3297"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">[2]</span> </a>of humans and judging by the Quran, mankind’s species goes back to them. The noble verse implies that the existing generation of human beings goes back to Adam and Eve and that nobody else has played any part in producing this generation.</p>
<p>In the history of the Jews we read that the human species we know of doesn’t surpass a history of approximately seven thousand years which seems to be reasonable. Therefore, logic suggests the same as what history dictates. But geological experts believe the history of human beings to be millions of years.</p>
<p>This is their point of view, but the proof they present isn’t convincing. We don’t have a reason that proves that these fossils belong to the ancestors of this chain of human beings we witness today. We also have no reason to believe that these fossils don’t belong to a generation or kind of beings who lived before Prophet Adam (The Father of Mankind) and were instinct way before our ancestor and were never connected to the chain of human beings we are from.</p>
<p>The Holy Quran has not explicitly explained the emergence of mankind on the planet earth, in terms of whether we were the only generation of mankind or if there were other generations before us making us the last generation.</p>
<p>From paying attention to some verses of the Quran, we can slightly deduce that before the creation of Prophet Adam (The Father of Mankind) and his generation there were other human beings who lived here, where He says: “…And when your Lord said to the angels: I am going to place in the earth a khalif (representative), they asked: Will you place in it someone who will make mischief in it and shed blood”.<a id="_ednref3" href="https://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa3297"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">[3]</span></a></p>
<p>Allamah Tabatabai says: “We can slightly deduce from ayah 30 of surah Al-Baqara that before the creation of Prophet Adam (A.S.) there was a different generation of human beings who caused the angels to ask: <a name="OLE_LINK8"></a><a name="OLE_LINK7"></a>Will you place in it someone who will make mischief in it and shed blood .”<a id="_ednref4" href="https://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa3297"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">[4]</span></a></p>
<p>This ayah implies that another generation of human beings was created before the generation of human beings we know and are part of what was created, which the angels were initially familiar with.</p>
<p>In some traditions coming from the imams (A.S.), we witness proof of the existence of eras of human beings prior to the current era.</p>
<p>Sheikh Saduq (A.S.) has narrated a hadith in which the imam tells the narrator: “You might believe that God Almighty has not created humans other than you. Well this is false because he has created millions of humans and you from the last generation of them.”<a id="_ednref5" href="https://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa3297"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">[5]</span></a></p>
<p>In <i>Khisal</i>, Sheikh Saduq also narrates that Imam Baqir (A.S.) has stated: “From the time He created the earth, God Almighty has created within it, seven worlds (and made all of them instinct), none of which were of the generation of of Prophet Adam. God created all of them from the crust of this earth and created generation after generation with corresponding worlds for all generations till finally Prophet Adam was created and reproduced his descendants solely from him.<a id="_ednref6" href="https://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa3297"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">[6]</span> </a>,<a id="_ednref7" href="https://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa3297"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">[7]</span></a></p>
<p>On this account, if we conclude that the line of history for mankind extends to a million years based on fossils found perhaps in caves, they don’t belong to the current generation of human beings, because the story of Prophet Adam appears to be about 7000 years old.<a id="_ednref8" href="https://www.islamquest.net/en/archive/fa3297"> <span style="color: #0000ff;">[8]</span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p>Certainly, there is a contradiction between Science and Islam regarding the origins of humanity.</p>
<p>The Quran does not provide any evidence of humans existing before Adam. The interpretation by this Shia scholar attempting to deduce pre-Adam human beings in the Quran is based on conjecture, which is itself considered impermissible in Shia Islam. The Quran asserts in several places that it is clear and easy to understand. So, the question arises, is there really a clear verse about humans before Adam?</p>
<p>The scholar presented two Ahadith, neither of which explicitly states that there were humans on earth before Adam.</p>
<p>The first hadith is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sheikh Saduq (A.S.) has narrated a hadith in which the imam tells the narrator: “You might believe that God Almighty has not created humans other than you. Well this is false because he has created millions of humans and you are from the last generation of them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this tradition, the Shia Imam is not talking about the creation of humans before Adam. Instead, he is discussing the creation of humans before the man he was speaking with.</p>
<p>The second hadith is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Khisal, Sheikh Saduq also narrates that Imam Baqir (A.S.) has stated: “From the time He created the earth, God Almighty has created within it seven worlds (and made all of them extinct), none of which were of the generation of Prophet Adam. God created all of them from the crust of this earth and created generation after generation with corresponding worlds for all generations till finally Prophet Adam was created and reproduced his descendants solely from him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the Imam is not referring to humans on this earth, but to humans on other earths.</p>
<p>The Quran mentions seven heavens and seven earths, and people have always wondered where the remaining six earths are and if there are people living on them. The Shia Imam, in this tradition, claims that Allah created humans who live on these other six earths as well.</p>
<p>Thus, according to this hadith, Adam and his descendants are alone on this earth.</p>
<p>Consider also that human beings have lived for 290,000 years in the Stone Age (the oldest human fossils are 300,000 years old, while the Stone Age ended only 10,000 years ago).</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>
<p>If Allah was sending prophets to the so-called generations before Adam, how could they remain in the Stone Age for such a long period of time?</p>
<p>Additionally, human beings were hunter-gatherers until 10,000 years ago (no cultivation of crops, etc.).</p>
<p>Thousands of cave paintings exist, some about 50,000 years old, yet none show anyone praying to Allah or depict mosques. Why?</p>
<p>If Adam came only 6,000 years ago, we should find abundant archaeological evidence from 6,000 to 4,000 years ago worldwide, but there is no evidence of a monolithic God, his prophets, or mosques in cave paintings, skin paintings, or stone writings, except in the small area where Jews lived. Why?</p>]]></description>

			<title>A LIST of Tehrif (Distortions) in English Translation of Islamic Texts</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islam-general/27-tehrif-distortion-in-english-translations-of-islamic-texts</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Religious individuals claim their faith has a monopoly on morals. However, we frequently observe these same individuals deceiving the public and using unethical methods to propagate their beliefs. Modern Islamic apologists, in particular, are busy distorting Islamic texts through incorrect translations and other means. This dishonesty is unfortunate.</p>
<h2>Not even 10 Jews believed in the prophethood of Muhammad</h2>
<p>The Bible contains several passages that highlight the phenomenon of divine acceptance of a person's sacrificial offering through the appearance of a mysterious fire that consumes the offering. These instances can be found in verses such as Judges 6:20-21, 13:19-20, and 2 Chronicles 7:1-2.</p>
<p>Actually, Muhammad had already made a mistake, and he had also previously confirmed this method of the miracle of fire in the Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.27">5:27</a>, in the story of Adam and his sons, where a fire appeared and consumed the offering of one son who sacrificed a sheep.</p>
<p>Consequently, when Muhammad asserted his prophethood, the Jews asked him to provide proof through the manifestation of a miracle, specifically the fire consuming his offering.</p>
<p>Muhammad found himself unable to dismiss this demand outright, as he already acknowledged it in the story of Adam in the Quran.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad resorted to a different approach, offering a new excuse. He accepted the validity of the miracle involving the fire accepting the offering, but he refused to showcase this miracle. He justified his inability to show this miracle by accusing the Jews of Medina that their forefathers sinned by killing previous prophets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/3.183?context=3"> 3:183</a>:</p>
<p>They (the Jews) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in any messenger <strong>unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire</strong> (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: <strong>why then did ye slay them</strong>, if ye speak the truth?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, this excuse by Allah/Muhammad was lame, as it is unjust to punish individuals for the sins of their ancestors. As a result, not even 10 Jews believed in the prophethood of Muhammad. </p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Note:</strong> The Islamic Translators of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim added these words in parenthesis on their own "<span style="background-color: #fcff01;"><em><strong>(amongst their chiefs)"</strong></em></span></span> or "<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;"><em><strong>Scholars of the Jews"</strong></em></span></span> It is a Distortion (TEHRIF) case, while these words have nothing to do with the original tradition, which is talking about normal 10 Jews, and not about any of their chiefs/scholars. Islamic preachers are compelled to do this TEHRIF (distortion) while it was a shame that not even 10 Jews believed in Muhammad and considered him a liar. </p>
<p>This distortion by Islamic preachers is utterly shameful and shows how dishonest they are and how ashamed they are of the truth.</p>
<p>It seems Muhammad repeated this statement multiple times, and his companion 'Auf ibn Malik is also a witness to a similar statement from him. </p>

<p>But the Jews of Medina still refused to accept him as a true prophet, and that was the point where Muhammad's enmity and hatred started against the Jews:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, Muhammad changed the Qibla once again from Bait-ul-Muqqadas to Ka'ba in Mecca. </li>

<p>Yes, that was the whole argument of Muhammad: "...<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong><span style="color: #e67e23;">that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle (only)</span></strong></span></span> ..."</p>

<p>Later Muhammad's anger and hatred against the Jews went so high that he was no more satisfied by expelling them from Medina, but he wanted to expel them from the whole Arab peninsula. It was due to the reason that it was a shame for him that he was claiming himself to be the promised prophet of the Jews, but the Jews were telling people that he was not that promised prophet. Muhammad didn't want the Jews to tell this to others, thus he wanted to expel them from the whole Arabian peninsula. </p>

<h2>Hadith of abusing Kafir to suck the clitoris of his female goddess al-Lat</h2>
<p>There is a Hadith in Sahih Bukhari, where Abu Bakr abused the ambassador of Quraysh, by telling him to "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Go and suck the clitoris of al-Lat (the female goddess)</span></strong>". Muhammad didn't stop Abu Bakr from this blasphemy but made such abuse a part of Islamic Sharia by keeping quiet about it instead of stopping Abu Bakr (This part of Sharia is known as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hazriah-Hasan/publication/336374711_PROPHETIC_SUNNAH/links/5d9ef1e0a6fdcc04fac678ad/PROPHETIC-SUNNAH.pdf">Taqriri Hadith</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/54/19">Sahih al-Bukhari 2731, 2732</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>… Then ‘Urwa said, “O Muhammad! Won’t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of any one amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.”  Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him by saying<strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">‘Go suck clitoris of al-Lat (the female Goddess)’</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>and said, "Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet  alone?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">But the Muslim English translator of Sahih Bukhari didn't translate the exact words of Abu Bakr, Instead of that, he distorted the translation and wrote (<a href="https://theislamissue.wordpress.com/2020/02/09/bukhari-translators-embarrassed-by-abu-bakrs-potty-mouth/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">" Hearing that, Abu Bakr <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>abused</strong></span> him and said, "Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet (ﷺ) alone?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">So, the Muslim translator deleted the original words"Go suck clitoris of al-Lat (the female Goddess)", and used the word "abused" instead. </p>
<p class="western">This distortion is pure dishonesty from the Muslims. They are hiding this part of Sharia of Islam, which not only allows abusing the non-Muslims, but their gods too, and that too in the worst form. </p>
<p class="western">There was no insult or abuse present in the words of 'Urwah (i.e. the ambassador of Quraysh), and he was only telling his opinion as Muslims had already run away in the battle of Uhud, leaving Muhammad alone.  </p>
<p class="western">As we made clear above according to the Islamic standards, Muhammad didn't stop Abu Bakr from these abusive words, which automatically makes it a part of Islamic Sharia. Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqallani thus made it clear (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201122233718/https://theislamissue.wordpress.com/2020/02/09/bukhari-translators-embarrassed-by-abu-bakrs-potty-mouth/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">The clitoris is the piece of flesh that remains in the woman’s vulva after circumcision. Al-Laat is the name of one of the idols that Quraysh and Thaqeef used to worship. It was the custom of the Arabs to revile one another in this manner, but by mentioning the mother, so Abu Bakr wanted to go further in reviling ‘Urwah by referring to his object of worship instead of his mother. What made him do that was his anger towards him when he accused the Muslims of being cowards and saying that they would flee. This also indicates that it is permissible to say words that are regarded as foul or bad for the purpose of rebuking one who behaves in a manner that leads to him deserving that. Ibn al-Munayir said: In the words of Abu Bakr we see an insult to the enemy, rejection of their beliefs, and highlighting the flaws in their belief when they said that al-Laat was the daughter of Allah – exalted be Allah far above that – by suggesting that if she was a daughter that she would have what every female has<br>Fath al-Bari 5/340</p>

<h3 class="western">Blasphemy Laws: The reason why the translation of this Hadith was distorted</h3>
<p class="western">On one side, extremist Muslims introduced draconian Blasphemy Laws in Muslim countries (and now want the same blasphemy laws to be introduced in the Western Secular countries too), but on the other hand, the Quran and Hadith are themselves full of insult and blasphemy of the Non-Muslims. Please read our detailed article about <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-general/5-love-vs-hijab">Blasphemy Laws and the Insult of the Opponents by Quran and Muhammad</a>.</p>
<p class="western">Thus, these extremist Muslims had to hide this Hadith from the eyes of non-Muslims (whose majority don't know Arabic), while it is impossible to argue for the blasphemy laws against Islam/Muhammad in the presence of this Hadith. Therefore, the extremist Muslims thought to achieve their goal by deceiving the people through the distorted translation. </p>

<h2>Linguistic Mistake in the Quran, Indicating Its Human Origins</h2>
<p>Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/11/default.htm">4:11</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِىٓ أَوْلَٰدِكُمْ ۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ ۚ فَإِن كُنَّ <span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong>نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ</strong></span> فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ ۖ وَإِن كَانَتْ وَٰحِدَةً فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصْفُ ۚ </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Instructs you Allah concerning your children - for the male like (the) portion (of) two females. But if there are (only) women (i.e. daughters) </span><span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;">more (than) two</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, then for them two thirds (of) what he left.

</blockquote>
<p>Allah is incorrectly using the phrase “<strong>more than two daughters</strong>” when He actually wanted to say “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”.</p>
<p>Please read the detailed article <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/166-quran-s-mathematical-mistakes-in-the-inheritance-laws">here.</a></p>
<p>It is a clear linguistic mistake, and it happened while no Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own, and he was not safe from making human mistakes like these. </p>
<p>All Muslim Scholars agree that two daughters will get 2/3 of the estate.</p>
<p>Muhammad himself distributed 2/3rd of the estate between two daughters. </p>
<p>Sunan Tirmidhi, 2092:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The wife of Sa’d bin Rabi’ came with the two daughters of Sa’d to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, these are the two daughters of Sa’d. He was killed with you on the day of Uhud, and their paternal uncle has taken all that their father left behind, and a woman is only married for her wealth.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent until the Verse of inheritance was revealed to him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the brother of Sa’d bin Rabi’ and said: ‘Give the two daughters of Sa’d two thirds of his wealth, and give his wife on eighth, and take what is left.’”</p>

<h3>Tehrif (Distortion) Case:</h3>
<p>It was such a big error, that modern Muslim Quran Translators have to make a TEHRIF (Distortion) in its translation, and change it to “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”. For example, look at the translation of Yousuf Ali. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Quran 4:11</a>) Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, <span style="color: #236fa1; background-color: #eccafa;"><strong>two or more</strong></span>, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. (<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Yusuf Ali, Saudi Revised Edition,1985</a>)</p>

<h2>May Allah KILL the Jews</h2>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2236">Sahih Bukhari, 2236</a>:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>English Translation by Mohsin Khan:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), in the year of the Conquest of Mecca, saying, "Allah and His Apostle made illegal the trade of alcohol, dead animals, pigs and idols." The people asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What about the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the hides; and people use it for lights?" He said, "No, it is illegal." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) further said, <strong>"May Allah <span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ff0000;">curse</span> the Jews</strong>, for Allah made the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the fat and sold it and ate its price."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p>Muhammad used the word Qatal (<strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ff0000;">قَاتَلَ</span></strong>), which if translated correctly means “<strong>kill</strong>”  (i.e. May Allah <strong>KILL</strong> the Jews), nevertheless, Muslim Translation distorted the exact words of Muhammad, and used instead "<strong>curse</strong>".</p>
<p>These words of "May Allah kill the Jews) is also found 4 more times in Sahih Bukhari, and the Muslim Translator distorted the translation at all these places ( <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:437">437</a>, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2223">2223</a>, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2224">2224</a>, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2236">2236 </a>and <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4633">4633</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Question: Why was the Muslim Translator forced to distort the translation here?</strong></p>
<p><strong> Answer: </strong> </p>
<p>During the Meccan period, Muslims were weak and they feared the wrath of the people of Mecca. </p>
<p>When the opponents mocked Muhammad and even physically tortured him too for his claim of prophethood, the question was raised why didn't the Mighty Allah helps his prophet, and defend him against the Kuffar? </p>
<p>Muhammad had no answer to this question. Thus he made an excuse that the verse of Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/21.107">21:107</a> had been revealed by Allah, where he (i.e. Muhammad) was mentioned as رحمة للعالمين  (i.e. Mercy for whole mankind and the universe), and thus he cannot pray for the destruction of his opponents.</p>
<p>There are many Ahadith too, where the same situation happened. For example, when Muhammad went to Ta'if, his opponents mocked and tortured him. Thereupon, Muhammad claimed that Allah sent the angel Jibrael to kill all the people of Ta'if, but since Muhammad is a MERCY for mankind, he asked Jibrael not to destroy them. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/42">Sahih Bukhari, 3231</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Muhammad said, while returning back from Ta'if after they rejected his claim of prophethood) ... So I departed, overwhelmed with excessive sorrow, and proceeded on, and could not relax till I found myself at Qarnath-Tha-alib where I lifted my head towards the sky to see a cloud shading me unexpectedly. I looked up <strong>and saw Gabriel in it</strong>. He called me saying, 'Allah has heard your people's saying to you, and what they have replied back to you,<strong> Allah has sent the Angel of the Mountains to you so that you may order him to do whatever you wish to these people</strong>.' The Angel of the Mountains called and greeted me, and then said, "O Muhammad! Order what you wish. If you like, <strong>I will let Al-Akh-Shabain (i.e. two mountains) fall on them</strong>." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "<strong>No (don't destroy them)</strong> but I hope that Allah will let them beget children who will worship Allah Alone, and will worship None besides Him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, today all the Muslims are brainwashed to believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prophet Muhammad was a MERCY for the whole of mankind,</li>
<li>And prophet Muhammad never prayed anything bad even for his worst enemies, but always prayed to Allah to have mercy upon them. </li>
</ul>
<p>But indeed all that was Muhammad's own drama of revelation, and thus it had human mistakes and contradictions, and Muhammad was himself wishing for the "destruction/killing" of Jews (later in Madina) in the above-mentioned hadith. That is why Muslims distorted the English translation of this hadith. </p>

<h2>Destroying anything similar to the Christian Cross (Non-Muslim phobia of Muhammad)</h2>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5952">Sahih Bukhari, 5952</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>حَدَّثَنَا مُعَاذُ بْنُ فَضَالَةَ، حَدَّثَنَا هِشَامٌ، عَنْ يَحْيَى، عَنْ عِمْرَانَ بْنِ حِطَّانَ، أَنَّ عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ حَدَّثَتْهُ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم لَمْ يَكُنْ يَتْرُكُ فِي بَيْتِهِ شَيْئًا فِيهِ تَصَالِيبُ إِلاَّ نَقَضَهُ‏.‏</p>
</blockquote>
<p>English Translation by Mohsin Khan:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha:<strong> I</strong> never used to leave in the Prophet (ﷺ) house anything carrying images or crosses but he obliterated it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p>Correct Translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: Prophet never used to leave in his house anything which was similar to crosses (like the ones who Christians have) but he obliterated it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>The question is, who brought those crosses into his house? Was it Mariyah (his concubine), or someone else? </p>
<p>Moreover, Muhammad was suffering from a non-Muslim phobia, and he opposed each and everything which could have resembled the non-Muslims. For example, he said to Muslims <a href="https://dorar.net/h/eea2c998df42faaa64eed0096e0a361a">وقرّوا عنانينكُم ، وقصّروا سبالكُم ، وخالفوا أهلَ الكتابِ</a>  (Translation: Grow your beards long and cut your moustache and oppose the people of book i.e. Jews and Christians and Zoroastrians).  </p>

<h2>Proving through distorted translation that 'Aisha was 16 years old when Muhammad married her</h2>
<p>Here is the distorted Hadith:</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">أَنَّ عَائِشَةَ، زَوْجَ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>قَالَتْ لَمْ أَعْقِلْ أَبَوَىَّ إِلاَّ وَهُمَا يَدِينَانِ الدِّينَ</strong></span>، وَلَمْ يَمُرَّ عَلَيْنَا يَوْمٌ إِلاَّ يَأْتِينَا فِيهِ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم طَرَفَىِ النَّهَارِ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيَّةً،</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(the wife of the Prophet) I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>age of puberty</strong></span>. Not a day passed but the Prophet (ﷺ) visited us, both in the mornings and evenings.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The hadith has Aisha addressing when his parents became Muslim.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is the line. قَالَتْ لَمْ أَعْقِلْ أَبَوَىَّ إِلاَّ وَهُمَا يَدِينَانِ الدِّينَ</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And according to the English translation, it's "My parents have been Muslim since I attained the <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">age of puberty</span>.</strong>"</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But an honest translation will be: "For as far as<span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong> I knew (i.e. I can remember)</strong></span>, my parents were always Muslims."</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The word أَعْقِلْ means thoughts or reasoning, but the translator, Muhsin Khan, has used the word 'puberty'. The meaning rather is simply that 'Aisha was aware that her parents were following Islam. A literal translation would be "I was not aware of my parents other than that the two of them both acknowledged the religion". The exact same Arabic phrase is translated correctly by the same translator in another narration of the same hadith (<a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-3/Book-37/Hadith-494/">link</a>).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The question is: "Why did Islamic apologists distort the translation?"</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The answer is that they want to prove when Abu Bakr accepted Islam, 'Aisha had already gained puberty. This would then mean that 'Aisha was not a minor girl of 6 years when Muhammad married her, but she was already a grown-up adult girl at the time of marriage. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Distortion to prove that 'Aisha was not a prepubescent girl at the time of intercourse, but already menstruating</h2>

<p>Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) married me when I was seven or six. When we came to Medina, some women came. according to Bishr's version: Umm Ruman came to me when I was swinging. They took me, made me prepared and decorated me. I was then brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he took up cohabitation with me when I was nine. She halted me at the door, <span style="color: #1200ff;"><strong>and I burst into laughter (Arabic: هِيهْ هِيهْ)</strong></span>. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Abu Dawud said: That is to say: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I </strong><strong>menstruated (Arabic:أَىْ تَنَفَّسَتْ)</strong></span>, and I was brought in a house, and there were some women of the Ansari in it.</span></p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Arabic words <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #1200ff;">هِيهْ هِيهْ</span></strong></span> don't mean "bursting into laughter", but according to Imam Abu Dawud they mean "I breathed".</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the Arabic words <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>أَىْ تَنَفَّسَتْ</strong></span> don't mean "I menstruated", but they mean "I breathed". </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://archive.org/details/AllInOne-Hadiths-EngArabicDarusalam_201407/All%20in%20One-Sunan%20Abu%20Dawud-Eng/page/n2738/mode/1up?q=4933">Darussalam English Translation of Sunan Abu Dawud</a> too translates this sentence as <em><strong>“ She made me stand at the door and I started to breathe deeply.” </strong></em>and there is absolutely no mention of "menstruation" or laughing in it. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The <a href="https://mohaddis.com/View/Abu-Daud/T2/4933">Urdu Translator</a> of Sunan Abu Dawud also translated it as "I breathed (i.e. taking a long cold breath)".</p>
<p>A similar hadith is present in <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3894">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3894</a>, which also makes it clear that it was about "Breathing". </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Please remember, it is always a huge <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>psychological burden</strong></span> for every 9 years old girl if she is told that she has been wed, and she has to leave the house of her parents, and go to the house of another total stranger person (who is above 50 years old), and live and to indulge in sexual activities with him. <strong>Every SINGLE</strong> 9-year-old girl will by nature automatically protest against it.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just look at this video of a 9-year-old Afghan girl who is crying bitterly and protesting and doesn't want to leave with her husband (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/telgq4/prophet_muhammad_married_a_6_yo_aisha_when_he_was/">Video Link</a>).</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Alone, telling a 9-year-old girl what sex is, brings a huge psychological pressure on her. But Islam not only gives this shock to little girls about sex, but also compels them to leave the house of their parents and siblings and friends, go with a stranger in his house, and engage in sexual activities with him, even if he is a 50-year-old man. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Watching football matches being Haram for women</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islamists discourage/forbid women from watching football matches and especially going to stadiums to watch them (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/146844/is-it-permissible-to-watch-football-soccer-games-on-television">Fatwa</a>). </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But the problem for them was, 'Aisha herself watched Ethiopians playing in the courtyard of the mosque.  </p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">4894. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Abyssinians were playing with their spears and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, acted as a screen for me while I was looking. I continued to look until I was the one to leave. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">So estimate how long a young girl is eager for amusement</span>.</strong>" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230508100912/https://bewley.virtualave.net/bukhari35.html">Translated by 'Aisha Bewley</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But Islamists had to forbid it for women. So, they did a Tehrif (Distortion) in the translation and showed only young girls (who have not reached puberty) are allowed to watch men playing games. Thus, Mohsin Khan (A Salafi Translator of Sahih Bukhari) made the following Tehrif in the translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Sahih Bukhari, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5236">5236</a>:</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Prophet (ﷺ) was screening me with his Rida' (garment covering the upper part of the body) while I was looking at the Ethiopians who were playing in the courtyard of the mosque. (I continued watching) till I was satisfied. So you may deduce from this event <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">how a little girl (who has not reached the age of puberty)</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">who is eager to enjoy amusement <span style="color: #ff0000;">should be treated in this respect</span></span></strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The translation of 'Aisha Bewley is correct, and there is no mention of reaching puberty or not in the original Arabic Text. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span>Revelation caused SHIVERING, or revelation caused SNORING?</h2>
<p>Instilling FEAR and DREAD in the hearts of their followers is the most effective weapon used by those who claim to be in contact with gods, deities, and the spiritual world. Muhammad used the same tactics at many places, including how revelation comes to him. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2">Sahih Bukhari, 2</a>:</strong></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated 'Aisha:  Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah's Messenger "O Allah's Messenger! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?" Allah's Messenger replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says." 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the Prophet being inspired divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead.<strong><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2114"></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4738">Sunan Abu Dawood, 4738</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) reported the Messenger of Allah as saying: "When Allah, the exalted, speaks to send revelation, the inhabitants of heaven hear the clanging of a bell from the heavens like a chain being dragged across a rock, and they swoon (faint). They continue to remain like that until Jibril comes to them. When he comes to them, they recover and say: 'O Jibril, what did your Lord say?' He would say: 'The truth,' and they would say: 'The truth, the truth.'"</div>

<p>However, a Direct Witness caught Muhammad to be SLEEPING and SNORING during the revelation:</p>
<p><span><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1789">Sahih al-Bukhari, The Book of Umra (Translated by Aisha Bewley)</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p><span>1697. Safwan ibn Ya'la ibn Umayya related from his father, "While the Prophet, may Allah bless him and <i>grant</i> him peace, was at al-Ji'rana with some of his Companions, a man came to him wearing a cloak which had traces of khaluq-perfume (or he said, 'yellowness') on it and said, 'What do you order me to do in my <i>'umra</i>?' Revelation came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he was shaded by a cloth. I had been wanting to see the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">revelation</span></strong> was descending on him. 'Umar said, 'Come on, would you like to see the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when Allah is sending down the <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>revelation</strong></span> on him?' I said, 'Yes.' So he lifted a corner of the cloth and I looked at him and <strong>he was <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">snoring</span>. (I think he said, 'Snoring like a young camel.')</strong> . When the state left him, he said, 'Where is the man who asked about<i> 'umra</i>? Take off your cloak, wash off the trace of <i>khaluq</i> from yourself and then wash away the yellowness. Do the same in your<i> 'umra</i> as you do in your hajj.'"</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tehrif (Distortion) Case:</strong></span></p>
<p>However, Islamic apologists have distorted the translation of this hadith by using the word "<strong>inspiration</strong>" instead of "<strong>revelation</strong>." For example, see the translation of this<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1789"> Hadith at Sunnah.com</a>. The Arabic word used here is "الْوَحْىُ," which means "revelation," not "inspiration."</p>
<p>They resort to these deceptive tactics to conceal this Islamic contradiction (of Shivering vs. Snoring) from innocent people.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Does Halal Slaughter produce better Meat Quality?</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islam-general/94-does-halal-slaughter-produce-better-meat-quality</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islam-general/94-does-halal-slaughter-produce-better-meat-quality</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Summary:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Today Islamic preachers claim the Halal slaughter (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhabihah">Dhabihah  ذبح</a>) method is less painful as compared to other methods, and it produces better meat quality which lasts long as all blood is drained. </li>
<li>And we reply that for sure, the method of stunning animals before slaughter is more painless as compared to the Halal "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhabihah">Dhabihah  ذبح</a>" slaughter method. </li>
<li>And even the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhabihah">Dhabihah</a>" method (i.e. to slit the veins in the throat of an animal) was not invented by Islam/Judaism, but it was invented thousands of years before Judaism by "hunters". Therefore, even if we assume this method makes meat quality better, then the credit goes to those hunters, and not to Islam/Judaism. </li>
<li>Moreover, neither Muhammad nor Allah claimed that the wisdom behind halal meat lies in its superior health benefits.</li>
<li>But the main intention behind "Dhabihah" was the "<strong>Flowing of the Blood</strong> <strong>of animals</strong>" as a sacrifice ritual, while it makes Allah happy. It was a thousands of years old custom in many civilizations where the blood of animals was flown in sacrifice to make gods/idols happy. Therefore, Muhammad was also only interested in the flowing of blood in the name of Allah.</li>
<li>And if Allah (i.e. Muhammad) intended for healthy meat, why didn't then he order to drain the blood of "<strong>fish</strong>" by slaughtering it? Yes, a fish can also be slaughtered in a way to drain all blood. This method is known as IKEJIME. Fish meat spoils very quickly as compared to the meat of land animals. Thus, if Allah really intended for healthy meat without spoilage, then he should have told the method of IKEJIME slaughter to Muslims (or Jews/Christians). The ignorance from the IKEJIME method becomes proof that there exists no all-knowing Allah in the heavens. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Islamic claim: Less pain in the Halal method and the meat quality is better</h2>
<p>Today, Muslim preachers widely promote the idea that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientific studies indicate that blood remaining in meat deteriorates quickly and becomes prone to contamination. Consequently, meat without blood does not spoil as quickly, remains tender, and exhibits better quality. Similarly, during halal slaughter, the blood supply to the brain is cut off, resulting in the animal feeling no pain after 3 to 5 seconds. Therefore, this aspect validates the authenticity of Islam and serves as proof of Islam's miraculous nature and the existence of Allah (<a href="https://www.academia.edu/26605440/Influence_of_Halal_and_Non-Halal_Slaughtering_on_the_Quality_Characteristics_of_Broiler_Chicken_Burger">Scientific Study 1</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Science-of-meat/articleshow/11672654.cms">Times of India</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reply:</strong></p>
<p>Islamic preachers are wrong and there is no doubt that stunning animals cause less pain as compared to the Halal method. </p>
<ul>
<li>The stunning method causes <strong>ZERO Second</strong> pain. This is the most humane method. Afterwards, the cut can be made, and the animal can be vertically hung with the neck on the downside to drain the blood. </li>
<li>As compared to zero second pain in the stunning method, a large cut made across the neck of awake animals (like in the Halal method) would "result in significant pain and distress". They would be in this pain until they passed out. It would take around 5 to 7 seconds for sheep and 22 to 40 seconds for adult cattle to pass out from the cut (<a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/religiousslaughter">link</a>).</li>
<li>While the Islamic method of slaughtering camels (i.e. Nahar نحر) takes even much longer time i.e. up to a few minutes of extreme pain and distress. It is ridiculous to claim that Nahar slaughter causes less pain to camels as compared to the almost zero second stunning method. </li>
</ul>
<p>Jews didn't slaughter camels as they were not allowed to eat camel meat. </p>
<p>Camels are slaughtered differently than cattle. It is known as 'Nahr نحر'. In this method, the person slaughtering the camel must thrust a knife into the hollow area between the camel’s neck and chest (cutting the arteries coming out of the heart). This was the method, which was used by pre-Islamic Arabs for killing a camel, and Muhammad copied this practice from them. He only added the taking of the name of Allah at the time of thrusting the knife. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://veganmuslims.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/killing-768x534.jpg"></p>
<p>Moreover, Islamic preachers also employ some tactics to prove the traditional halal slaughter method to be better than the stunning method. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>They claim if stunning is not done properly, then it will cause more pain to animals. But it is similar, if Halal slaughter is not done properly, then the animal will suffer pain for a much longer. Therefore, the solution is to make better equipment for stunning and not to revert to the painful Halal slaughter method. </li>
<li>They also claim that the traditional Halal slaughter causes more blood loss as compared to the stunning and then cutting the veins method while the heart stops beating in the stunning method. But they are wrong again, as there is no difference in the blood loss in both methods (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279989452_A_comparison_of_blood_loss_during_the_Halal_slaughter_of_lambs_following_Traditional_Religious_Slaughter_without_stunning_Electric_Head-Only_Stunning_and_Post-Cut_Electric_Head-Only_Stunning">Scientific Study</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Firstly: The method of slaughtering by cutting the blood veins in the throat was actually invented by hunters</h2>
<p>Therefore, the first question arises: Why do Muslims associate this method with Allah?</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago, hunters devised this method for a practical reason. For techniques involving a heavy blow or "jhatka," a substantial heavy cleaver was necessary to separate the head from the body. However, it was impractical for hunters to carry such heavy cleavers during hunting (as they had to run many miles to find and chase an animal).</p>
<p>Even up until seven thousand years ago (prior to the discovery of iron and copper), people did not possess knives and would use sharp stones or bones for animal slaughter. Since it was not possible to completely sever the head from the body using stones or bones, all hunters resorted to cutting the veins in the animal's throat. Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age">Iron Age</a> started only 3,300 years ago. There existed no iron knives before that. Similarly, the Bronze Age started only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age">5,300</a> years ago. </p>
<p>Three thousand years ago, Jews made this hunting method kosher by merely mentioning the name of their God, and Muslims, following their example, termed it halal slaughter.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if we assume that cutting the blood vessels in the neck improves the quality of meat, it is not a credit to Islam/Judaism; rather, the entire credit goes to ancient hunters, and it is their miracle. Muslims should acknowledge those ancient hunters as the "Knower of the Unseen."</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Secondly: The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Intention</span> behind "Dhabihah" was the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Flowing of the Blood of Animals</span>" as a sacrifice ritual to make Allah Happy</h2>
<p>First of all, it is a <strong>CHALLENGE</strong> to Islamic preachers to bring a single Quranic verse or Hadith of Muhammad which claims that draining blood makes meath healthy. They will fail as there is none. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Importance of "flowing of the blood" as a "symbolic sign" for Muhammad as he followed the old Ignorant Arabic traditions:</strong></span></p>
<p>The flowing of blood was a "symbolic sign" (just like saying Bismillah at the time of slaughter).  </p>
<p>This verse indicates the mentality about the flowing of the blood:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/22.37">22:37</a>:</p>
<p>Their meat will not reach Allah, <strong>nor will their blood</strong>, but what reaches Him is piety from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could also see this love affair of Muhammad with the flowing of blood in the following tradition:</p>
<p>Sunan Tarmidhi, Book of Sacrifice (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200722010023/http://web.archive.org/web/20160910144830/http://www.hadithurdu.com/05/5-1-1543/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sayyidah Ayshah (RA) narrated that Allahs Messenger said, “Of the deeds a man does on the day of sacrifice<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong> the dearest to Allah is the flow of blood (during sacrifice)</strong></span>. It will come on the day of Resurrection with its horns and its hair and its hoofs. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Indeed, blood will be accepted by Allah at once</strong></span> even before it falls on the ground. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>So, please yourselves with this flowing of blood</strong></span>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1243a">Sahih Muslim, Book of Pilgrimage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">قَالَ صَلَّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم الظُّهْرَ بِذِي الْحُلَيْفَةِ ثُمَّ دَعَا بِنَاقَتِهِ فَأَشْعَرَهَا فِي صَفْحَةِ سَنَامِهَا الأَيْمَنِ وَسَلَتَ الدَّمَ وَقَلَّدَهَا نَعْلَيْنِ ثُمَّ رَكِبَ رَاحِلَتَهُ فَلَمَّا اسْتَوَتْ بِهِ عَلَى الْبَيْدَاءِ أَهَلَّ بِالْحَجِّ ‏.‏<br>Ibn 'Abbas reported that Allah's Messenger observed the Zuhr prayer at Dhu'l-Hulaifa; then called for his she-camel and <em><strong>marked it (made a cut) on the right side of its bump, <span style="color: #ff0000;">removed the blood from it,</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">and tied two sandals around its neck (as garland)</span>. </strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it not an act of ignorance to adorn animals with strings of shoes? Why would Allah, the creator of not just the earth but the entire universe, require animals for sacrifice to be decorated with footwear?</p>
<p>Furthermore, what kind of intelligence is displayed by harming a living creature and considering it a symbolic act? Why subject animals to the humiliation of wearing shoe necklaces and causing them harm?</p>
<p>This practice was so lacking in wisdom that today many Muslims are abandoning it, despite it being considered an established "Sunnah of the Prophet."</p>
<p>Even Abu Hanifa, a renowned Islamic scholar, rejected this practice of Muhammad due to its cruelty. He refused to follow this Sunnah and claimed it to be a MUTILATION (مثلة) of animals.</p>

<blockquote class="western">عَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَلَّدَ نَعْلَيْنِ وَأَشْعَرَ الْهَدْىَ فِي الشِّقِّ الأَيْمَنِ بِذِي الْحُلَيْفَةِ وَأَمَاطَ عَنْهُ الدَّمَ ‏. … كنا عند وكيع فقال لرجل عنده ممن ينظر في الرأي أشعر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ويقول أبو حنيفة هو مثلة قال الرجل فإنه قد روي عن إبراهيم النخعي أنه قال الإشعار مثلة قال فرأيت وكيعا غضب غضبا شديدا وقال أقول لك قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وتقول قال إبراهيم ما أحقك بأن تحبس ثم لا تخرج حتى تنزع عن قولك هذا</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">Ibn Abbas narrated: "The Prophet garlanded two sandals and marked the Hadi (i.e. camel) on the right side (i.e. by cutting its hump) at Dhul-Hulaifah, and removed the blood from it." … Imam Wak’i told that the Prophet of Allah did al-Isha’ar (i.e. making a cut in the hump of camel), <b>but Imam Abu Hanifa said that it was </b><b>mutilation</b><b> (</b><span lang="ur-PK"><b>مثلة</b></span><b>) of an animal's body</b>. One man said that Imam Ibrahim Nakhi’i also called al-Isha’ar to be mutilation. Upon hearing that, Wak’i became angry and said: “I am telling you the Sunnah of the holy prophet, but you tell me what Ibrahim Naki’i said. I deem it permissible to imprison you and not set you free till you abandon telling people (about the saying of Ibrahim Nakhi’i i.e. it is mutilation of an animal).</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western"><strong>Grade</strong>: <strong>Sahih</strong> (Authentic) Darussalam.</blockquote>
<p>And the following tradition also proves that Allah (i.e. Muhammad) did not intend to flow <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> the blood, but only <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SOME</strong></span> blood was enough as it was only symbolic. </p>
<p>Sunan Tirmidhi (<a href="https://dorar.net/h/iCwMVywy?alts=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abu al-Ushara' reported on the authority of his father: He asked: Apostle of Allah, is the slaughtering to be done <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>only in the upper part of the breast and the throat</strong></span>? The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) replied: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you pierced its thigh (i.e. causing less blood to flow), it would serve you</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Grade: Sahih (<strong class="px-2"><a class="color-3d6b13" href="https://dorar.net/h/1u8LHj3J?alts=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">الصحيح البديل</a></strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again this proves that Muhammad's intention was not to maximise the drainage of blood.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Thirdly: Why then Allah didn't order to drain the blood of Fish in IKEJIME like slaughter?</strong></h2>
<p>If removing blood from land animals through slaughter to enhance the quality of meat is considered a miracle from Allah, then compromising the quality of fish meat and subjecting fish to extreme pain by not removing its blood through the Ikejime method would also be Allah's fault.</p>
<p>It was the Japanese who developed the humane method of Ikejime for slaughtering fish, which minimizes the pain the fish experiences and effectively removes all blood, resulting in improved meat quality. Fish meat remains fresh for longer periods as well.</p>
<p>So, the question is, if Allah exists and he is All-Knowing, why didn't he then tell the method of Ikejime to Muhammad (or other prophets before him)?</p>
<p>Muslim preachers will never answer this question. While the reason is simple, i.e. Japanese invented this method of Ikejime only 200 years ago. Since the Jews and the ancient Arabs didn't practice this method of Ikejime, thus Muhammad was also unable to copy them and introduced it in Islam.</p>
<p>The next question is, if Muslims believe that Allah is truly the Knower of the unseen and introduced the halal slaughter method to minimize animal suffering and produce healthy meat, then why doesn't Allah take responsibility for compromising the quality of fish meat and subjecting fish to agonizing pain for several minutes by suffocating it to death?</p>
<p>It is certain that Muslims will never answer this question too.</p>
<p>Watch this video to see the Ikejime method for fish slaughter. Today, top fish restaurants in Japan and Europe exclusively use fish slaughtered through the Ikejime method because it enhances the taste of the fish meat. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TS4AM9mPX-8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Pigs are also slaughtered in the Halal way (just like Camels, except the name of Allah)</h2>
<p>Interestingly, a similar method is employed in the West for slaughtering pigs. Rather than using a cleaver to cut the whole neck of a pig in one blow (as it is very fat), a method similar to Islamic slaughter is employed, where an incision is made near the heart. This reduces the pig's discomfort as the blood supply to the brain is immediately interrupted. Subsequently, the pig is hung upside down so that all the blood drains out. From this perspective, the pig is slaughtered exactly in the Islamic method, and due to the upside-down position, it has less blood in its meat compared to a traditional Islamic slaughter.</p>
<p>For sure Allah didn't teach non-Muslims to slaughter pigs in this intelligent way, but they found it out on their own. Therefore, are Muslims now going to declare it a miracle of non-Muslims too, and accept that they also have a knowledge of the Unseen alongside Allah?</p>

			<title>Breastfeeding Adults: Why was Muhammad forced to allow it? </title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islam-general/314-breastfeeding-adults-why-was-muhammad-forced-to-allow-it</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId810532"></a><strong>Summary:</strong></h2>
<p>Islamic apologists claim that breastfeeding adults is not allowed. However, without "breastfeeding," they cannot manage many practical situations in day-to-day life, such as living in a joint family system or dealing with adopted children. As a result, they often neglect Sharia and indulge in sin by continuing to live in joint family systems. The same applies to adopted children who are not expelled from their homes upon reaching adulthood.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a significant portion of Ahadith has survived only due to adult breastfeeding. Without it, these Ahadith might have been lost, as there were hardly any other practical means of collecting them.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId815943"></a><strong>Question: Why did Muhammad SMILE?</strong></h2>
<p>Sahla, a female companion of Muhammad, had an adoptive son named Salim. When Salim became an adult, Sahla's husband was uncomfortable with him entering the house because Salim was considered non-Mahram to his adoptive mother. Sahla approached the Prophet Muhammad for guidance. He suggested that Sahla should nurse adult Salim (who already had a beard), so that he could become a Mahram to her adoptive mother through nursing.</p>
<p>Muslim scholars have differing opinions on whether Sahla expressed her milk into a cup and then fed it to Salim or whether the nursing took place directly from the breasts. While there is no definitive proof that the milk was collected in a cup, indications suggest that the nursing occurred directly from the breast.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1453a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1453a</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Sahla bint Suhail came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, I see on the face of Abu Hudhaifa (signs of disgust) on entering of Salim (who is an ally) into (our house), whereupon Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) said: <em><strong>Suckle him</strong></em>. She said: How can I suckle him as he is a grown-up man? Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) <em><strong>SMILED</strong></em> and said: I already know that he is a young man ... and in the narration of Ibn 'Umar (the words are): Allah's Messenger <em><strong>LAUGHED</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This smile indicates that the milk was indeed drunk directly from the breasts. Sahla was concerned and hesitant about this, but Muhammad found the situation amusing and laughed.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId449920"></a><strong>Contradiction: Breastfeeding is from hunger:</strong></h2>
<p>According to Islamic tradition, the Prophet Muhammad instructed Sahla to breastfeed Salim in order to establish a mahram relationship, without specifying any conditions related to hunger.  </p>
<p>However, in his own "personal case" Muhammad denied any such establishment of Mahram relationship, and put the condition of "hunger" with it:</p>
<p><strong>Sunan An-Nasa’i 3314:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Aisha: The Messenger of Allah entered upon me and there was a man sitting with me. He got upset about that, and I saw the anger in his face. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, he is my brother through breastfeeding.” He said, “Be careful who you count as your brothers, for breastfeeding is from hunger.” <br>Hadith Grade:<br>(<a href="https://archive.org/stream/WAQssnisaa/ssnisaa2#page/n438/mode/1up">Sahih</a>) according to al-Albani</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a logical perspective too, it is unlikely that an adult could satiate their hunger by consuming breast milk. This means, Sahla was not able to satiate the hunger of grown-up Salim through breastfeeding, but Muhammad still made him her Mahram through breastmilking.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId740857"></a><strong>The issue of "Abdult's Breastfeeding" arose only due to another Islamic issue of "No BOND between foster mother and adoptive son":</strong></h2>
<p>Sahla was the foster mother, while Salim was her adoptive child. Poor Sahla had to undergo the shameful act of breastfeeding him ONLY while Muhammad earlier denied any BOND between foster mother and adoptive children. The reason behind this denial was the desire of Muhammad for the wife of his adopted son. He became infatuated with his daughter-in-law upon seeing her in a semi-naked state and used revelations to justify denying any bond between adopted children and their foster parents. Consequently, he made it permissible for him to marry his daughter-in-law. For further details on this matter, you can refer to the article titled:  </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/54-role-of-revelation-in-muhammad-s-journey-from-4-marriages-to-9-marriages">Role of REVELATION in Muhammad's journey from 4 marriages to 9 marriages </a></li>
</ul>
<p>The role of a foster parent is esteemed higher than that of a biological parent, as it is not about who gave birth to a child but rather about who fosters, loves, and cares for them. A child instinctively seeks comfort and affection from the person who nurtures and supports them.</p>
<p>The significance of fostering can even be observed in the animal kingdom. For instance, if you place the eggs of a hen under a duck, the chicks hatched from those eggs will still consider the duck as their mother, as they witness her caring for them. This bond is formed despite the lack of a biological connection.</p>
<p>Indeed, the status of a foster parent surpasses that of a biological parent. When a foster mother or father lovingly raises a child, a <strong>natural parent-child bond</strong> develops between them.</p>
<p>Throughout history, every society has recognized and accepted the powerful bond between an adopted child and their foster parents. This bond is also supported by numerous experiments and acknowledged by psychiatrists worldwide.</p>
<p>Islam is the only religion in the entire world, which denies this natural bond between foster mother and the adopted child. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId957220"></a><strong>Contradiction: An adult male slave becomes Mahram to all the wives/daughters of the owner as soon as he is bought from the market:</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike an adopted son, an adult male slave becomes Mahram to all the wives and daughters of the owner as soon as he is purchased from the slave market. Instantly, he gains the privilege to stay alone with the owner's wife or daughter under one roof without any need for her to observe Hijab or hide her adornments (Zinah) from him.</p>
<p>Surah Nur, Verse <a href="https://quranx.com/24.31">24:31</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And say to the believing women (that) they should lower [of] their gaze and they should guard their chastity, and not (to) display their adornment except what is apparent of it. And let them draw their head covers over their bosoms, and not (to) display their adornment <strong>except to their</strong> husbands, or their fathers or fathers (of) their husbands or their sons or sons (of) their husbands or their brothers or sons (of) their brothers or sons (of) their sisters, or their women or <em><strong>what possess their right hands (i.e. slaves) </strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also read the following <em>hadith</em>, where Muhammad was telling his daughter Fatima that she didn't need to do Hijab from the male slave.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4106">Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 4106</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) brought Fatimah a slave which he donated to her. Fatimah wore a garment which, when she covered her head, did not reach her feet, and when she covered her feet by it, that garment did not reach her head. When the Prophet (ﷺ) saw her struggle, he said: <strong><em>There is no harm to you: Here is only your father and slave</em></strong>.<br><strong>Grade</strong>: <strong><em>Sahih</em></strong> (Albani)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, Islam forbids an adopted son from being alone with his mother, whom he has been raised by and loved as his own since childhood.However, on the other hand, Islam permits an adult male slave to be Mahram to all the wives and daughters of his owner immediately after he is bought from the slave market. He can enter the house, he can stay alone with the owner's wife or daughter in the same house, without the need for her to observe Hijab or hide her adornments (Zinah) from him.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId210091"></a><strong>Breastfeeding a grown-up male will not create a mother-son bond, but only the bond of LUST and SEX:</strong></h2>
<p>The human rationale makes it evident that Muhammad's ruling is flawed and unreasonable, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a woman breastfed a grown-up male man with a moustache and beard, then a mother-son bond will not develop, but only the bond of LUST and SEX can develop. </li>
<li>While it is possible for a relationship of respect to exist between a woman and a grown-up man, breastfeeding would be the most inappropriate method to achieve this purpose. Instead, natural relationships, like a sister/mother bond, can form between individuals through care and nurturing without the need for such actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, in many Muslim families living in a joint family system in countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, there is a relationship of respect between a man and the wife of his elder brother, showcasing that this kind of bond can develop without resorting to breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Moreover, breastfeeding for 5 times does not change the DNA (i.e. no BOND is developed through DNA too). Therefore, becoming Mahram through 5 times breastfeeding has absolutely no logic behind it, but Muhammad was only following ancient tradition of his Arab culture, where breastfeeding was considered as a form of becoming Mahram. </p>
<p>The BOND is created only through fostering, loving and taking care, which Islam denied. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId970381"></a><strong>Consequence of denying the sacred BOND between foster father and adopted daughter:</strong></h2>
<p>According to human nature, every minor child girl needs the selfless love and care of a father.</p>
<p>But what Muhammad did, is as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad first destroyed the sacred bond between the adopted child and the parents and allowed marriage between them. </li>
<li>By doing so, Islam made an adopted daughter <strong>a sex object</strong> in the eyes of the foster father (and also foster brothers) right from the very first day. </li>
</ul>
<p>An adopted son would not be able to have strength to do sex till the age of 13-14 years and thus, no danger for his foster mother (in the eyes of Islam). Thus, Islam allows an adoptive son to remain in the house till he becomes and adult, and only after that he will be expelled from the house (due to fear of indulging in sex with his foster mother). </p>
<p>But what about adopted daughter?</p>
<p>If Islamic Shaitan (Devil) comes when adult man and woman are alone, then the same Islamic Shaitan is also capable of coming when foster father will be alone with his adopted minor daughter, while there exist no "sacred bond" in the mind of Muslim foster father. </p>
<p>Moreover, the problem with Islam is DOUBLE fold where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad not only denied any sacred bond between a foster father and the adopted daughter</li>
<li>But Muhammad also allowed the foster father to FORCEFULLY take minor adoptive daughter into his NIKAH (even without her consent). No Islamic court can prevent a foster father from doing it, as it is Halal Allah.</li>
</ul>
<p>This happened practically during the days of Muhammad himself when his companions started taking minor adopted daughters into their NIKAH either for their beauty or for their wealth. </p>
<p>The largest Islamic website IslamQA writes (<a href="https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This verse (i.e. Quran 4:3) proves it’s allowed (for a foster father) to marry an orphan. <strong>And an orphan cannot be an adult</strong>. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, "It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. ”</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: “<strong>This shows it’s allowed (for a foster father) to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans.</strong>”</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId831740"></a><strong>Islamist's Excuse: Breastfeeding an Adult is not allowed and The Prophet allowed it ONLY to Sahla as an Exception:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Our Response:</strong> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Islamic Scholars differ among themselves</span></p>
<p>Islamic Scholars differ among themselves and some of them allow adult breastfeeding (<a href="https://theislamissue.wordpress.com/2019/02/15/breastfeeding-adults-in-islam/">Link</a>). It is similar as wives of Muhammad (the mothers of Muslims) who also differed among themselves, and 'Aisha used to sent adult men to her nieces to breastfed them (<a href="https://archive.org/details/SunanAbuDawudVol.111160EnglishArabic/Sunan%20Abu%20Dawud%20Vol.%202%20-%201161-2174%20English%20Arabic/page/n506/mode/1up?view=theater">Sunan Abu Dawud, 2061, Sahih</a>). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Even the case of Sahla is ENOUGH</span> </p>
<p>Even if it was ONLY an exception in the case of Sahla, it is ENOUGH for us to determine that Islam is false. No mother should suffer such humiliation to prove mother-child bond. This bond is developed through raising and taking care and loving the child. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: The hardships that Islamic Ruling brings to Humanity</span></p>
<p>If you wish to understand the severity of this Islamic ruling, take a look at this incident (<a href="https://www.banuri.edu.pk/readquestion/mun-bole-betay-se-parde-ka-hukum/01-01-2010">link</a>), where a Muslim mother found herself in tears, refusing to be separated from her adopted son when he reached the age of 12-13 years. However, the relatives insisted on forcibly separating them, and the Muslim Mufti supported their decision, citing it as Allah's command in Islam. According to the reasoning, Allah fears that allowing both Na-Mahrams (the mother and her 12-14 years old adopted son) to stay together under one roof may lead to the Fitna of fornication.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: Education is Enough to have a Bond of Respect </span></p>
<p>"Education" of being descent humans is enough to make a relationship of "respect" between a woman and man. Breastfeeding an adult is the most inappropriate method to develop this relationship of respect. Again, look at those Muslim families living in a joint family system in countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, there is a relationship of respect between a man and the wife of his elder brother, showcasing that this kind of bond can develop without resorting to breastfeeding.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>: Islam does not have the Ability to solve practical problems of our lives</span></p>
<p>Even if we assume that adult breastfeeding is not permissible in Islam, this suggests that Islam struggles to address various practical situations in our lives. Scenarios like that of Sahla and Salim (i.e., a foster mother and adopted child) will continue to arise (along with joint family system). If adult breastfeeding is not allowed, it would only lead to the breaking up of families. Islam would not only separate the foster mother from her adopted orphan son but also remove him from the entire family, including foster sisters. This would effectively orphan the poor child a second time. Moreover, the foster mother would be left grieving and childless for the rest of her life. This is one of the gravest forms of oppression that Islam imposes on humanity.</p>
<p>Similarly, millions of Muslim families in Indian sub-continent live in joint family system. They know that that they are indulging in HARAM and committing sin by doing it, but Islamic Sharia presents no other practical solution. Poor families especially suffer due to it. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sixthly</strong>: A significal portion of Ahadith survived only due to adult's breastfeeding</span></p>
<p>'Aisha narrated several thousand Ahadith of Muhammad, while all of Muhammad's other eight wives combined narrated only a few hundred. Some of them narrated zero Ahadith because they had no male relatives and did not allow non-Mahram men to visit them.</p>
<p>However, 'Aisha sent non-Mahram (i.e., not related) collectors of Ahadith to her nieces, who breastfed them, thereby making them Mahram to 'Aisha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2061">Sunan Abi Dawud 2061</a>:</p>
<p>... A’ishah used to ask the daughters of her sisters and the daughters of her brethren to give him breast feed five times, whom A’ishah wanted to see and who wanted to visit her. Though he might be of age; he then visited her. But Umm Salamah and all other wives of the Prophet refused to allow anyone to visit them on the basis of such breast feeding unless one was given breast feed during infancy. They told A’ishah: “by Allah we do not know whether that was a special concession granted by the Prophet to Salim exclusive of the people.<br>Grade: (<a href="https://archive.org/stream/WAQssunnd/ssunnd1#page/n576/mode/1up">Sahih</a>) Al-albani</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId157582"></a><strong>Islamic System: Woman's Breasts were exposed in Front of Mahram Men (i.e., Father, Brother, Son, Nephews, Uncles, etc.)</strong></h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There existed (and still exist) many cultures in the world, where women didn't cover their breasts in public. In pre-Islamic Arab culture too, women didn't use any upper garment to  cover their breasts. Later, Muhammad only ordered free Muslim women to put the Jilbab (a sheet of garment) on their heads, and it covered their whole body including their breasts. But Muhammad prohibited slave women from wearing the Jilbab and kept their breast naked in public. Please read our article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mod-articles-category-title" href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women/37-women-and-hijab/11-islam-prohibited-slave-women-from-wearing-the-hijab-or-even-covering-their-naked-breasts-in-public">Islam Prohibited Slave Women from wearing the Hijab or even Covering Their Naked Breasts in Public</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As far as free Muslim women are concerned, then they have to take the Jilbab only in public, but there was no Jilbab inside their homes, in front of their Mahram men (father, son, uncles, nephews, breastfed milk brothers etc.). Thus, according to Fatwas of Muslim Scholars, woman's 'Awarah (nakedness) in front of their Mahram men is only from their navel to the knees. </p>
<p>Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani is considered as an ultimate Hadith Master by Muslims. He wrote the commentary of Sahih Bukhari. And under the commentary of this Hadith, he wrote (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220923133859/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;idfrom=490&amp;idto=495&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=178">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p> قال القاضي عياض : ظاهره أنهما رأيا عملها في رأسها وأعالي جسدها مما يحل نظره للمحرم ; لأنها خالة أبي سلمة من الرضاع أرضعته أختها أم كلثوم وإنما سترت أسافل بدنها مما لا يحل للمحرم النظر إليه </p>
<p>Qadi Ayad said:<strong> It is apparent that they could see her actions from her head and the top half of her body, because they were allowed to do as she was a milk-aunt to Abu Salamah and his brother from her sister Umm Kulthum. As for the lower part of her body, this was covered.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more details and fatwas, please read this detailed article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-general/156-a-muslim-woman-can-expose-her-naked-breasts-in-front-of-mahram-men-i-e-,-father,-brother,-son,-nephews,-uncles,-etc">A Muslim Woman can expose her Naked Breasts in Front of Mahram Men</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, Salim most probably saw Sahla with exposed breasts before becoming an adult, and also saw her with exposed breasts after becoming an adult. </p>

			<title>Are Islamic countries really ahead in watching Porn Movies?</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It is often claimed that the Islamic system of the Hijab and gender-based segregation causes extreme sexual frustration among Muslim men. That is why Muslim countries are ahead in watching porn films on the internet.</p>
<p>However, Islamic preachers deny it. They call it only false propaganda against Islam and Muslims. And they come up with this argument:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2022-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Pornhub's official statistics for the top 20 countries in 2020.</a> show that the only Islamic country Egypt just barely managed to enter the top 20s last year for the first time. The USA is at #1 far outpacing the other countries on the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>It is due to the reason while Islamic countries have already banned porn websites. Therefore, Muslims in these Islamic countries reach these porn websites only through VPN, where their IP address is changed from their original Islamic country to a non-Muslim country.</p>
<p>Here is a report by <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.bbc.com/urdu/interactivity/debate/story/2006/01/060116_reba_diary1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BBC Urdu</a> (from the year 2006) that 45% of Internet traffic from Pakistan went to porn websites daily. <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Google Trends</a> also showed that Islamic countries were at the top for searching for different types of porn films. </p>
<p>After 2010, almost all Islamic countries started banning access to porn websites. After the ban, the trend didn't stop, and people in Islamic countries started using VPNs to watch porn films, but it became impossible to calculate the data on the basis of the IP addresses of Islamic countries. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Google Trends</a> show that Islamic countries (still today) are at the top for searching porn-related searches. </p>
<p>For example, Pakistani Muslim men have been at the top of the list for the last 2 decades in search of incest terms like:</p>

<h2>Logical Arguments for Extreme Sexual Frustration in Islamic Societies</h2>
<p>Muslim men often experience great frustration due to the restrictions imposed on natural interactions between men and women in the name of Hijab and Islamic modesty.</p>
<p><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.</strong></p>
<p>That is why, even girls with Hijab are still harassed and molested in Islamic countries. </p>
<h2>The hijab didn't stop Muhammad from becoming sexually aroused</h2>
<p>Mohammad once called a presumably fully clothed woman in Medina a devil for just existing and became sexually aroused after seeing her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1403a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sahih Muslim, 1403a</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p>Jabir reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw a woman, and so he came to his wife, Zainab, as she was tanning a leather and had sexual intercourse with her. He then went to his Companions and told them: The woman advances and retires in the shape of a devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please think about it: Why did the Hijab fail to make Muhammad safe from being sexually aroused? </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Companions of Muhammad were unable to abstain from illegal sex for only 30 nights of Ramadan and they sinned. How can Muslim youth avoid sinning until they are 30 years old (until they get married)?</h2>
<p>Firstly, Muhammad told Muslims that Allah made sex with wives Haram during the nights of the month of Ramadan. </p>
<p>But this order of Sharia was totally against “Human Nature”. Even Sahaba (who were beacons of light and Eman) were not able to act upon this unnatural order of Sharia. Thus, they secretly started going to their wives during the nights of Ramadan. </p>
<p>Thereupon Muhammad realized his mistake, and in order to correct it, he made the drama of revelation of Quranic verses once again, which then permitted Sahaba to have sex with their wives even during the nights of Ramadan. </p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p>Surah Al-Baqarah (2:187)“<em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting). They are Libas (i.e., body-cover, or screen) for you and you are Libas for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves (by going to wives secretly), so He turned to you and forgave you (for this sin). So now you are allowed to have sexual relations with your wives.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/urn/178360" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sahih Bukhari, 4508</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p>Narrated Al-Bara': When the order of compulsory fasting of Ramadan was revealed, the people did not have sexual relations with their wives for the whole month of Ramadan, but some men cheated themselves (by violating that restriction). So Allah revealed: "Allah is aware that you were deceiving yourselves but He accepted your repentance and forgave you..".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Sahaba (who were the beacons of light and faith) were unable to control themselves for 30 nights, how can Muslim parents expect their young boys to abstain from sin until the age of 25 to 30 years (which is the average age of marriage for boys in Islamic countries today)?</p>
<p>Islamic apologists present this excuse that Muslim youth should FAST, as Muhammad prescribed to fast to overcome sexual urges.</p>
<p><span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong>But Muhammad was wrong that FASTING will take away sexual urges. The proof is that the companions of Muhammad were already fasting during the month of Ramadhan, still they were unable to control their sexual desires for only 30 nights, and they sinned.</strong></span></p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, <i>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 13h:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:<br>I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I am a young man and I am afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse and I cannot afford to marry." He kept silent, and then repeated my question once again, but he kept silent. I said the same (for the third time) and he remained silent. Then repeated my question (for the fourth time), and only then the Prophet said, "O Abu Huraira! The pen has dried after writing what you are going to confront. So (it does not matter whether you) get yourself castrated or not."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muslim societies have no other way to save their children from sins, except for marrying them just after they become adults. But practically, it is almost impossible in today's world. It was not even possible in the earlier times when due to poverty Prophet Muhammad got married at the age of 25 and Abu Huraira was also poor and was not able to marry a woman. </p>
<p>Moreover, Sahaba were even unable to abstain from sin during the short period of the wars:</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, <i>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 13o:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated 'Abdullah:<br>We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Apostle and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, "Shall we get ourselves castrated?" He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract </p>

<h2>Dead bodies of girls are taken out of their GRAVES and raped in Islamic Pakistan</h2>
<p>The frustration among Pakistani Muslim men has reached an appalling level, to the extent that even the corpses of women are violated after being taken out of their graves (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBtSvH7ps63b4wIFsRwMyt_b-Tt_ig%3A1646748029197&amp;ei=fWEnYqXNC8qG9u8P0vOu2AE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl_8G61rb2AhVKg_0HHdK5CxsQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6CAguENQCEJECOgsILhCABBDHARCjAjoLCC4QgAQQxwEQ0QM6BQgAEIAEOgoIABCRAhBGEPkBOgUIABCRAjoECAAQQzoHCC4Q1AIQQzoICC4QgAQQ1AI6BQguEJECOgQILhBDOggILhDUAhDLAToFCC4QywE6BQgAEMsBOgcIABAKEMsBOgcILhAKEMsBOgUILhCABDoICAAQFhAKEB46BggAEBYQHkoECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWKc0YKo2aAFwAXgAgAGaA4gB8UCSAQswLjE3LjE4LjMuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">link</a>).

<p>Many incidents in Egypt (and in Pakistan) occurred where youth harassed girls in mobs. Please see this <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://youtu.be/Zys959EGXWo" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">video about Tahrir Square</a>.</p>

<p>Muslim Women are abused and harassed by Muslim men during the most spiritual Hajj and 'Umra gatherings</p>
<p>During the most spiritual Hajj and 'Umra gatherings, Muslim women endure abuse and harassment from Muslim men. There are numerous stories shared by Muslim girls recounting their experiences of harassment during Hajj and 'Umra, which occurs due to the combined gatherings of women and men (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=women+harassed+sexually+during+Hajj&amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBveaB_WkezagqihdIsHL5Mwbml4YA:1650247804801&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=vid&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjD68iRxJz3AhVoRPEDHQAGASQQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;biw=1229&amp;bih=585&amp;dpr=1.56" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">link</a>).

<p dir="ltr">The fact that porn trends within the region can even be tracked was impressive, given that the sale of pornographic material has been banned in nearly every Arab country except Lebanon and Turkey.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More recently, the Saudi Arabian government also announced that it had hacked and disabled about 9,000 Twitter accounts associated with the publication of pornography and arrested many of the handles’ owners.

			<title>Changes in Sex Life After Leaving Islam</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islam-general/103-changes-in-sex-life-after-leaving-islam</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islam-general/103-changes-in-sex-life-after-leaving-islam</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>As a Muslim, sex life is constantly disturbed due to the <strong>combination</strong> of the following 2 obligations:</p>
<ol>
<li>The obligation to perform five daily prayers.</li>
<li>The obligation of taking a bath after sex (and you cannot offer any of your obligatory 5 prayers without taking a bath).</li>
</ol>
<p>These two elements work in <strong>conjunction</strong>, significantly influencing sexual life.</p>
<p>Upon leaving Islam, the most significant relief came from shedding the burden of performing five daily prayers. Islamic prayer felt like a constant <strong>responsibility</strong> that occupied the mind. Until this <strong>duty</strong> was <strong>fulfilled</strong>, I couldn't attain relaxation, hindering my focus on other aspects of life, be it studying, working, or simply enjoying life.</p>
<p>While Muslims may claim a sense of calm and relaxation after offering prayers, they might not realize that the prayer itself imposes a burden and responsibility. <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>The relief they feel post-prayer is simply the removal of this self-imposed mental tension which is a result of the feeling of fulfilling the duty</strong></span>. Without the obligation of prayers, individuals naturally experience freedom from tension and automatic relaxation.</p>
<p>Regarding the practice of "full body washing" after sex, it's worth noting that Muhammad adopted this from the Jews (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_purification#Judaism">Source</a>), similar to various other practices he incorporated from Jewish traditions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>Please be aware of the distinction between "wadhu" and "full body washing." While "wadhu" suffices for regular prayers, engaging in sexual activity leads to a state of severe impurity, requiring a "full body wash" before being allowed to pray.</p>
<p>Hence, if you decide to engage in intimacy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You still grapple with mental tension, having to calculate prayer timings to ensure they don't coincide with your intimate moments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The added stress of not only scheduling prayer times but also planning a "Bathing Time" before prayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During winter, an additional calculation is needed to warm the water for bathing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women, especially those with long hair, face challenges with the full-body bath, as they must wash their hair every time they engage in intimate activities. This adds significant difficulty to the lives of such women due to these Islamic regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concern extends to clothing, as individuals need to plan what to wear after intimacy, sometimes requiring ironing before engaging in such activities, followed by an immediate visit to the mosque for congregational prayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only is your soul considered impure, but your body, clothes, bed sheets, and blankets are also deemed impure, necessitating their washing. Sperm and female sexual discharges are viewed as repulsive, akin to urine and faeces, in the minds of religious Muslims.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Brief time intervals between Noon/Afternoon/Evening/Night Prayers:</h3>
<p>Another challenge arises from the brief breaks between noon, afternoon, evening, and night prayers. If you desire intimacy during this period (noon till evening), you are almost always juggling prayer timings, bathing, and clothing concerns.</p>
<p>For many individuals, sexual FULFILLMENT isn't achieved through a single ejaculation. Instead, satisfaction is derived from the entire lovemaking process, which typically unfolds as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Engaging in foreplay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For most men, the initial ejaculation is a brief affair lasting only a few seconds to a few minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relishing a period of rest or sleeping unclothed with one's partner. Many women desire to remain in their partner's embrace as a gesture of love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparing for the second round of intimacy, which tends to last longer than the first and often culminates in sexual SATISFACTION.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those in their youth, the desire for multiple additional rounds of intimacy may be common.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Morning Prayer:</strong></h3>
<p>A grave injustice is done when it comes to "morning sex," which many men consider a significant blessing.</p>
<p>During the summer season, the morning prayer is between 3 am to 5 am (depending on the country you are residing in). It heavily disturbs both your sleep and sex life. </p>
<p>After offering the morning prayer at the mosque, it becomes challenging for the desire for intimacy to resurface. Firstly, there is the pressure of getting to the office on time, and secondly, the need to allocate time for a bath (as one cannot offer the noon prayer at work while in a state of impurity).</p>
<p>Winter exacerbates the difficulty, particularly with the prospect of bathing in cold water (unless considerable time is invested in warming the water before the bath).</p>
<p>Morning intimacy poses a particular challenge for working women, and the difficulty is heightened if they have long hair. The idea of voluntarily taking a cold bath on a winter morning before heading to the office is inconceivable, as it risks falling ill.</p>
<h3><strong>Night Prayer:</strong></h3>
<p>You have enough time to make love after the night prayer though.</p>
<p>However, it is not without its challenges. Not all men are equally active sexually during the night to engage in the complete cycle of intimacy. Some desire one round of love at night and then a 2nd or 3rd round in the morning. Yet, achieving this can be difficult for Muslims, as both partners are compelled to take a full-body bath at night. Failing to do so means they must bathe with cold water early in the morning before Fajr (the morning prayer).</p>
<h3>Weekend Intimacy:</h3>
<p>Per a friend's account, his wife tends to discourage intimacy throughout the week but expresses readiness for lovemaking during the weekends. However, this comes with a unique condition – she applies half a liter of coconut oil to her hair. She then informs her husband:</p>
<p>"In English: <strong>Listen, Darling, if you wish to make love, then come now; otherwise, I am going to take a bath in half an hour.</strong>"</p>
<p>(Note: The couple is originally from the Indian Subcontinent, where it's common for women to use a significant amount of hair oil for hair care. However, this excessive use of hair oil can be a deterrent for their partners' desire for intimacy.)</p>
<p>Once she completes her bath, a "No Entry" sign goes up, although the wife appears even more charming and attractive after taking a bath and with her beautifully done hair.</p>
<h3><strong>Lesson:</strong></h3>
<p>It is good to take a bath after sex, but if your partner has taken a bath and made herself neat and clean before the sex, then certainly it is more important than taking a bath afterwards.  </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>Actually, it is not only the sex but also the "<strong>nightfall</strong>" which brings you to a state of severe impurity according to Islam. And young boys normally have no courage to ask their mothers to make them water warm during the night or early in the morning before the morning prayer. </p>
<p>Actually, everyone came to know about the "nightfall" if I tried to take a bath before the morning prayer. Therefore, I went to the bathroom secretly even much before the morning prayer and took a bath with even cold water. Still my family came to know about my nightfall as the bathroom was wet due to the bath. </p>
<p>Masturbation brings you into a state of impurity too, and you need to take a whole body bath. Perhaps 99% of Muslims indulge in the practice of masturbation too, despite it's been not allowed. </p>
<h3>Religious Constraints Impact Marital Satisfaction:</h3>
<p>I wonder whether individuals adhering to religious beliefs can adequately prioritize the needs and contentment of their spouses.</p>
<p>Sexuality often carries a stigma among the religious, deeming it impure. Practices like oral sex are strongly discouraged due to the perceived impurity associated with male and female discharges.</p>
<p>Open communication about sexual matters is hindered by notions of modesty within religious communities. Discussing such topics openly with one's partner is considered contrary to these modesty norms.</p>
<p>Religious guidelines, such as reciting a prayer (DUA) to Allah before engaging in sexual activities, further divert one's focus and concentration during intimate moments with their spouse.</p>
<h3><strong>Lesson:</strong></h3>
<p>One can confidently assert that a considerable transformation occurred in the realm of sexual experiences after embracing irreligiosity. Unexplored dimensions in one's sex life emerged, previously unknown to the individual as a religious person. A mind liberated from tension and stress can truly savor and enhance the experience of intimacy.</p>
<h3>Islamic apologists: But Prophet Muhammad used to easily have sex with all his wives in one night</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The era of Muhammad was different from our era.</p>
<p>During Muhammad's time, there were no office obligations or early morning work hours. He enjoyed the luxury of a leisurely day with ample time for both intimate relations and bathing. Additionally, people in that era typically retired to bed early, directly after the Isha prayer, giving them sufficient rest until the morning prayer.</p>
<p>Contrastingly, today's working hours are longer, and people retire to bed much later, around 10 pm or even later. Engaging in intimate activities after 10 pm can lead to inadequate sleep, especially when there's an early morning commitment to prayer/sex (or both) as well as taking a bath after it.</p>
<p>Muhammad's practice of bathing early in the morning raises questions about the feasibility of all his wives doing the same without complaints (especially when there were no attached bathrooms in that era and many women had to go to public Hamams in the middle of the night to take a bath).</p>
<p>Women today find it challenging to adhere to such a routine, particularly in winter when warming water becomes an additional task. Furthermore, Muhammad's wives didn't have professional commitments after the morning prayer, while contemporary women often have work or academic responsibilities.</p>
<p>Warm water may be available in winter today, but only in big cities. Poor families and those living in villages and remote areas, still don't have such luxury. </p>
<h3><strong>Islamic Apologists: No need to change the clothes as 'Aisha used to scrap the semen from garments with her nails</strong></h3>
<p>Islamic apologists argue that there's no need to change clothes after semen stains, citing the example of 'Aisha, who supposedly scraped semen from garments with her nails (<a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:537">Sahih Hadith</a>).</p>
<p>However, personally, dealing with semen-stained clothes became impractical due to the general disgust Muslims feel toward semen as a significant impurity. While Islam provides two methods for purifying clothes – washing in water and removing dry semen with nails, the latter proved challenging in practice.</p>
<p>Attempts to rid clothes of dry semen using nails were largely unsuccessful. Despite broken nails, the task was nearly impossible, leading to the clothes being rendered unusable. The alternative was washing them with water.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the Sahih Hadith where 'Aisha supposedly employed this method, it raises questions about the feasibility of the process. One wonders how 'Aisha managed to accomplish it successfully.</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>I wonder how Muhammad asked 'Aisha to do it for him (i.e. to scratch his semen from his garments). I personally never got the courage to ask my wife for this service. I would have not allowed her to do this even if she was ready to do it. The reason is simple semen was a disgusting thing for me when I was a Muslim. I was compelled to do it for the first time when I had no other clothes and water and had to offer the prayer at the right time. Thus, I tried to remove the semen with my nails but failed miserably. </p>]]></description>

			<title>Did the Quran Really State that the Universe Is Expanding?</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">According to science, the universe has been continuously expanding. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Modern Muslim apologists (like Zakir Naik) recently distorted the translation of Quranic Verse 51:47 and claimed that Allah already told the continuous expansion of the universe in the Quran. Their modern distorted translation is as under:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 51:47) وَالسَّمَاءَ بَنَيْنَاهَا بِأَيْدٍ <u><strong>وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ</strong></u><br />Translations: </p>
<p dir="ltr">(Muhammad Asad) "It is we who have built the universe with [our creative] power; and, verily, <u>it is we who are steadily expanding it."</u> (Harun Yahya used this translation in his book. <a href="http://www.creationofuniverse.com/html/bigbang_04.html">Link</a>)</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Hilali/Khan) With power did We construct the heaven. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Verily, We are Able to extend the vastness of space thereof</span>. (Zakir Naik used this translation in his book. <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=r6_EAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12&amp;lpg=PT12&amp;dq=51:47+quran+and+the+modern+science+by+zakir+naik&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-acEUDOujh&amp;sig=ACfU3U3N-nrZd1HT2y5Z891R54t8-fh8Ng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5zqKx6NziAhXuMewKHY78CrcQ6AEwDXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=51%3A47%20quran%20and%20the%20modern%20science%20by%20zakir%20naik&amp;f=false">Link</a>)</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Khalifa) "We constructed the sky with our hands, <u>and we will continue to expand it."</u></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"> This is clearly a heavily distorted translation of the last 2 words of this verse (i.e. وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ<strong>)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">وَإِنَّا  means "and indeed, We (Allah)"</p>
<p dir="ltr">لَمُوسِعُونَ means "are the Expander".</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, the correct translation of this verse is:</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 51:47) <i>And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> We (Allah) are [its] expander</strong></span>.</i></p>
<p dir="ltr">The term “lamūsi‘ūn” in this verse is a "<strong>NOUN</strong>"  and not a "<strong>Verb</strong>", and it <strong>describes "God" and not the "heaven"</strong> (i.e. the term “lamūsi‘ūn” means "God is the Expander", and not "the Universe is Expanding". </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Word by Word Translation and Grammar provided by Corpus Quran:</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Corpus Quran is a Muslim project, where that provided the word-by-word translation and grammar of the Quran. Let us see what they are saying (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=51&amp;verse=47">link</a>):</p>

<h4>Verse (51:47)</h4>
<p class="verseImage"><a href="http://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=51&amp;verse=47#(51:47:1)"><img src="http://www.everyayah.com/data/images_png/51_47.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><b>Sahih International</b>: <i>And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> We are [its] expander</strong></span>.</i></p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the "literal" meaning of the word "<em>mūsi‘" .</em> However, in Quran, this word and its derivatives have been used in the meanings of "<strong>Encompassing"</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Look at the following verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 6.80) My Lord wasi‘a (encompasses) everything in His knowledge. </p>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 7.89) Our Lord wasi‘a (encompasses) everything in His knowledge. </p>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 20.98) [He] wasi‘a (encompasses) everything in His knowledge. </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Also see verse 65:12, where directly the word of "<strong>احاط</strong>" (encompass) has been used instead of "wasi'a"</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 65:12) وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ <strong>أَحَاطَ</strong> بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا<br />Translation: and that God encompasses everything in knowledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">So, then verse 51.47 must be understood as follows:<strong> "And the heaven We built it with might and We lamūsi‘ūn (encompasses it)."</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This verse confirms that heaven is completely within and under God’s control. There is no reference whatsoever to the expansion of heaven. The term “<em>lamūsi‘ūn</em>” <strong>describes God, not heaven</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">None of the earlier translators ever gave this meaning of "Present perfect continuous" like modern Islam apologists. Let us see some of the earlier translations: </p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Yusuf Ali: With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: <em>for it is We Who create the vastness of space</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pickthal: We have built the heaven with might, <em>and We it is Who make the vast extent (thereof)</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shakir: And the heaven, We raised it high with power, <em>and most surely We are the makers of things ample</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">H/K/Saheeh: And the heaven We constructed with strength, <em>and indeed, We are [its] expander</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Also, see the meaning of wasi‘a in this arabic-english dictionary <a href="http://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/وسع/">here</a>. </p>
<h3 dir="ltr">The wrong Translation of Modern Muslims is exposed in the next verse of 51:48</h3>
<p dir="ltr">A lie has no feet. Modern Islam apologists got exposed in the next verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 51:48) وَالْأَرْضَ فَرَشْنَاهَا فَنِعْمَ الْمَاهِدُونَ<br />Translation: We have spread out the earth; how excellent a spreader/smoother We are!</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">In this verse, the word الْمَاهِدُونَ (spreader/smoother) has exactly the same grammar (Active Participle Form I) as the word لَمُوسِعُونَ (i.e. expander) in the previous verse.<br />If we have to follow the Muslim logic of the previous verse, then the translation of the next verse becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 51:48) We have spread out the earth; <strong>and We are still steadily spreading/smoothing it</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Let us see the translation and grammar at Corpus Quran (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170915115710/http://corpus.quran.com/wordmorphology.jsp?location=(51:48:4)">link</a>):</p>

<h4>Verse (51:48)</h4>
<p class="first">The analysis above refers to the 48th verse of chapter 51 (<i class="ab">sūrat l-dhāriyāt</i>):</p>
<p class="verseImage"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170915115710/http://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=51&amp;verse=48#(51:48:1)"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20170915115710im_/http://www.everyayah.com/data/images_png/51_48.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><b>Sahih International</b>: <i>And the earth We have spread out, and excellent is the preparer.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Obviously, even these modern Quran translators also don't believe that Allah is still spreading/smoothing the earth. Therefore, here they didn't translate it as they did in the previous verse. Let us see how they translate this next verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Hilali/Kan 51:48) And We have spread out the earth, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>how Excellent Spreader (thereof) are We!</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">(Asad 51:48) And the earth have We spread out wide - and how well have We ordered it!</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Khalifa 51:48) And we made the earth habitable; a perfect design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">So, you can see the wickedness of these Translators and Islam apologists like Zakir Naik and Harun Yahya. </p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Universe consists of "Space", while Quranic Sky is a solid Dome which could not expand</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Actually, Islam is not only wrong, but it is "so much wrong" that one gets confused as to where to start explaining its wrong claims. </p>
<p dir="ltr">According to science, the universe consists of space and galaxies are travelling away from each other in this space thus it is considered an expansion of the universe. </p>
<p dir="ltr">But according to the writer of the Quran: </p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>There is no mention of the universe, but it talks only about the earth and the 7 skies. <br />Islam apologists of today dishonestly distort the meaning of the Quranic word "Sama" (i.e. Sky), and claim it to be "universe". </li>
<li>But according to the writer of the Quran, these 7 Skies are "solid" Domes, where prophets are residing along with their people. </li>
<li>And it is impossible for a solid Dome to expand like the universe is expanding due to the travelling of galaxies in space. </li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">No mention of the continuous expansion of the Universe in 800,000 Ahadith of Islam</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Billions of Muslims read the whole Quran during the last 14 centuries, but none of them found continuous expansion of the universe in the Quran. <br />But in recent times, when scientific advancement was made and people came to know about the expansion of the universe, then the Islam apologists came into action and forcefully extracted the expansion of the universe from the Quran by distortion. <br />Muslims have more than 800,000 Ahadith, but again for the last 1400 years, nobody found expansion of the universe in them too.</p>

			<title>Quranic Mistake: The heart is responsible for Thinking </title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/scientific-mistakes-in-the-revelation/198-quranic-mistake-the-heart-is-responsible-for-thinking</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/scientific-mistakes-in-the-revelation/198-quranic-mistake-the-heart-is-responsible-for-thinking</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the era of Muhammad and before him, people (including scientists like Aristotle) were literally of the opinion that it is the heart which is responsible for thinking and understanding and beliefs and faith.</li>
<li>There is no All-Knowing Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was himself making the religion in the name of Allah and the revelation. Since Muhammad was only a human (and not All-Knowing), thus he made a human mistake and repeated that common scientific mistake in the Quranic verses and Ahadith. </li>
<li>But science finally cleared all doubts in the 16th century, and established it without any doubts that it is not the heart, but the brain which thinks, reasons, understands etc.</li>
<li>But for Muslims, it was impossible to agree with science, while the Quran and Ahadith are clear that it is the heart which is responsible in the literal sense for thinking and understanding.</li>
<li>Therefore, Muslim preachers of this century broke all records of their abilities to deceive people by making lame excuses. They twisted the scientific facts and came up with deceptive scientific claims that it is the heart which is responsible for thinking and understanding. </li>
<li>After this deception by Muslim preachers, it was no more a scientific mistake of the Quran, but it became a scientific MIRACLE of the Quran.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, such deceptions cannot last long, and sooner or later the truth becomes evident:</p>
<ul>
<li>Science first made an artificial heart. And despite that artificial heart absolutely no change took place in the thinking, understanding, reasoning and beliefs of people. </li>
<li>Secondly, science also replaced the human heart with a genetically modified PIG heart. And now the centre of faith (Imaan إيمان) is the pig's heart. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Detailed Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Muhammad copied this scientific mistake only from our ancient ancestors, who were the first ones, who thought that it was the heart which was responsible for thinking, reasoning and wisdom. Adam Elmasri explains it in his video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D90f3vlTvJI">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zaker Naik didn’t realize that <span style="font-size: 1rem;">he confirmed that the Quran fell into a widely spread common </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">mistake that mankind held as true since the dawn of time. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This widely spread common mistake is known in history as “<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Cardio-centric hypothesis</strong></span>”. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The cardio-centric hypothesis was the historical belief that the heart controls sensation, </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">thought, and body movement. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Cardio centrism was first derived from the ancient Egyptian belief that the heart was </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">the house of thought and soul. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The ancient Egyptians believed that the heart rather than the brain was the source of human </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">wisdom and the centre of emotions and memory. </span></p>
<p>This is why, during the mummification process, the ancient Egyptians would take all the valuable organs out of the deceased body and preserve them in vessels next to the mummy. While they leave the heart and ONLY the heart inside the mummy. As for the brain, it was a useless organ. They didn’t preserve the brain. Rather, they used a hock shaped needle to take out the brain through the nose and dispose of it.</p>
<p>Like the Egyptians, Ancient Mesopotamians too believed that the heart was the organ responsible for intellect and was in control of the motor and sensory systems. The heart, not the brain! </p>
<p>It wasn’t until the ancient Greeks that we find a division and controversy about the organ served as the seat of the soul and thought. </p>
<p>Some favoured the heart or the cardiocentric view and among them was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Aristotle</strong></span>. Others favored the brain or the cephalocentric view and among them was Plato and Pythagoras. </p>
<p><strong>However, throughout history, it was Aristotle's contributions that have been more influential than Plato’s, particularly when it comes to science and logical reasoning. So the wider spread idea through the ancient world, and the mainstream consensus was the idea that we think and understand by the heart rather than the brain!</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0700ff;"><strong>It wasn’t really until the 16th century</strong></span> that we came to understand the nervous system. And only in the last 100 years or so that we established Neuroscience or what we call Neurology.</p>
<p>And you will find all the relevant references in the description box under the video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D90f3vlTvJI">link</a>). </p>
<p><strong>So it is no surprise that all our human languages carry the evidence of our ignorance and the long-held wrong belief that we think, reason and comprehend by the heart. It is no wonder that nearly all languages have statements such as “memorized by heart” or “Love you from the bottom of my heart” – Because WE DID NOT KNOW, until very very recently that we love from the brain and we also memorize, think and understand from the brain.</strong></p>
<p>We simply didn’t know. But, didn’t the creator of the universe know that? How could God fall into the same trap of human ignorance and send down a book saying verses like “They have hearts they do not understand with” and “they travelled the land so their hearts may reason”?</p>
<p>Didn’t God of the Quran know that we think and reason by the brain? Isn’t it appropriate, that when God sends down a book to correct human mistakes rather than carry them on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since there is no All-Knowing Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was himself making the religion in the name of Allah and the revelation. Since Muhammad was only a human (and not All-Knowing), thus he made a human mistake and repeated that common scientific mistake in the Quranic verses and Ahadith. </p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/7.179">7:179</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">They have hearts with which they do not understand</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/63.3">63:3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their <strong>hearts are sealed so that they understand not</strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/22.46">22:46</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Have they not journeyed in the land that </span><span style="color: #0700ff;"><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">their hearts might understand</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> and <strong>their ears might listen</strong>? For indeed it is not the eyes that are blinded; it is rather the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">hearts,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> which are in the breasts</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> that are rendered blind.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muslim preacher Zakir Naik came up with an excuse that the "heart" in the Quran means only "intelligence". But this verse refuted Zakir Naik completely when it says:  “...<strong> the hearts</strong>, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>which are in the breasts</strong></span>", and we know that no intelligence is present in the "breasts".</p>
<p>Similarly, all Ahadith of Muhummad are also proving that Muhammad was not talking in any figurative sense, but in the literal sense that it is the heart which is responsible for thinking, understanding and Faith (Imaan إيمان).</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3346">Sunan Tirmidhi, 3346</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet of Allah said: “While I was at the House, between sleeping and being awake, I heard someone saying: “The one in the middle of the three.’ I was brought a vessel of gold containing Zamzam water, so my chest was split, to here.’” – Qatadah said: “I said to Anas: ‘What does that mean?’ He said: ‘To the lowest part of his stomach.’” – He said: “<strong>So my heart was removed, and washed with Zamzam water, then returned to its placed</strong>. Then I was filled with Faith and wisdom.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:52">Sahih Bukhari, 52</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good (reformed) but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4244">Sunan Ibn Majah, 4244</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “When the believer commits sin, <strong>a black spot appears on his heart</strong>. If he repents and gives up that sin and seeks forgiveness, his heart will be polished. But if (the sin) increases, (the black spot) increases. That is the Ran that Allah mentions in His Book: “Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn.” [83:14]</div>
<div class="hadith_narrated">Grade: Sahih (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230128215411/https://dorar.net/h/iM7ZnFuS?sims=1">Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Al-Syuti. And Albani declared it Hasan. Nevertheless, Albani declared a similar hadith from Tariq bin Shihad to be <strong>Sahih</strong></a>)</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<div class="text_details">
<p>Modern science contradicts the claims made by Muhammad and Allah regarding the hearts of individuals. According to scientific evidence, there are no black spots on the hearts, even of sinners, and the color of hearts is the same for Muslims and non-Muslims.</p>
<p>Muhammad may have thought he could make unfounded claims about the heart without anyone verifying them. However, with the advancement of modern science, these claims were exposed as deceptive and scientifically incorrect. Science has been able to identify the scientific mistakes present in the teachings of Allah and Muhammad, challenging the validity of their assertions about the heart.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p><a href="https://hadithprophet.com/hadith-16523.html">Musnad Ahmad, 12381 </a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>عن أنس قال: كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول: " الإسلام علانية، والإيمان في القلب " قال: ثم يشير بيده إلى صدره ثلاث مرات قال: ثم يقول: " التقوى هاهنا، التقوى هاهنا</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "Islam is an outward manifestation, and faith is in the heart." He then pointed towards his chest three times and said: "And piety is here (in the heart)."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hence, to support the Quranic verses and Hadiths, the Islamic preachers of this century have taken deception to new levels, transforming what is a scientific error into a supposed scientific miracle of the Quran. They have vigorously propagated this so-called miracle far and wide.</p>
<p>For example, this Islamic preachers claims (<a href="https://www.letmeturnthetables.com/2008/10/is-heart-responsible-for-understanding.html">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research has shown that the heart communicates to the brain in four major ways: neurologically (through the transmission of nerve impulses), biochemically (via hormones and neurotransmitters), biophysically (through pressure waves) and energetically (through electromagnetic field interactions). Communication along all these conduits significantly affects the brain's activity. Moreover, our research shows that messages the heart sends the brain can also affect performance. [ Source : <a href="http://www.heartmath.org/research/science-of-the-heart/soh_20.html">Science of The Heart:Exploring the Role of the Heart in Human Performance</a>]</p>
<p>Yasha Kresh, PhD, Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Medicine, Research Director of Cardiothoracic Surgery says: "It turns out that the heart has its own 'brain' - an intrinsic nervous system. It's not clear what it does or if it's subservient to the higher brain. But it's clear that it is there, and I believe it has a mission because evolution does not allow things to remain without purpose. We think this internal nervous system helps to fine-tune and integrate the heart's diverse activity."

<p>Dear Muslim friends,</p>
<p>Please think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we now believe that the center of faith lies within a pig's heart?</li>
<li>Or should we consider that artificial hearts (machines) govern our emotions, love, and reasoning?</li>

<h2>One more Muslim argument: Behavioral changes in heart transplant recipients reflecting their donors' personalities</h2>
<p>MuslimSkeptic Website came up with this argument (<a href="https://muslimskeptic.com/2022/06/20/heart-islam-scientism/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2000, three authors associated with American universities penned an article titled <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10882878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Changes in Heart Transplant Recipients That Parallel the Personalities of Their Donors</em></a> for the <em>Integrative Medicine</em> journal.</p>
<p>They studied <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>many cases</strong></span> and directly interviewed not only transplant recipients but also their families and friends, and also those of the donors. They claimed that the transplant recipient very often replicated some of the donor’s most unique behavioral traits – as if there was some sort of experiential or emotional transfer which had occurred.</p>
<p>They write: "<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Two to 5 parallels per case were observed between changes following surgery and the histories of the donors. </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Parallels included changes in food, music, art, sexual, recreational, and career preferences, as well as specific instances of perceptions of names and sensory experiences related to the donors</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> (e.g., one donor was killed by a gun shot to the face; the recipient had dreams of seeing hot flashes of light in his face)" </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>The study involved only 10 participants, making it a small and singular investigation. No further studies have replicated these findings since 2000, raising questions about its validity. While a professor wrote a book on this topic in 2020, it remains a hypothesis and not a comprehensive study.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some Muslim preachers readily accept this singular hypothesis while rejecting the well-supported Theory of Evolution, which is based on numerous studies and overwhelming evidence. This inconsistency raises concerns about double standards in evaluating scientific claims.</p>
<p>Even if these Muslim preachers believe in this study of so-called “cellular memory”, against all scientific standards, still how they cannot see that the influence of the heart is minimal to negligible on the thinking and reasoning ability of a person (even according to this study). In no way, it could be said that the heart is sealed, and thus a person loses his ability to make the right decision. The brain still stays the organ, which is responsible for thinking and reasoning. </p>
<h2>Muslim excuse: The heart controls emotions, and thus the heart controls the emotional decisions, not the brain</h2>
<p>Another Muslim preacher argued that the heart possesses neurons, an intrinsic nervous system, and maintains a "Heart Brain Connection." According to this preacher, the heart controls emotions, leading to emotional decisions, and not the brain.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>However, similar qualities can be found in other organs as well. For instance, the digestive system also contains neurons, an intrinsic nervous system, and communicates with the brain to influence emotions.</p>
<p>To gain more insights, you can inquire the following questions from <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do emotions control the heart, or does the heart control emotions?</li>
<li>Does the heart regulate the pain system, or is it controlled by the brain?</li>
<li>Does the digestive system impact emotions?</li>
<li>Are there neurons in the digestive system?</li>
<li>Does the digestive system communicate with the brain?</li>
<li>Which organs possess an intrinsic nervous system?</li>
</ul>
<p>The fundamental questions remain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will a Muslim become a non-believer after receiving a non-believer's heart?</li>
<li>Will a Muslim start behaving like a pig after receiving a pig's heart?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is unfortunate that some Muslim preachers still claim that the Quran speaks the truth about the heart.</li>
<li>It is disheartening to witness the immense power of propaganda wielded by these preachers, which continues to mislead and confuse millions of people on this matter.</li>
<li>It is regrettable that we must still spend time refuting such baseless Quranic claims in the 21st century.</li>

			<title>The Verse of Killing all Polytheists (Quran 9:5) is still VALID today</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/dangers-from-an-islamic-state/105-the-verse-of-killing-all-polytheists-quran-9-5-is-still-valid-today</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>Do you remember that ISIS took Jizya from Christians in Iraq and let them live, but ISIS didn't take Jizya from Yazidis and killed their men and enslaved their women?</p>
<p>Here is the reason:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Salafi Islam (and also according to Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal), Jizya is allowed only for Christians/Jews/Zoroastrians (who are known as the "<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahl_al-kit%C4%81b">people of the Book أهل الكتاب</a>" in Islam).</li>
<li>But as far as other non-Muslims (like Atheists, Deists, Hindus, Buddhists etc.) are concerned, then they cannot live even by paying Jizya. They either have to accept Islam, or they should be slaughtered.</li>
<li>Muhammad himself didn't accept Jizya from the polytheists of Arabia but after the revelation of the verse of the sword (i.e. killing all polytheists after 4 months), he forced all of them to accept Islam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later, some Muslim jurists like Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik said that it was limited only to the polytheists of Arabia, but as far as the polytheists of the non-Arab world are concerned, they could live by paying Jizya.</p>
<p>But other Muslim jurists like Imam Shafii and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (and modern-day Salafists) disagree. According to them, non-Arab non-Muslims also don't have any right to live even through paying Jizya. They either have to accept Islam or they should be slaughtered.</p>
<p>This means that if Salafists form an Islamic State today, then they will kill all non-Muslims like Atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, etc. (accept for Jews/Christians/Magians who can stay alive by paying Jizya). </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Details: </h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/9.5">9:5</a>:</p>
<p>And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent,<strong><em> </em></strong>establish<strong><em> prayer, </em></strong>and give<strong><em> zakah</em></strong> (<em>i.e. if they become Muslims</em>), let them [go] on their way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quranic Verse about killing polytheists has become a problem for Islam apologists, while the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) ordered to kill “<strong>all</strong> polytheists” in it if they don't accept Islam. They were not even allowed to stay alive by paying the Jizya (Verse <a href="https://quranx.com/9.29">9:29</a>), which was reserved only for Jews &amp; Christians. This was the main tactic which Muhammad used to spread Islam.</p>
<p>Imam Wahidi recorded under the <a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;tTafsirNo=86&amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;tAyahNo=105&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=2">Tafsir of verse 5:105</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn 'Abbas said: “The Messenger of Allah sent a letter to the people of Hajar, whose chief was Mundhir ibn Sawa, inviting them to Islam, or to pay the Jizyah if they chose not to embrace Islam. When Mundhir ibn Sawa received the letter, he showed it to the Arabs, Jews, Christians, Sabeans and Magians who were around him. They all agreed to pay the Jizyah and disliked embracing Islam. <strong>The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, wrote back to him, saying: 'As for the Arabs, do not accept from them except Islam otherwise they will have nothing but the sword. As for the people of the Book and the Magians, accept the Jizyah from them.</strong> When this letter was read to them, the Arabs embraced Islam while the people of the Book and the Magians agreed to pay the Jizyah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But today Muslims are weaker than other nations, therefore Islam apologists are forced to hide the real face of Islam. They fear if the rest of the world comes to know it, then polytheists are going to kill Muslims as Muhammad used to slaughter the polytheists.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 9th Hijri year (one year before his death), Muhammad got “absolute power” and no one was left there in the entire Arabia who could have opposed him. Thus, then in the 9th Hijri year, Muhammad claimed the revelation of verse 9:5 and made the killing of all polytheists Halal (permissible) for Muslims. </li>
<li>The peace treaty which Muhammad signed in the 7th Hijri year (at the time of the victory of Mecca) was not with the whole of Arabia, but only with the tribes living in Mecca and around it.</li>
<li>Thus, whoever had a covenant, their covenant lasted till the end of the covenant. While the other polytheists, who didn't have any covenant, their killing started after 4 months. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Allah (i.e. Muhammad) didn't even allow polytheists to stay alive after paying Jizya (i.e. only Jews, Christians and Magians were allowed to live by paying Jizya)</h2>
<p>The Quranic verse 9:29 testifies two issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, to wage a war against Jews and Christians was not due to the reason that they were fighting Muslims, but it was due to the reason that they didn’t believe in Allah and Muhammad.</li>
<li>Secondly, Jizya was limited only to Jews and Christians. </li>
</ol>
<blockquote lang="zxx">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/9.29">9:29</a>:</blockquote>
<blockquote lang="zxx">Fight those people of the Book (Jews and Christians) who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, do not refrain from what has been prohibited by Allah and His Messenger and do not embrace the religion of truth (Al-Islam), until they pay Jizya (protection tax) with their own hands and feel themselves subdued.</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, Allah (i.e. Muhammad) limited Jizya only to the “People of the Book” (i.e. Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians) in this verse, while polytheists were not even allowed to live after paying the Jizya. <strong>Polytheists either had to accept Islam, or they would be killed after 4 months (or till the end of their covenant). </strong></p>
<p>And then there are traditions which are clear about how Muslims killed even peaceful polytheists after the revelation of this verse:</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, Book of Battles (<a href="http://www.hadithurdu.com/01/1-2-1544/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">Narrated Jarir: In the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance there was a house called Dhu-l-Khalasa or Al-Ka'ba Al-Yamaniya or Al-Ka'ba Ash-Shamiya. The Prophet said to me, "Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l-Khalasa?" So I set out with one-hundred-and-fifty riders, and we dismantled it and killed whoever was present there. Then I came to the Prophet and informed him, and he invoked good upon us and Al-Ahmas (tribe) .</blockquote>
<p>Musanif Ibn Abi Shaybah, 6/586, Kitab-ul-Hadood, chapter of في الزنادقة ما حدهم (<a href="http://hadithportal.com/index.php?show=bab&amp;bab_id=4412&amp;chapter_id=24&amp;book=62&amp;sub_idBab=0&amp;f=4245&amp;e=4426">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">Some people used to worship their idols secretly. They were arrested and brought to 4th caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib. He consulted the people how to punish them. People suggested to kill them. Ali said: No, I will not simply kill them, but I will do that act which was performed by them against my ancestor Abraham. After that Ali burnt all of them in the fire.</blockquote>
<h2>Disagreement among Muslim Scholars regarding the killing of ALL Polytheists after the death of Muhammad</h2>
<p>All Muslim Scholars agree that Muhammad didn't leave any polytheist to survive by paying Jizya. He compelled them either to accept Islam or to be slaughtered. </p>
<p><a href="https://shamela.ws/book/767/5031" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Al-Muhalla bi’l-Aathaar</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>لم يختلف مسلمان في أن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - لم يقبل من الوثنيين من العرب إلا الإسلام أو السيف</p>
<p>There is no difference among the Muslims that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not accept anything from the Arab idolators except Islam or the sword</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=DyUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ikhtilaf al-Fuqaha</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أجمعوا على أن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - أبى أخذ الجزية من عبدة الأوثان من العرب ولم يقبل منهم إلا الإسلام أو السيف</p>
<p>There is consensus that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ refused to accept Jizya from the idol worshipers from the Arabs and did not accept anything from them except Islam or the sword</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the disagreement occurred later among the opinions of 4 Sunni Imams: </p>
<ul>
<li>Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (and present-day Salafists) all rule that except for Jews/Christians/Magians, all other non-Muslims (like Atheists, Buddhists, Hindus etc.) should be killed all over the world. They don't have any right to stay alive even after paying Jizya. </li>
<li>But Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik said that the killing of all other non-Muslims was limited only to the Arab polytheists. But non-Arab polytheists can be allowed to stay alive by paying Jizya. </li>
</ul>
<p>ٰIbn Kathir wrote under the commentary of verse <a href="https://quran.com/9:29/tafsirs/ar-tafsir-ibn-kathir">9:29</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وقد استدل بهـذه الآية الكريمة من يرى أنه لا تؤخذ الجزية إلا من أهل الكتاب أو من أشباههم كالمجوس كما صح فيهم الحديث أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذها من مجوس هجر وهذا مذهب الشافعي وأحمد في المشهور عنه وقال أبو حنيفة رحمه الله: بل تؤخذ من جميع الأعاجم سواء كانوا من أهل الكتاب أو من المشركين ولا تؤخذ من العرب إلا من أهل الكتاب. وقال الإمام مالك: بل يجوز أن تضرب الجزية على جميع الكفار من كتابي ومجوسي ووثني وغير ذلك ولمأخذ هذه المذاهب</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:342">This noble verse was cited as evidence by those who believe that the jizya (a tax paid by non-Muslims living in a Muslim-majority state) should only be collected from the People of the Book or from those who are similar to them, such as the Zoroastrians. This is the opinion of Imam al-Shafi'i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his most famous opinion.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:217">Abu Hanifa said: "On the contrary, the jizya should be collected from all non-Arabs, whether they are People of the Book or polytheists. However, it should only be collected from Arabs if they are People of the Book."</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:165">Imam Malik said: "On the contrary, it is permissible to impose the jizya on all infidels, whether they are People of the Book, Zoroastrians, polytheists, or others."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Ijma' (Consensus) of the Companions of Muhammad still allows killing all non-Arab non-Muslims</h2>
<p>Although Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik gave a ruling that all non-Arab non-Muslims are allowed to stay alive by paying Jizya, but it goes against the direct consensus of the Companions of Muhammad. </p>
<p>When Umar Ibn Khattab conquered Persia, he used this same verse 9:5 as an argument to kill them, and all the Sahaba (companions) stayed quiet upon it and no one opposed Umar Ibn Khattab by telling him that this verse was limited to Polytheist of Mecca or Arabia only. Therefore, there was an IJMA (unanimous decision) by Sahaba upon this verse that it ordered the killing of all the Polytheists (even if they are non-Arabs).</p>
<p>But then Umar Ibn Khattab didn’t kill the Persians while Ali and 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf told him that Magians of Persia were also counted as “People of the Book” by Prophet Muhammad. Thus, he took Jazya from them, and then he let them live.</p>
<p>Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqallani recorded this Sahih (authentic) tradition (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151001053419/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?flag=1&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=5744">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">وروى عبد بن حميد في تفسير سورة البروج بإسناد صحيح عن ابن أبزى " لما هزم المسلمون أهل فارس قال عمر : اجتمعوا . فقال : إن المجوس ليسوا أهل كتاب فنضع عليهم ، ولا من عبدة الأوثان فنجري عليهم أحكامهم فقال علي : بل هم أهل كتاب "’</blockquote>
<blockquote lang="zxx">When Muslims defeated the Persians, then Umar Ibn Khattab asked Sahaba (companions) to gather and to tell him what to do with the Persians as they are neither from the “People of Book” that they could take Jizya from them, and nor were they the polytheists that they should all be killed. Upon that Ali Ibn Abi Talib told him that Magians were also counted as “People of the Book”.</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Persians escaped the slaughter while they were also counted as the “People of the Book”, otherwise they would have also been killed as polytheists.</p>
<p>This shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order to kill the polytheists was not limited to the era of Muhammad (but this order stays true even after his death).</li>
<li>And it was also not limited to only Arabia, but all non-Muslims of the whole world have to be killed by Muslims. </li>
</ul>
<p>Look at this “authentic” tradition of Sunan Abu Dawud (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151001054259/http://dorar.net/h/0916f8e2ca3e8b9006f8ca7e4cf93e8c">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">لم يكن عمر يأخذ الجزية من المجوس حتى شهد عبد الرحمن بن عوف أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذها من مجوس هجر .</blockquote>
<blockquote lang="zxx">Umar Ibn Khattab didn’t want to take Jizya (but wanted to kill them all), but 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf told him that Prophet Muhammad took Jizya from the Zoroastrians of the place of Hijr.</blockquote>
<h2>Present-day Salafis still consider that all polytheists of the whole world should be killed according to the order of verse 9:5</h2>
<p>Saudi Grand Mufti Ibn Baaz wrote (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151001042634/http://www.binbaz.org.sa/node/277">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">، والأرجح أنه لا يلحق بهم غيرهم ، بل هؤلاء الطوائف الثلاث هم الذين يخيرون ؛ لأن الرسول قاتل الكفار في الجزيرة ولم يقبل منهم إلا الإسلام ، <br>Translation:<br>And the correct view is this that polytheists (of today) do not come under the category of “people of the book”, but only Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians are allowed to live by paying Jizya, while Prophet Muhammad killed all the polytheists in Arabia and accepted nothing from them, except Islam.</blockquote>
<p>The largest Salafi Fatwa Website for Muslims, i.e. Islam Question Answers wrote (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34770/there-is-no-compulsion-to-accept-islam">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote lang="zxx">Other scholars said that this (verse of No compulsion in the religion (Quran 2:256) applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad (Quran 9:5). So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people (of book) who may pay jizyah (i.e. Jews/Christian/Zoroastrians). The kuffaar (polytheists) should be compelled to enter Islam if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken, because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Other scholars said that this applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad. So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people who may pay jizyah.<br>
<p>Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood. Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allaah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential, because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued. </p>
<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): </p>
<p>“But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”</p>
<p>[al-Tawbah 9:5]</p>
<p>He did not say, “if they pay the jizyah”. The Jews, Christians and Magians are to be asked to enter Islam; if they refuse then they should be asked to pay the jizyah. If they refuse to pay the jizyah then the Muslims must fight them if they are able to do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): </p>
<p>“Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allaah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger  (Muhammad), (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued”</p>
<p>[al-Tawbah 9:29]</p>
<p>And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted the jizyah from the Magians, but it was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) accepted the jizyah from anyone except the three groups mentioned above. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #169179; background-color: #ecf0f1;"><em><strong>That is why ISIS allowed the Christians of Iraq to pay Jizya and didn’t kill them. But ISIS didn’t accept any Jizya from the Yazidi community of Iraq, and they killed the Yazidi men and took all their women and children as slaves.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>If Shafii, Hanbalis or Salafists of today form an Islamic State/Caliphate today, then again they will start killing all the polytheists and will not accept any Jizya from them. In this regard, there is no difference of opinion between ISIS and the Salafists (and all the followers of Imam Sahafii and Ahmed bin Hanbal). </p>
<h2>Islamic apologists: Verse 9:6 permits to give shelter to Polytheists</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists come up with this excuse today that verse 9:5 didn’t order the killing of all the polytheists, while verse 9:6 allows giving shelter to the polytheists too.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>This excuse is wrong, verse 9:5 is about the polytheists who live within the boundaries of the Islamic State (Dar al-Salam, while verse 9:6 is only about such polytheists who come from the Non-Muslim States (Dar al-Kufr), and thus they have not heard the message of Islam earlier. Therefore, if such polytheists want to hear the message of Islam, then they can be given shelter for a short period temporarily. But after that temporary period, those polytheists should either accept Islam, or return to their respective non-Muslim State, and they are not allowed to permanently live in the Islamic State. According to Muslim Scholars, this temporary period could be from 4 months to one year maximum.</p>

<p>Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of this verse 9:6 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=9&amp;tAyahNo=6&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>

<p>... those who come from a state of non-Muslims, to the area of Islam, delivering a message, for business transactions, to negotiate a peace treaty, to pay the Jizyah, to offer an end to hostilities, and so forth, and request safe passage from Muslim leaders or their deputies, should be granted safe passage, as long as they remain in Muslim areas, until they go back to their land and sanctuary. Scholars say that such a person should not be allowed to stay in Muslim area more than one year. He could stay for four months to one year, and there is a difference between the sayings of Imam Shafii etc. among the Scholars etc.</p>

<h2>Compulsion in Religion: Muhammad compelled the Polytheists to accept Islam or to be killed</h2>
<p>Islamists decieve the world by claiming that there is no COIMPULSION in religion, but hide the fact that Muhammad himself compelled all Polytheists to convert to islam or to be killed. It happened when Muhammad got absolute power and feared no resistance. </p>
<p>After the revelation of verse of the Sword (Quran 9:5), Muhammad send all Arab polytheists a letter/message that after 4 months, either all Polytheists had to convert to Islam, or they would be killed, and they could not stay alive on their polytheism by paying Jizya.</p>
<p>And the excuse was made that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Prophet invited the Arab Polytheists to Islam through a letter/message. In doing so, he made the "Completion of Proof" (Itmam al-Hujjah إتمام الحجة).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arab polytheists had the same Arabic language as the Quran. Thus they were able to understand the MESSAGE clearly. But despite that, when they deny to accept the messages, they deserved to be killed. The non-Arab polytheists didn't get this punishment, while they were not able to understand the message while their language is not Arabic.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is that the existence of Allah has not been proven, yet Islamists have justified killing people in the name of Itmam al-Hujjah (The Completion of Proof) by Allah.</p>
<p>This allows anyone to claim that they are a prophet of Allah, and by simply being present and delivering the message, they have completed the proof (Itmam al-Hujjah). If people do not believe, Allah will bring down punishment through the swords of his followers.</p>
<p>If Allah were to send miraculous punishments such as storms, earthquakes, etc., on those who deny prophethood, it would still make sense because such natural disasters would be "proof" of Allah's existence.</p>
<p>However, the problem is that it has never been proven that Allah has sent any earthquake or punishment on a nation that denied prophethood.</p>
<p>These earthquakes and storms occur to Muslims who confirm prophethood just as they do to non-Muslims. Science has proven that these earthquakes are not due to miracles but occur in regions with fault lines.</p>
<p>Therefore, the occurrence of these earthquakes and natural disasters is not proof of Allah's existence but evidence of Allah's "non-existence."</p>
<p>In simple terms, Islamists make "claims" based on conjecture and then insist that this is a "proof."</p>
<p>Also, understand that it is a contradiction in the Quran to say on one hand "There is no compulsion in religion," and on the other hand, to force people to accept Islam by threatening punishment.</p>
<p>Human reason clearly guides that punishment should have only occurred when disbelievers were oppressing the Muslims (the Prophet).</p>
<p>But this was not the case with the polytheists of Arabia. They were subjugated and in no way oppressing or killing Muslims or the Prophet. So, in this case, forcing them and threatening to kill them with the excuse of punishment to coerce them into accepting Islam is proof of contradictions.</p>
<p>And when the disbelievers were truly oppressing Muslims and the Prophet, Allah was absent, and there was no punishment of any kind (whether in the form of natural disasters or the sword).</p>
<h2>If Umar ibn al-Khattab took 7 years to accept Islam, then how could illiterate and less intelligent Bedouin polytheists believe in just one letter/message?</h2>
<p>Prophet Muhammad preached for 13 years in Mecca, but apart from a few people from his family, tribe, and the people of Mecca, no one believed, even though Muhammad was directly delivering the message to them. Even after the conquest of Mecca in 7 AH, the Quraysh did not believe. Muhammad bribed them and set stipends for them (Mu'allafatu al-Qulub Quran 9:60). But even then, they did not believe. Only after the verse of Sword (Quran 9:t) did they forcibly accept Islam. So, how can it be expected that illiterate and less intelligent Bedouin polytheists would believe in just one letter/message?</p>
<p>Similarly, Umar ibn al-Khattab received the message directly from Muhammad but did not believe for 7 years and was ready to kill Muhammad. So, how can it be expected that illiterate and less intelligent Bedouin polytheists would believe in just one letter/message?</p>
<p>And there were countless polytheists who, based on reasoning, completely rejected Muhammad's claim of prophethood.</p>
<p>Moreover, your human reason will clearly guide you that if understanding the message was the issue, then the Jews and Christians should have understood Muhammad's message first. But isn't it strange that Jews and Christians are allowed to live by paying jizya, while illiterate Bedouin polytheists are to be killed?</p>
<h3>When Islam Was Weak, the Prophet's Job Was Only to "Deliver the Message," Not to Compel, but When Islam Became Powerful, the Prophet's Job Was to "Compel" Too</h3>
<p>In Mecca and the early period in Medina, when Islam was weak and people were not accepting Muhammad's invitation, the Quran's narrative was that the Prophet's job was only to "deliver the message," not to force it upon others because the Prophet is neither a guardian nor a keeper.</p>
<p>See the following verses, all from the Meccan or early Medinan period when Islam was weak:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>O Prophet! Your duty is only to deliver the message, not to make them believe.</strong> (An-Nahl 16:82)</li>
<li><strong>The Prophet cannot compel anyone to guidance.</strong> (28:56)</li>
<li><strong>Do you force people to believe?</strong> (10:99)</li>
<li><strong>The Prophet is not made a guardian over the people.</strong> (17:54)</li>
<li><strong>O Prophet, you are only a warner, and Allah has power over everything.</strong> (Hud 11:12)</li>
<li><strong>Your duty is to deliver the message, and it is Our duty to take account.</strong> (Ar-Ra'd 13:40)</li>
<li><strong>You are not appointed as a guardian over them; your duty is to deliver the message.</strong> (Ash-Shura 42:48)</li>
<li><strong>(The Prophets said) Our duty is only to deliver the message.</strong> (Ya-Sin 36:17)</li>
<li><strong>Admonish, for your duty is only to admonish; you are not a keeper over them.</strong> (Al-Ghashiyah 88:22)</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly, in the early period in Medina, when Islam was weak, the verse came, "There is no compulsion in religion."</p>
<p>But when Islam became powerful in 9 AH and there was no one in Arabia to challenge Islam, Muhammad claimed the revelation of the verse of Qital, after which the Prophet's job now included forcibly making people accept the message and, in case of refusal, to carry out a massacre.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't take the danger of Islam lightly. </li>
<li>Don't let Islamic apologists fool you by presenting Islam as a harmless religion till the time they are weaker than you. </li>
</ul>]]></description>

			<title>Zakir Naik: 80% of the Quran Matches with Science</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/miscellaneous-articles/177-zakir-naik-80-of-the-quran-matches-with-science</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" title="Why Allah put Humans to the Test? An analysis of Zakir Naik's arguments" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIECUxsUPMI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox=""></iframe></p>
<p>Please listen to this video at 10:05, where Zakir Naik is telling that 80% of this Quran is matching 100% with science, while the rest 20% is <strong>AMBIGUOUS</strong>, neither right nor wrong. </p>
<p>And we tell Zakir Naik and Muslims that<strong> the </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>20% ambiguous Quran means that the rest 80% building of Islam is automatically going to collapse</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Please look at the claim of the Quran that its verses are CLEAR, and made EASY to understand. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/54.17">Quran 54:17:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ولقد يسرنا القرآن للذكر فهل من مدكر<br>We have made the Quran easy to understand, but is there anyone who would pay attention?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then this same verse has been repeated multiple times in the Quran (Verses <a href="https://quranx.com/53.22">53:22</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/53.32">53:32</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/53.40">53:40</a>)</p>
<p>And then the Quran claims that its verses are CLEAR.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.1">27:1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> تِلْكَ آيَاتُ الْقُرْآنِ وَكِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ <br>These are the verse of the Koran and a Clear/Manifest Book. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the Quran claims that it was revealed in Arabic language, so then people can understand it. </p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.2">12:2</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ<br>We have revealed it in the Arabic language so that you  would understand it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">So, what is the benefit of revealing it in the Arabic language, when 20% is still ambiguous for Arabic speakers? </p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, as soon as Muslims will claim that 20% of the Quran is ambiguous, then the Quran will automatically become a liar. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, Zakir Naik's claim that 80% of the Quran matches 100% of science, is also wrong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was nothing scientific in the Quran, which was not known by the people of that time. Ancient Roman and Greek scientists told many things about science before Islam. And that scientific stories also reached Syria and other Arab areas through traders. </p>
<p dir="ltr">And Muhammad only copied those old scientific stories in the Quran. Therefore, there is not a single scientific miracle present in the Quran which was not known to the people of that time. </p>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, there were many things in those scientific stories, which were wrong. And Muhammad also copied those wrong scientific things in the Quran too. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Muslim apologists come up with an excuse that Muhammad was illiterate, and thus he was not able to read and copy those scientific stories. But this excuse has no weight, while Muhammad was not <strong>DEAF.</strong> He was indeed able to HEAR those scientific stories, and then tell them to others to write them down in the Quran. Arab people of that era had extraordinary memory, and they were able to memorize large poems word by word, although most of them were totally illiterate. </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An excuse by Muslim apologist:</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">A Muslim apologist came up with this excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Ex-Muslims are taking wrong meaning out of that 20% claim. It only meant that modern science is still limited, and thus it is not able to understand the rest 20% of science that is present in the Quran.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">And we tell them that it is not the case. Science has already reached to that level where it completely refutes all the so-called Quranic miracles. </p>
<p dir="ltr">For example:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The Quran claims that humans are born from gushing <em>water</em> (i.e. sperm), which comes from between the <em>backbone</em> and the ribs. </li>
<li dir="ltr">But science is already in a position to completely refute this Quranic claim. </li>
<li dir="ltr">And it tells that the gushing water (i.e. the sperms) doesn't come out between the backbone and the ribs, but they are produced and come out of the testicles (<a href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Semen_Production_in_the_Quran">link</a>). </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, modern Islam apologists don't claim that modern science is wrong about testicles. But they come up with excuses that the Quranic verse didn't mean that, but it meant that and that and that (i.e. several meanings). </p>
<p>But when they come up with several new (and again mutually contradictory) meanings of the Quranic verse, then it proves only that the verses of the Quran are neither clear nor easy to understand. </p>

			<title>Zakir Naik: Homosexuality begins when you violate the rule of Hijab</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/226-zakir-naik-homosexuality</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/lgbtq/226-zakir-naik-homosexuality</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Zakir Naik claims two reasons for becoming homosexual:</p>
<ol>
<li>Homosexuality starts when you break the rule of Hijab. If you maintain Hijab, it will never happen</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">If you sleep with 20, 30, 40 or more women, you get tired and become homosexual.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please watch this video of Zakir Naik:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrh5fyjKtFY?start=26" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Response:</span></strong></p>
<p>Zakir Naik is absolutely wrong on all accounts.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Firstly:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>It were Sahaba and Jihadists (including Muhammad) who slept with 10, 20, 30 or more women (wives, captive and slave women). </li>
<li>And Muhammad himself broke the rule of Hijab when he prohibited slave women to take Hijab. And Umar ibn Khattab used to beat slave women for taking HIjab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by taking Hijab. And Muhammad even kept the chests of slave women naked. Yes, there were thousands of slave women present in public with naked breasts in Islamic countries. For details, please read this article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/women-and-hijab/11-islam-prohibited-hijab-for-slave-women-and-kept-their-breasts-naked"> Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, as Islam prohibited Slave Women from taking Hijab or even covering their naked breasts in public </a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Secondly:</strong></span></p>
<p>You will most probably become an old man till you are finished having sex with 40 or 50 women. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Scientific studies showed that gender dysphoria has nothing to do with having sex with 20, 30, 40 or 50 women, but a majority of homosexuals had it since their childhood. </p>
<p>For example, this scientific study <a class="content-link css-g0xkld" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2762788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="css-1qoyvah icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted Source</span></span></a> showed that, on average, study participants reported their <strong>earliest memory of gender dysphoria</strong> between the ages of <strong>4 and 6 years old</strong>. <strong>By the age of 7</strong>, most study participants could remember experiencing some feelings of gender dysphoria.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Homosexuality does not start due to breaking the rule of Hijab, otherwise there were thousands of slave women present in Islamic societies with naked breasts (including in front of Muhammad). Moreover, we see homosexual activities in great numbers in Islamic Madrassas too, where either women are totally absent, or even if present, then they are in Hijab. </li>
<li>And scientific studies are witness that homosexuality has nothing to do with sleeping with 20, 30, 40 or 50 women. </li>
<li>Zakir Naik is a dishonest person, who spreads hatred against homosexuals through telling lies. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<p>Please also don't forget:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Muslim man used to rape a slave woman. And after fulfilling his lust (in a Shia Mut'ah-type TEMPORARY sexual relationship), he sold her to another master, and for himself, he used to buy a new slave girl from the Islamiy Bazaar of slavery. In this way, a single slave woman was raped by multiple Muslim men one by one (or in other words, a Muslim man used to rape multiple slave women one by one due to the evil of temporary sexual relationships in Islamic Sharia). </li>
<li>If a Muslim master got lust for the slave wife of his male slave, then he was allowed to separate her from his male slave and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, she could be returned to her slave husband. </li>
<li>And Muslim men used to SWAP their slave girls with each other. This swapping allowed them to rape the slave girls of each other legally.</li>
<li>And Muslim men had dozens to hundreds of slave women present in their Harems. </li>
</ul>
<p>For proof, please read this article: <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/islamic-slavery/47-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity">Part 1: Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity</a></p>
<p>Moreover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad had 11 to 13 wives. </li>
<li>He also had multiple slave women.</li>
<li>Muhammad always got huge spoils of war due to Khums. Alone in one battle of Khaibar, he got 7 slave women, whom he traded for a single beautiful Safiyyah (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/16/102">Sahih Muslim 1365e</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

			<title>Zamzam Water:  Miracles or Deceptions?</title>
			<link>https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/208-zamzam-water-miracles-or-deceptions</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/208-zamzam-water-miracles-or-deceptions</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Islamic preachers claim many miracles about Zamzam water. Let us see if they are real miracles or only deceptions by Islamic preachers. </p>
<p>First of all, Zakir Naik claims (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zakirnaikofficial/photos/a.150461375036187/528099710605683/?__tn__=%2CO*F">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">... So they pumped 690 Millions liters of Zam Zam in 24 hours, but it was re-supplied in 11 minutes only. There are 2 miracles here, the first that Zam Zam was re-filled immediately, &amp; the second is that Allah Holds the extra-ordinarily powerful Aquifer for not throwing extra Zam Zam out of the well, otherwise the world will SINK.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The water in Zamzam’s well in Mecca is not depleted because it is an aquifer, and its reservoir is connected to renewable groundwater (which ultimately replenishes from rainwater in the valley and the surrounding hills).</p>
<p>The city of Mecca is located in a valley, which is surrounded by hills. And Masjid-ul-Haram (and the well of Zamzam) is the LOWEST point in this valley. The well of Zamzam is about 40 to 50 feet deep from the level of water in the surrounding hills. This causes the water of the whole valley and the surrounding hilly areas to move towards the Zamzam reservoir (<a href="https://ur.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%B2%D9%85">link)</a>. </p>
<p>There are hundreds of such aquifers present in the world, with a huge amount of water. Some of them have so much water that it comes out as streams and springs. Although Zamzam also has a lot of water, it cannot be compared in size and volume to many of those other aquifers, while no water streams or springs flow from it, but it is only a "Well". And Saudi Government has to put in huge pumps in order to take water out of it. And Saudi government also has to regulate its consumption. </p>
<p>Thus, although Zamzam is ONLY a well (and does not even have enough water for springs and streams), still Zakir Naik claims that Allah has stopped Zamzam to overflow, otherwise it will sink the entire world while it has an indefinite amount of water. And the most unfortunate thing is that Muslim preachers like Zakir Naik are still able to deceive millions of innocent people, by fooling them with such lies. </p>
<p>Please think about it, if Zamzam really had an indefinite amount of water, then the whole of Mecca would be full of greenery, and Saudi Government would have used it for establishing green farmlands and cultivation around Mecca. </p>
<h2>Muhammad's fantasy stories about the sweet water of the Nile and the Euphrates </h2>
<p>Muslim preachers, like Zakir Naik, are only making such stories on their own while they know that their followers are ignorant, and will not catch their false stories. </p>
<p>And the same was the case with Muhammad too. Please read the following Ahadith. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3207">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3207</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said: .... (On the night of ascension, where he went to heavens) Then I was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, <em><strong>and four rivers originated at its root</strong></em>, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, 'The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the <em><strong>Nile and the Euphrates</strong></em>.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2839">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2839:</a></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: <em><strong>Saihan, Jaihan</strong></em>, <em><strong>Euphrates and Nile</strong></em> are all among the rivers of Paradise.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The people of that era didn't know about the sources of water in rivers. Thus, Muhammad made up fantasy stories that sweet water in these two rivers comes directly from the heavens. And unfortunately, billions of Muslims become fools and believe in such fantasy stories of Muhammad, instead of challenging him. </p>
<p>Now, these Ahadith became a headache for Islamic apologists, as they fit in none of the cosmological models. They are unable to answer how water, which is coming out of the root of a Tin the paradise, lands on the earth.</p>
<p>But this issue was also solved when we find the same story in the bible too (nevertheless, a little different concept).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:10-2:14">Genesis 2:10-14</a>: <span id="en-NIV-41" class="text Gen-2-10">A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into <em><strong>four</strong></em> headwaters.</span><span id="en-NIV-42" class="text Gen-2-11"><sup class="versenum"> </sup>The name of the first is the <strong>Pishon </strong>۔۔۔</span><span id="en-NIV-44" class="text Gen-2-13">The name of the second river is the <em><strong>Gihon</strong></em>; it winds through the entire land of Cush. </span><span id="en-NIV-45" class="text Gen-2-14">The name of the third river is the <strong>Tigris</strong>; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the <strong>Euphrates</strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference between the story of the Bible, and the story of Muhammad is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The '<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden"><em><strong>Garden of Eden</strong></em></a>' (The paradise, where God kept Adam and Eve and the forbidden tree) <em><strong>was present <span style="color: #ff0000;">on the earth</span></strong></em> in the story of the bible. Thus, it was not a problem when the bible claimed that the water of Tigris and Ecomesates come from the 'Garden of Eden'.</li>
<li>But Muhammad made a mistake while copying the story of the bible, and he claimed that Adam and Eve and the forbidden tree <em><strong>were NOT present on the earth, but in paradise <span style="color: #ff0000;">in the heavens</span></strong></em>. Thus, it became a problem to explain how the water from the root of a tree in heaven, lands in the rivers on the earth. </li>
</ul>
<p>Muhammad was copying the stories of the bible, but he was still very much illiterate and not a scholar. Thus, he made a lot of <em><strong>human mistakes</strong></em> while copying those older stories. </p>
<p><strong>More about the Garden of Eden/Paradise:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden">https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden</a></p>

</blockquote>
<h2>Muslim Preachers: Zamzam was discovered 2600 years before Muhammad by Hajar and Ismael</h2>
<p>This story is also false. </p>
<p>Actually, the whole story of Ibrahim and Hajar and Ismael coming to Mecca is false and only an invention of Muhammad himself. Muhammad invented this story, in order to get importance among Jews and Christians for being a descendant of Ibrahim. </p>
<p>The Quraysh (and all other Arabs) had no idea that they were from the progeny of Ismael/Ibrahim, and Kaba has anything to do with Ibrahim, or Zamzam was discovered by Hajar, etc. Muhammad was the first one who invented all those stories and told them to Quraysh/Arabs. </p>

<p>It is a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Very, Very</strong><strong> Important </strong></span>issue, and those who want to search for the truth, have to read all the facts on the above-mentioned website. It exposes completely all these false stories by Muhammad. <span style="color: #0f00ff;"><strong>Please,</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #0f00ff;">don't miss reading articles on this website (unfortunately, many of us are totally unaware of these important facts)</span></strong>. </p>
<p>The Quraysh knew very well that the well of Zamzam was discovered only 40 years before the birth of Muhammad, by his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib. Even Islamic traditions also recorded it. Nevertheless, Muslim preachers came up with another fantasy story that Zamzam was actually discovered by Hajar, but then one tribe closed it and made it hidden from others. And it stayed hidden for centuries (or thousands of years) till Abdul Mutalib again discovered it. </p>
<p>But how is it possible?</p>
<p>According to stories by Muhammad, initially, all Arabs were monotheists, and they were visiting Kaba for Hajj every year, and they were drinking water from Zamzam for centuries. How can then a tribe close and hide it, when thousands of Arabs knew exactly where it was situated (near Kaba) and drank water from it every year?</p>
<p>Naturally, Islamic preachers have no answer to this. </p>
<h2>Zamzam was full of SNAKES till Muhammad ordered to kill them</h2>
<p>Today, Muslim preachers deceive people by telling them miracles of Zamzam water like it has supernatural healing effects and (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200801183358/https://www.arabnews.com/node/1712901/saudi-arabia">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The well’s ever-clean water has no moss, insects, fungus, or any other impurities. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the truth is, there are poisonous elements present in Zamzam water (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-13267205">BBC Report)</a>. Please also read a detailed report on <a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Drinking_Zamzam_Water_and_its_Health_Risks">WikiIslam about Zamzam water</a>. </p>
<p>Moreover, Zamzam was full of snakes until Muhammad ordered their killing. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5251">Sunan Abi Dawud, 5251</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Al-Abbas said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): We wish to sweep out Zamzam, but in it there are some of these Jinnan, meaning small snakes; so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered that they should be killed.</p>
<p>Grade: <strong>Sahih</strong> (Albani)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muslim preachers also don't tell why there were snakes in Zamzam. </p>
<p>While Pagans of Mecca also consider snakes to be one of their gods (just like Hindus consider snakes to be gods and worship them). Imam Tabari wrote that pagans of Mecca used to worship snakes in Zamzam, and used to give presents to them. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230307184726/http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/the-small-hajj-called-umra">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was also a serpent in the Kaabah, which lived in the well of the temple where the worshippers threw their gifts.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/the-small-hajj-called-umra#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[<em>Tarikh al-Tabari</em>, I, page 525</a>]  The serpents were considered by the Arabians to be Jinn and devils.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/the-small-hajj-called-umra#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[<em>Taj Al Aruss</em>, I, pages 147 and 284</a>] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abdul Muttalib, who discovered the well of Zamzam, was himself an idol-worshipper, and he tried to sacrifice his son Abdullah (the father of Muhammad) for the sake of his idol gods. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008022324/http://www.brotherpete.com/index.php?topic=1784.msg7346">Link</a>). </p>
<h2>Why Don't Islamic Preachers Confirm the Healing Miracles of Zamzam Through Scientific Studies?</h2>
<p>Muhammad claimed many health benefits from Zamzam water. For instance, he claimed that drinking only Zamzam water for 30 days would cause weight gain.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2473a">Sahih Muslim, 2473a</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Dharr, who had stayed near the Ka’bah and its coverings for forty days and nights with no food or drink other than (Zamzam): “How long have you been here?” Abu Dharr said: “I have been here for <strong>thirty days and nights</strong>.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Who has been feeding you?” <strong>He said, “I have had nothing but <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1698">Zamzam water</a>, and I have gotten so fat that I have folds of fat on my stomach</strong>. I do not feel any of the tiredness or weakness of hunger and I have not become thin.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily, it is blessed, it is food that nourishes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, Islamic preachers repeat Muhammad's claims and attribute various health benefits to Zamzam water. However, they fail to back up their assertions with scientific evidence. They do not conduct scientific studies to verify Muhammad's claims about Zamzam's ability to cure diseases and alleviate hunger.</p>
<p>But why? Why do Islamic preachers refrain from proving their prophet's statements through scientific research? Is it because they fear that scientific studies might disprove their prophet's claims instead of validating them? If these studies were to confirm Zamzam's therapeutic properties, everyone would embrace Islam. On the other hand, if no such effects are found, Islamic preachers must cease spreading false tales and leave Islam altogether.</p>
<p>Think about it - if Zamzam truly possessed healing qualities against sickness and starvation, wouldn't Saudi Arabian hospitals be unnecessary?</p>

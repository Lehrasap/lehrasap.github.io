		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;No sane person can accept that there should be a death penalty for changing religion. Thus Islamic apologists fabricated a lame excuse, where they started claiming:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The act of apostasy in Islam can be seen as equivalent to committing treason against a modern-day state. Just as a state would punish its citizens who support its enemies and betray the constitution, Islamic law also provides consequences for those who abandon the religion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to distinguish between two types of laws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;State Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Personal Beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State laws regulate &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERACTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between individuals and are applicable when two or more people have to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with each other. On the other hand, personal beliefs pertain to an individual's values, and practices, and are not concerned with &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dealings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic apologist's argument that apostasy in Islam is equivalent to committing treason against a modern-day state is flawed because it blurs the line between state laws and personal beliefs. While a state may punish its citizens for supporting its enemies or betraying the constitution, religious beliefs and affiliations fall under personal values. The decision to change one's religion is a matter between an individual and their deity, and does not involve any harm or injury to others (i.e. it does not deal with other individuals). Therefore, it is not possible for the state to impose penalties for apostasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Islamic apologists are trying to impose those non-human laws today, against which their own Prophets REBELLED. Yes, Muhammad himself rebelled against his own community and he called their idol Gods to be false deities and refused to follow them. Yes, Ibrahim himself broke the idol gods of his community. Why didn’t then Muhammad and Ibrahim become worthy to be killed for APOSTASY? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Instead of calling Muhammad and Ibrahim to be TRAITORS and worthy of being killed, Islamic apologists start presenting them as innocent oppressed (مظلوم) figures, and pagans as tyrants (ظالم), while they tried to stop them from criticizing their gods. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These are only Double Standards of Muslim apologists. Islam itself started following the Sunnah of Pagans in this case (actually, much worse as pagans didn’t kill him or other Muslim converts, but they only tried to stop them from criticizing their gods, which was itself a wrong thing to do). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Analysis of the Arguments of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58VckD6RoEA&amp;amp;t=9s&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Muslim Lantern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Muslim Lantern is also a famous Islamic apologist. He presented the following excuses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/58VckD6RoEA?t=9s&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The First Excuse: Democracy Allows the Majority to Make Any Law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent video, The Muslim Lantern presented the argument that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liberals believe in democracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democracy allows the majority to establish any rule for their state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, it is hypocritical for liberals to criticize the decision of a Muslim majority in an Islamic state to enact apostasy laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims like The Muslim Lantern either misunderstand the Western system or deliberately misrepresent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the Western system is not primarily based on democracy but on &lt;strong&gt;secularism.&lt;/strong&gt; Democracy is merely a branch of secularism and cannot override core secular values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are these secular values? Understand that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secularism is a system that prioritizes humanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It respects all individuals, regardless of their religion, race, or language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It guarantees &lt;strong&gt;equal human rights&lt;/strong&gt; to all its citizens, irrespective of their religion or race or language, or irrespective of being from a majority group or a minority group. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, humanity within us is ENOUGH to guide us towards what is right and what is wrong. Thus, BASIC Human Rights are primary issues, and they are not based  upon the dictatorship of majority, but they are based upon the guidance of humanity. The majority decision in democracy is only limited to 'secondary' issues which we have to solve in our daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, in a secular system, the majority does not have the right to infringe upon the equal rights of minorities. This is why, in a true secular society, it would be impossible for a majority to pass unjust laws like the apostasy laws seen in many Islamic countries, where the majority acts as a dictator and unilaterally strips non-Muslim minorities of their right to change their religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Excuse: An Open Apostate Incites Others to Commit Crimes Like Stealing and Drinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument from The Muslim Lantern is completely baseless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An open apostate does not incite others to commit crimes like stealing or killing. As for drinking alcohol, it is the right of non-Muslims, just as Indian Muslims have the right to eat meat in a predominantly Hindu country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expressing one's religious beliefs or ideology to others is not &lt;strong&gt;INCITEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;; it is known as &lt;strong&gt;PREACHING&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preaching is a fundamental human right that falls under freedom of expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are simply double standards on the part of some Muslims, who call it preaching when they do it but label it incitement when non-Muslims do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: Was Muhammad preaching to the Meccan pagans, or was he inciting them? Were the Meccans justified in torturing and killing Muslims simply because they were preaching Islam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is, Islamic apologists have not way to escape, except for showing Double Standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Analysis of Daniel Haqiqatjou's Arguments:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video of Daniel where he is defending the Islamic Apostasy Law of killing people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Xrep03qSRs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All his justifications for killing apostates (i.e., those leaving Islam) hinge on the argument that colonizers also restricted freedom of speech and punished those who spoke against the Crown and the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are two major flaws in Daniel's reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, what colonizers did was based on &quot;State Law&quot; and concerned matters between individuals and the state. In contrast, colonizers did not execute people for changing their personal religious beliefs, as these beliefs do not constitute treason against the state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, even the colonizers' &quot;State Laws&quot; were flawed, which is why modern secular states have abolished those barbaric practices and now allow criticism of both state laws and the crown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with Islam is its rigidity and inability to reform. It turned a personal matter into a state crime and shows no capacity to correct this mistake. Muslims are forced to live with these severe errors in Islamic law, as they cannot alter Sharia rulings on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Sharia orders Muslims if any non-Muslim state does not allow Muslims to preach Islam, and to let people convert to Islam, then it becomes &lt;strong&gt;obligatory&lt;/strong&gt; for Muslims to wage war against that non-Muslim state (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/85662/restrictions-placed-by-muslims-on-non-muslims-etc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, the questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should non-Muslims today also wage a war against Islamic countries and punish them for not allowing non-Muslims to preach and to let people leave Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And why should non-Muslim states today allow Muslims to immigrate in their countries, instead of waging a war against them? And why should they allow Muslims to preach and let people convert to Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple words, Muslim excuses of treason etc. are not correct, and Islamic Sharia is only based upon&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Double Standards, Hypocrisy, and the rule of Might is Right&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Analysis of Zakir Naik's Argument:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGHHx0q4MA8&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To paraphrase Dr Zakir Naiks answer to this direct question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teaching about Islam is like teaching people 2+2=4. Now with that in mind should we allow people to teach to people 2+2=5? We know islam is true, so why should we allow anyone to teach something that is not true. Nobody would allow anyone to teach to people 2+2=5. So why should we allow people to teach other religions than islam knowing they are all untrue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no PROOF that 80% of the world's population (i.e. non-Muslims) is making the mistake of 2+2=5. It is equally possible that these are Muslims who are making the mistake of 2+2=5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't it your own Quran that says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.111&quot;&gt;2:111&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;قُلْ هَاتُوا۟ بُرْهَٰنَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Say, 'Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Zakir Naik is not providing proof; he is &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; making an &lt;strong&gt;empty CLAIM&lt;/strong&gt; that all non-Muslims are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we ask Zakir Naik and his followers: Where is the proof?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since no one truly knows if there is a god (or gods) in the heavens, everyone has the right to &quot;bring their proof.&quot; If the evidence presented by Muslims holds any weight, then non-Muslims will naturally accept Islam. Conversely, if the evidence goes against Islam, people will naturally leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if 80% of the world’s population (i.e., non-Muslims) also made an empty claim that Islam is false and that Muslims are teaching 2+2=5? Does this give them the right to ban the preaching of Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, why do Islamic apologists want to apply double standards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Zakir Naik's argument about treason, we've already addressed it: it's a weak excuse. Religious beliefs fall under &quot;personal values and practices,&quot; not &quot;state laws,&quot; and therefore cannot be considered treason against the state.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Story of the Bloodthirsty WOLF and the LAMB: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Do you remember that story where the wolf kept on making lame excuses one by one, that the lamb was making his drinking water dirty, or he abused him last year, or it was his father who abused him. And at the end, the wolf killed the lamb on the basis of those lies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Muslim apologists are exactly those bloodthirsty wolves. They will tell every type of lie and make every type of lame excuse in order to achieve their wicked plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Islamophobia_is_wolfophobia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Islamophobia is equal to Wolfophobia&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/Islamophobia_is_wolfophobia.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Apostate_Death_Punishment.jpg&quot;&gt;In Image Format&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;No sane person can accept that there should be a death penalty for changing religion. Thus Islamic apologists fabricated a lame excuse, where they started claiming:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The act of apostasy in Islam can be seen as equivalent to committing treason against a modern-day state. Just as a state would punish its citizens who support its enemies and betray the constitution, Islamic law also provides consequences for those who abandon the religion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to distinguish between two types of laws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;State Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Personal Beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State laws regulate &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERACTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between individuals and are applicable when two or more people have to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with each other. On the other hand, personal beliefs pertain to an individual's values, and practices, and are not concerned with &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dealings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic apologist's argument that apostasy in Islam is equivalent to committing treason against a modern-day state is flawed because it blurs the line between state laws and personal beliefs. While a state may punish its citizens for supporting its enemies or betraying the constitution, religious beliefs and affiliations fall under personal values. The decision to change one's religion is a matter between an individual and their deity, and does not involve any harm or injury to others (i.e. it does not deal with other individuals). Therefore, it is not possible for the state to impose penalties for apostasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Muslim Lantern is also a famous Islamic apologist. He presented the following excuses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Sharia orders Muslims if any non-Muslim state does not allow Muslims to preach Islam, and to let people convert to Islam, then it becomes &lt;strong&gt;obligatory&lt;/strong&gt; for Muslims to wage war against that non-Muslim state (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/85662/restrictions-placed-by-muslims-on-non-muslims-etc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, the questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should non-Muslims today also wage a war against Islamic countries and punish them for not allowing non-Muslims to preach and to let people leave Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And why should non-Muslim states today allow Muslims to immigrate in their countries, instead of waging a war against them? And why should they allow Muslims to preach and let people convert to Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple words, Muslim excuses of treason etc. are not correct, and Islamic Sharia is only based upon&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Double Standards, Hypocrisy, and the rule of Might is Right&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Analysis of Zakir Naik's Argument:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGHHx0q4MA8&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To paraphrase Dr Zakir Naiks answer to this direct question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teaching about Islam is like teaching people 2+2=4. Now with that in mind should we allow people to teach to people 2+2=5? We know islam is true, so why should we allow anyone to teach something that is not true. Nobody would allow anyone to teach to people 2+2=5. So why should we allow people to teach other religions than islam knowing they are all untrue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no PROOF that 80% of the world's population (i.e. non-Muslims) is making the mistake of 2+2=5. It is equally possible that these are Muslims who are making the mistake of 2+2=5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't it your own Quran that says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.111&quot;&gt;2:111&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;قُلْ هَاتُوا۟ بُرْهَٰنَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Say, 'Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Zakir Naik is not providing proof; he is &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; making an &lt;strong&gt;empty CLAIM&lt;/strong&gt; that all non-Muslims are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we ask Zakir Naik and his followers: Where is the proof?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since no one truly knows if there is a god (or gods) in the heavens, everyone has the right to &quot;bring their proof.&quot; If the evidence presented by Muslims holds any weight, then non-Muslims will naturally accept Islam. Conversely, if the evidence goes against Islam, people will naturally leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if 80% of the world’s population (i.e., non-Muslims) also made an empty claim that Islam is false and that Muslims are teaching 2+2=5? Does this give them the right to ban the preaching of Islam?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, why do Islamic apologists want to apply double standards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Zakir Naik's argument about treason, we've already addressed it: it's a weak excuse. Religious beliefs fall under &quot;personal values and practices,&quot; not &quot;state laws,&quot; and therefore cannot be considered treason against the state.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Story of the Bloodthirsty WOLF and the LAMB: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Do you remember that story where the wolf kept on making lame excuses one by one, that the lamb was making his drinking water dirty, or he abused him last year, or it was his father who abused him. And at the end, the wolf killed the lamb on the basis of those lies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Muslim apologists are exactly those bloodthirsty wolves. They will tell every type of lie and make every type of lame excuse in order to achieve their wicked plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;Muslim Apologists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://muslimskeptic.com/author/drjou/&quot;&gt;Daniel Haquiqajou&lt;/a&gt; come up with excuses like (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Video link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marriage and sex with 9 years old pre-pubescent girl was a 'tradition' of that era. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vast majority of history, life expectancy was relatively low. Moreover, infant mortality was considerably high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, it was then necessary to use the extent of the 'fertility window' for reproduction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is why Islam didn't prohibit this practice, but the prophet Muhammad himself married a 9 years old 'Aisha. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam let even a breastfed girl be wed and used as a sex object. This has absolutely nothing to do with the excuse of “reproduction” that Islam apologists like Daniel Haquiqajou make. This Islamic ruling is purely for the benefit and pleasure of old men, while Islam didn't respect the rights of girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;'Aisha was wed to Muhammad at the age of 6 years when she was not even able to give her consent. Yes, Abu Bakr didn't have to ask her about her consent, but he directly married her to Muhammad. Later, at the age of 9 years, she was sent to Muhammad's home for the consummation of the marriage. But it is not necessary for Islamic Sharia to wait till the age of 9 years to send the minor girl to her husband's house, but she could be sent to him even if she is a breastfed baby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Actually, Muslim men were buying small slave child-girls from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, and then using them for sexual pleasures. It happened due to another evil of Islamic slavery, where Islam allowed the owners to separate the children from their slave parents, and sell them in the Bazaars of slavery when they got 2 teeth (i.e. at the age of 6 months). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, there are authentic reports that companions of Muhammad not only used to rape captive women, but also captive pre-pubescent minor girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism, and wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1799_%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%AC-%D9%A8/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_53&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself. As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read our detailed article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=71&amp;amp;catid=27&quot;&gt;Islam: Even a breastfed baby Girl can be married and used for sexual pleasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Furthermore,&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; Human nature dictates that as boys and girls reach adulthood, they naturally experience feelings of love. However, Islam denies girls the right to freely fall in love with a boy of their choice. They can be married off to older men, depriving them of the opportunity to develop natural affection for someone their age. If they dare to follow their heart and develop feelings for a boy of their choice, they may face severe consequences such as beatings or even death, all in the name of terms like modesty, decency, adultery, or Ghairah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000dff;&quot;&gt;Extreme Dangers&lt;/span&gt; for teen mothers and their babies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;1. Science says 25-30 is the age of least risk to mother and child for a first pregnancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;With the onset of puberty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory essentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology around the age of 25–30 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2.. The younger the mother, the greater the risk. Childbearing in adolescents aged 12–15 years in low resource countries: a neglected issue. New estimates from demographic and household surveys in 42 countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;It is frequently cited that girls who give birth aged 15–19 are more than twice as likely to die as those in their 20s (1, 2). However, this fails to capture the fact that risk increases with decreasing age. ......girls aged 15 or under had an odds ratio for maternal death four times higher than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;3. It is not just mortality, it's fistulas. Science says it is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;4. Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The women and girls who do survive often develop fistulas, which are holes between the vaginal wall and the rectum or bladder. When the baby's head pushes down and gets stuck, it can cut portions of the mother's soft tissue between its skull and her pelvic bones. As a result, the tissue dies, and a hole forms. Faeces and urine then leak through the hole and out of the vagina. Women with fistulas are often divorced and shunned. And young girls are at higher risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0006ff;&quot;&gt;Even if they survive&lt;/span&gt;, still the Children of teen mothers suffer &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;dreadful health problems their entire life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;High mortality rate among babies from teen mothers is not the only problem, they also suffer from other horrific health problems too their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children of teen mothers are at higher risk of intellectual, language, and socio-emotional delays.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Day_2009_30-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Day_2009-30&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;One study suggested that adolescent mothers are less likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Stimulation&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation&quot;&gt;stimulate&lt;/a&gt; their infant through &lt;a title=&quot;Affection&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection&quot;&gt;affectionate behaviors&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a title=&quot;Haptic communication&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_communication&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Smile&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile&quot;&gt;smiling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&quot;Linguistics&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics&quot;&gt;verbal communication&lt;/a&gt;, or to be &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sensitivity (human)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_(human)&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Acceptance&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance&quot;&gt;accepting&lt;/a&gt; toward their needs.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Sentence (law)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)&quot;&gt;serve time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title=&quot;Prison&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-37&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-37&quot;&gt;[37]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Intense opposition to the marriage of young girls is brought in the name of R. Shimon bar Yohai, that “Whoever marries off his daughter when she is young minimizes the bearing of children and loses his money and comes to bloodshed.”5 5. Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, Version II, ch. 48, p. 66. The concern is that the young girl may become pregnant and die as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;500 years before Muhammed, doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soranus_of_Ephesus&quot;&gt;Soranus&lt;/a&gt; wrote his book about gynaecology and in hit he stated that women could be considered fit for conception from 15. 15 is significantly older than 9. Soranus was from Ephesos and worked in Alexandria before he moved to Rome. So he had met desert-conditions girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soranus wrote in his book of gynaecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/book/2189958/9b5cce/soranus-gynecology.html&quot;&gt;Soranus, Of Ephesus and Owsei Temkin (1994) &lt;em&gt;Soranus’ gynecology&lt;/em&gt;. Baltimore Johns Hopkins Univ. Press.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 233):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book about gynecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &quot;For it obtains whenever women married before maturity conceive and give birth while the uterus has not yet fully grown nor the fundus of (the) uterus expanded.&quot; So they knew the pelvic floor and birth canal were not mature enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 227)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... difficult labor occur in those who give birth in a way which is contrary to nature? Diocles the Caerystan in the second book on gynecology says that primiparae and young women have difficult labor&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Recognize Those Capable of Conception:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since women usually are married for the sake of children and succession and not for mere enjoyment and since it is utterly absurd to make inquiries about the excellence of their lineage and the abundance of their means but to leave unexamined whether they can conceive or not and whether they are fit for childbearing or not it is only right for us to give an account of the matter in question One must judge the majority from the ages of 15 to 40 to be fit for conception&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here was the law in the Roman Empire before Muhammad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/146/abstract/roman-law-and-marriage-underage-girls&quot;&gt;Roman Law and the Marriage of Underage Girls&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;Twelve will seem to us undesirably young, and indeed ancient doctors such as Soranus warned against the dangers of women becoming sexually active at so early an age. Most Roman women appear to have married later, from about 15 to 20. But the possibility of efarlier marriage we know to have been actively pursued especially in upper-class families, where marriage often assisted dynastic alliances.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Sparta:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In fact, Sparta raised the marriage age from 18 to 20 with the primary aim of decreasing the number of sickly children. As a result, they observed an increase in life expectancy for women, which began to rival that of men. It became evident that child marriage was the main contributing factor to mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While Athenian women might have expected to marry for the first time around the &lt;strong&gt;age of fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; to men much older than them, Spartan women normally married between the ages of eighteen and twenty to men close to them in age.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-FOOTNOTECartledge198194–95_29-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTECartledge198194%E2%80%9395-29&quot;&gt;[29]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Spartan ideology, the primary role of adult women was to bear and raise healthy children. This focus on childbearing was likely responsible for the emphasis on physical fitness in Spartan women, as it was believed that physically stronger women would have healthier children.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlundell1995157-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bearing and raising children was considered the most important role for women in Spartan society; equal to male warriors in the Spartan army.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-50&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-50&quot;&gt;[50]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Spartan women were encouraged to produce many children, preferably male, to increase Sparta's military population. They took pride in having borne and raised brave warriors.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-51&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-51&quot;&gt;[51]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hence, even with an emphasis on bearing numerous children, Sparta raised the age of marriage for women to 18–20 years. Interestingly, this decision did not hinder Spartan women from having many children. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in the mortality rate among both mothers and children. Additionally, this measure curbed the birth of weak offspring prone to diseases. As a result, only healthy and robust children were born, growing up to become outstanding warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&quot;text-24 xs:text-20&quot;&gt;Laws at the time of Muhammed.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two dominant neighbouring empires had already prohibited intercourse with 9 years old girls before Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ijtihadnet.com/wp-content/uploads/Minor-Marriage-in-Early-Islamic-Law.pdf&quot;&gt; Laws at the time of Muhammed Minor Marriage in Early Islamic Law, Carolyn G. Baugh, LEIDEN | BOSTON, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although investigation into Sasanian-era (224â€“651 CE) child marriage prac-tices unearths scant information, the age of twelve is again important for girls. According to the Avesta, the age of majority was clearly set at fifteen for boys as well as girls; Middle Persian civil law allowed marriage at age nine, provided that consummation wait until age twelve.[24]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byzantine law required that a girl attain the age of thirteen before contract-ing a marriage. Whether she would have consented to the marriage or not prior to this age is deemed immaterial as she would have no legally viable consent to give.[22] All parties to a marriage needed to issue consent, including the groom, the bride, and her parents. In cases where a girl consented to intercourse prior to marriage it was assumed that she consented to the marriage itself and the families would then arrange it. However, if that intercourse occurred prior to the age of thirteen, the groom would meet with the law’s most serious punish-ments due to the girl’s assumed legal inability to consent.[23]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Muhammed it was known to be injurious to girls to engage in very early intercourse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Consequences of Child Marriage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modem Medicine shows that childbirth for females below the age of seventeen and â€¢ above forty leads to &lt;strong&gt;greater maternal mortality as well as infant mortality&lt;/strong&gt; (London  1992, 501). It must he made clear that although conditions commonly associated with poverty, e.g. malnutrition, poor physical health and other negative circumstances may contribute to difficult births and bad health for young mothers, consistent findings indicate that the age factor plays a significant role by itself. &quot;Even under the best of modern conditions, women who give birth before the age of seventeen have a higher mortality rate than older women. The closer a woman is to menarche, &lt;strong&gt;the greater the risk to both mother and child, as well as to the mother's future child bearing capabilities, for the reproductive system has not completely matured when ovulation begins&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. (Demand 1994, 102).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem seen more often among underprivileged women is that they develop **fistulae which is often due to the pelvis not having fully formed. This can be caused by a complicated pregnancy or having intercourse at a very young age.**28. This leads the girl or woman to have permanent damage and often she is shunned by her family and community (4). Although such a condition is preventable it requires a good health service and communications systems (S). Unfortunately, these are often not available in impoverished areas of the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge of medical complications involved with early marriage cannot be considered &quot;new&quot; findings. Ancient and Medieval Medicine texts indicate that doctors were well aware of the physical harm posed to girls by early marriages and pregnancies&lt;/strong&gt;. â€¦â€¦..In fact, not only doctors of Medicine but other scholars in Most societies had a clear understanding that intercourse should not take place before the menarche. &lt;strong&gt;Hesiod suggested marriage in the fifth year after puberty, or age nineteen, and Plato in the Laws mandated from sixteen to twenty years of age, and in the Republic he gave the age as twenty. Aristotle specifically warned against early childbearing for women as a cause of small and weak infants and difficult and dangerous labor for the mother, and the Spartans avoided it for just those reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; (Demand 1994, 102)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)” is supposedly accepted and safe&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Then Muslim preacher Daniel mentions “evolutionary adaptive”, and claims that academics agree with him that “Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)” is supposedly accepted and safe. And as proof, he put the “Bruce Rind Study”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But it was again a deception by Daniel on many accounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Rind Study was not about the reproduction of children, which is the main argument by Muslims for early marriages of prepubescent girls in order to defend Islam. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Rind Study was only limited to 'long term effects' upon children, who were raped. It concluded that there were no significant long-term effects found in children, who were abused. But this rape was mostly a one-time phenomenon, and not living constantly in such a situation, as it happens in a husband-wife relationship. Those children grew up, found their love and partners, married, and led family life etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This study does not deny the short-term traumas of these children. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Whether it is a rape of adult women, or of children, it stays a crime. It does not become permissible while one study didn't find long-term effects due to rape. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it was a complete absence of Academic Integrity from Daniel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He does not think his audience deserves to know that his source is highly controversial. The Rind is one of the most controversial papers ever. (Link: &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also omits that Rind et al stated that CSA (Child Sexual Abuse) should remain criminalized, which is irreconcilable with Daniel claiming that CSA is supposedly acceptable and safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. study has been criticized by many scientists and researchers, on the grounds that its &lt;a title=&quot;Methodology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology&quot;&gt;methodology&lt;/a&gt; and conclusions are poorly designed and statistically flawed.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Glicken_4-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Glicken-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Rosenthal_5-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Rosenthal-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-McCoy_6-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-McCoy-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Its definition of &lt;i&gt;harm&lt;/i&gt;, for example, has been the subject of debate, as it only examined self-reported long-term psychological effects in young adults. In contrast, harm can have several forms, including short-term or medical harm (for example, &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sexually transmitted disease&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease&quot;&gt;sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt; or injuries), a likelihood of revictimization, and the amount of time the victim spent attending &lt;a title=&quot;Therapy&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy&quot;&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; for the abuse.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-McCoy_6-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-McCoy-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Numerous studies and professional clinical experience in the field of psychology, both before and after Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.'s publications, have long borne out that children cannot consent to sexual activity and that child and adolescent sexual abuse cause harm.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dallam2001_7-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Dallam2001-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dallam_8-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Dallam-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Salter_9-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Salter-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Psychologist &lt;a title=&quot;Anna Salter&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Salter&quot;&gt;Anna Salter&lt;/a&gt; comments that Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.'s results are “truly an outlier” compared to other meta-analyses.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Salter_9-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Salter-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel also defended that women should not be given Equal Rights, as it will destroy society.

&lt;/div&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Muslim Apologists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://muslimskeptic.com/author/drjou/&quot;&gt;Daniel Haquiqajou&lt;/a&gt; come up with excuses like (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Video link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marriage and sex with 9 years old pre-pubescent girl was a 'tradition' of that era. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vast majority of history, life expectancy was relatively low. Moreover, infant mortality was considerably high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, it was then necessary to use the extent of the 'fertility window' for reproduction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is why Islam didn't prohibit this practice, but the prophet Muhammad himself married a 9 years old 'Aisha. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam let even a breastfed girl be wed and used as a sex object. This has absolutely nothing to do with the excuse of “reproduction” that Islam apologists like Daniel Haquiqajou make. This Islamic ruling is purely for the benefit and pleasure of old men, while Islam didn't respect the rights of girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;'Aisha was wed to Muhammad at the age of 6 years when she was not even able to give her consent. Yes, Abu Bakr didn't have to ask her about her consent, but he directly married her to Muhammad. Later, at the age of 9 years, she was sent to Muhammad's home for the consummation of the marriage. But it is not necessary for Islamic Sharia to wait till the age of 9 years to send the minor girl to her husband's house, but she could be sent to him even if she is a breastfed baby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Actually, Muslim men were buying small slave child-girls from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, and then using them for sexual pleasures. It happened due to another evil of Islamic slavery, where Islam allowed the owners to separate the children from their slave parents, and sell them in the Bazaars of slavery when they got 2 teeth (i.e. at the age of 6 months). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, there are authentic reports that companions of Muhammad not only used to rape captive women, but also captive pre-pubescent minor girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism, and wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1799_%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%AC-%D9%A8/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_53&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself. As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Furthermore,&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; Human nature dictates that as boys and girls reach adulthood, they naturally experience feelings of love. However, Islam denies girls the right to freely fall in love with a boy of their choice. They can be married off to older men, depriving them of the opportunity to develop natural affection for someone their age. If they dare to follow their heart and develop feelings for a boy of their choice, they may face severe consequences such as beatings or even death, all in the name of terms like modesty, decency, adultery, or Ghairah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000dff;&quot;&gt;Extreme Dangers&lt;/span&gt; for teen mothers and their babies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;1. Science says 25-30 is the age of least risk to mother and child for a first pregnancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;With the onset of puberty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory essentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology around the age of 25–30 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2.. The younger the mother, the greater the risk. Childbearing in adolescents aged 12–15 years in low resource countries: a neglected issue. New estimates from demographic and household surveys in 42 countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;It is frequently cited that girls who give birth aged 15–19 are more than twice as likely to die as those in their 20s (1, 2). However, this fails to capture the fact that risk increases with decreasing age. ......girls aged 15 or under had an odds ratio for maternal death four times higher than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;3. It is not just mortality, it's fistulas. Science says it is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;4. Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The women and girls who do survive often develop fistulas, which are holes between the vaginal wall and the rectum or bladder. When the baby's head pushes down and gets stuck, it can cut portions of the mother's soft tissue between its skull and her pelvic bones. As a result, the tissue dies, and a hole forms. Faeces and urine then leak through the hole and out of the vagina. Women with fistulas are often divorced and shunned. And young girls are at higher risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0006ff;&quot;&gt;Even if they survive&lt;/span&gt;, still the Children of teen mothers suffer &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;dreadful health problems their entire life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;High mortality rate among babies from teen mothers is not the only problem, they also suffer from other horrific health problems too their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Intense opposition to the marriage of young girls is brought in the name of R. Shimon bar Yohai, that “Whoever marries off his daughter when she is young minimizes the bearing of children and loses his money and comes to bloodshed.”5 5. Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, Version II, ch. 48, p. 66. The concern is that the young girl may become pregnant and die as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;500 years before Muhammed, doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soranus_of_Ephesus&quot;&gt;Soranus&lt;/a&gt; wrote his book about gynaecology and in hit he stated that women could be considered fit for conception from 15. 15 is significantly older than 9. Soranus was from Ephesos and worked in Alexandria before he moved to Rome. So he had met desert-conditions girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soranus wrote in his book of gynaecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/book/2189958/9b5cce/soranus-gynecology.html&quot;&gt;Soranus, Of Ephesus and Owsei Temkin (1994) &lt;em&gt;Soranus’ gynecology&lt;/em&gt;. Baltimore Johns Hopkins Univ. Press.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 233):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book about gynecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &quot;For it obtains whenever women married before maturity conceive and give birth while the uterus has not yet fully grown nor the fundus of (the) uterus expanded.&quot; So they knew the pelvic floor and birth canal were not mature enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 227)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... difficult labor occur in those who give birth in a way which is contrary to nature? Diocles the Caerystan in the second book on gynecology says that primiparae and young women have difficult labor&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Recognize Those Capable of Conception:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since women usually are married for the sake of children and succession and not for mere enjoyment and since it is utterly absurd to make inquiries about the excellence of their lineage and the abundance of their means but to leave unexamined whether they can conceive or not and whether they are fit for childbearing or not it is only right for us to give an account of the matter in question One must judge the majority from the ages of 15 to 40 to be fit for conception&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here was the law in the Roman Empire before Muhammad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/146/abstract/roman-law-and-marriage-underage-girls&quot;&gt;Roman Law and the Marriage of Underage Girls&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;Twelve will seem to us undesirably young, and indeed ancient doctors such as Soranus warned against the dangers of women becoming sexually active at so early an age. Most Roman women appear to have married later, from about 15 to 20. But the possibility of efarlier marriage we know to have been actively pursued especially in upper-class families, where marriage often assisted dynastic alliances.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Sparta:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In fact, Sparta raised the marriage age from 18 to 20 with the primary aim of decreasing the number of sickly children. As a result, they observed an increase in life expectancy for women, which began to rival that of men. It became evident that child marriage was the main contributing factor to mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While Athenian women might have expected to marry for the first time around the &lt;strong&gt;age of fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; to men much older than them, Spartan women normally married between the ages of eighteen and twenty to men close to them in age.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-FOOTNOTECartledge198194–95_29-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTECartledge198194%E2%80%9395-29&quot;&gt;[29]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Spartan ideology, the primary role of adult women was to bear and raise healthy children. This focus on childbearing was likely responsible for the emphasis on physical fitness in Spartan women, as it was believed that physically stronger women would have healthier children.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlundell1995157-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bearing and raising children was considered the most important role for women in Spartan society; equal to male warriors in the Spartan army.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-50&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-50&quot;&gt;[50]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Spartan women were encouraged to produce many children, preferably male, to increase Sparta's military population. They took pride in having borne and raised brave warriors.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-51&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-51&quot;&gt;[51]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hence, even with an emphasis on bearing numerous children, Sparta raised the age of marriage for women to 18–20 years. Interestingly, this decision did not hinder Spartan women from having many children. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in the mortality rate among both mothers and children. Additionally, this measure curbed the birth of weak offspring prone to diseases. As a result, only healthy and robust children were born, growing up to become outstanding warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&quot;text-24 xs:text-20&quot;&gt;Laws at the time of Muhammed.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two dominant neighbouring empires had already prohibited intercourse with 9 years old girls before Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ijtihadnet.com/wp-content/uploads/Minor-Marriage-in-Early-Islamic-Law.pdf&quot;&gt; Laws at the time of Muhammed Minor Marriage in Early Islamic Law, Carolyn G. Baugh, LEIDEN | BOSTON, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although investigation into Sasanian-era (224â€“651 CE) child marriage prac-tices unearths scant information, the age of twelve is again important for girls. According to the Avesta, the age of majority was clearly set at fifteen for boys as well as girls; Middle Persian civil law allowed marriage at age nine, provided that consummation wait until age twelve.[24]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byzantine law required that a girl attain the age of thirteen before contract-ing a marriage. Whether she would have consented to the marriage or not prior to this age is deemed immaterial as she would have no legally viable consent to give.[22] All parties to a marriage needed to issue consent, including the groom, the bride, and her parents. In cases where a girl consented to intercourse prior to marriage it was assumed that she consented to the marriage itself and the families would then arrange it. However, if that intercourse occurred prior to the age of thirteen, the groom would meet with the law’s most serious punish-ments due to the girl’s assumed legal inability to consent.[23]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Muhammed it was known to be injurious to girls to engage in very early intercourse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Consequences of Child Marriage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modem Medicine shows that childbirth for females below the age of seventeen and â€¢ above forty leads to &lt;strong&gt;greater maternal mortality as well as infant mortality&lt;/strong&gt; (London  1992, 501). It must he made clear that although conditions commonly associated with poverty, e.g. malnutrition, poor physical health and other negative circumstances may contribute to difficult births and bad health for young mothers, consistent findings indicate that the age factor plays a significant role by itself. &quot;Even under the best of modern conditions, women who give birth before the age of seventeen have a higher mortality rate than older women. The closer a woman is to menarche, &lt;strong&gt;the greater the risk to both mother and child, as well as to the mother's future child bearing capabilities, for the reproductive system has not completely matured when ovulation begins&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. (Demand 1994, 102).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem seen more often among underprivileged women is that they develop **fistulae which is often due to the pelvis not having fully formed. This can be caused by a complicated pregnancy or having intercourse at a very young age.**28. This leads the girl or woman to have permanent damage and often she is shunned by her family and community (4). Although such a condition is preventable it requires a good health service and communications systems (S). Unfortunately, these are often not available in impoverished areas of the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge of medical complications involved with early marriage cannot be considered &quot;new&quot; findings. Ancient and Medieval Medicine texts indicate that doctors were well aware of the physical harm posed to girls by early marriages and pregnancies&lt;/strong&gt;. â€¦â€¦..In fact, not only doctors of Medicine but other scholars in Most societies had a clear understanding that intercourse should not take place before the menarche. &lt;strong&gt;Hesiod suggested marriage in the fifth year after puberty, or age nineteen, and Plato in the Laws mandated from sixteen to twenty years of age, and in the Republic he gave the age as twenty. Aristotle specifically warned against early childbearing for women as a cause of small and weak infants and difficult and dangerous labor for the mother, and the Spartans avoided it for just those reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; (Demand 1994, 102)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)” is supposedly accepted and safe&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Then Muslim preacher Daniel mentions “evolutionary adaptive”, and claims that academics agree with him that “Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)” is supposedly accepted and safe. And as proof, he put the “Bruce Rind Study”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But it was again a deception by Daniel on many accounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Rind Study was not about the reproduction of children, which is the main argument by Muslims for early marriages of prepubescent girls in order to defend Islam. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Rind Study was only limited to 'long term effects' upon children, who were raped. It concluded that there were no significant long-term effects found in children, who were abused. But this rape was mostly a one-time phenomenon, and not living constantly in such a situation, as it happens in a husband-wife relationship. Those children grew up, found their love and partners, married, and led family life etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This study does not deny the short-term traumas of these children. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Whether it is a rape of adult women, or of children, it stays a crime. It does not become permissible while one study didn't find long-term effects due to rape. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it was a complete absence of Academic Integrity from Daniel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He does not think his audience deserves to know that his source is highly controversial. The Rind is one of the most controversial papers ever. (Link: &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also omits that Rind et al stated that CSA (Child Sexual Abuse) should remain criminalized, which is irreconcilable with Daniel claiming that CSA is supposedly acceptable and safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. study has been criticized by many scientists and researchers, on the grounds that its &lt;a title=&quot;Methodology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology&quot;&gt;methodology&lt;/a&gt; and conclusions are poorly designed and statistically flawed.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Glicken_4-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Glicken-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Rosenthal_5-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Rosenthal-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-McCoy_6-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-McCoy-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Its definition of &lt;i&gt;harm&lt;/i&gt;, for example, has been the subject of debate, as it only examined self-reported long-term psychological effects in young adults. In contrast, harm can have several forms, including short-term or medical harm (for example, &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sexually transmitted disease&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease&quot;&gt;sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt; or injuries), a likelihood of revictimization, and the amount of time the victim spent attending &lt;a title=&quot;Therapy&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy&quot;&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; for the abuse.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-McCoy_6-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-McCoy-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Numerous studies and professional clinical experience in the field of psychology, both before and after Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.'s publications, have long borne out that children cannot consent to sexual activity and that child and adolescent sexual abuse cause harm.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dallam2001_7-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Dallam2001-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dallam_8-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Dallam-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Salter_9-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Salter-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Psychologist &lt;a title=&quot;Anna Salter&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Salter&quot;&gt;Anna Salter&lt;/a&gt; comments that Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.'s results are “truly an outlier” compared to other meta-analyses.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Salter_9-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Salter-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel also defended that women should not be given Equal Rights, as it will destroy society. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-general/171-patriarchy-argument-from-muslim-preachers-why-women-should-not-be-given-equal-rights-and-must-be-kept-under-men&quot;&gt;Patriarchy: Argument from Muslim Preachers why women should not be given EQUAL Rights and must be kept under men.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId841057&quot;&gt;(1) Daniel claimed that the evolution of human societies is linked to this practice, where they imposed Hijab on women&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId635954&quot;&gt;(2) Daniel's argument: Spread of AIDS due to TEMPORARY Sexual Relationships in the non-Muslims countries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId628608&quot;&gt;(3) Daniel's argument of Mate-Guarding &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId269792&quot;&gt;(4) Daniel's claim: Only men have responsibilities when it comes to Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId399691&quot;&gt;(5) Depression is all-time high in Islamic countries like Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId188243&quot;&gt;(6) Daniel claims that rate of Divorce is higher in Western countries while women have got equal human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId822339&quot;&gt;(7) Hijab brings only Sexual Frustration in an Islamic society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId918743&quot;&gt;(8) If Muslim States don't let women go outside without Hijab, then the Western countries also don't let you go naked outside in public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId985135&quot;&gt;(9) Islamic preachers: But moving naked in public brings a lot of evils&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId323910&quot;&gt;(10) Naturism in western countries is totally different from the Islamic forced nakedness of slave women and their rape:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId354264&quot;&gt;(11) The case of Hijab in the Islamic countries is totally Opposite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId554334&quot;&gt;(12) Muslim Youth in Islamic Societies has no chance to get rid of their Sexual Frustration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId841057&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(1) Daniel claims that the evolution of human societies is linked to the practice where they imposed hijab on women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;No. The evolution of human societies is not linked to this practice of hijab. There are thousands of tribes, which even exist today, where women and men are totally naked or women are topless. There are tons of videos on YouTube about them. For example, look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newatlantisline&quot;&gt;Youtube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel is making a mistake, whereas there were only a handful of societies that imposed hijab on women historically, and they did it only to differentiate between free women of noble families and slave women/prostitutes. They prohibited slave women and prostitutes from wearing hijab and from resembling free women from noble families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elite women in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Byzantine, Greek, and Persian empires wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_80-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-80&quot;&gt;[79]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria had explicit &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sumptuary laws&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_laws&quot;&gt;sumptuary laws&lt;/a&gt; detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_80-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-80&quot;&gt;[79]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-El_Guindi_2-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-El_Guindi-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad only followed those few societies in this discrimination; he banned slave women from wearing hijab. Umar ibn Al-Khattab used to beat slave women with a stick if they wore hijab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by wearing hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's companions used to molest women who went out to relieve themselves in the evening for nature's call. Upon that, Muhammad ordered free Muslim women, in the name of revelation, to wear hijab so that they could be recognized as free women and not molested as slave women were molested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad also kept the breasts of slave women naked in public. Yes, there were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. They were sold in that same naked state in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, as Islam prohibited Slave Women from taking a Hijab or even covering their naked breasts in public 🔥ʰᵒᵗ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId635954&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(2) Daniel claims that AIDS is spreading due to TEMPORARY Sexual Relationships in non-Muslim countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But Islam also allowed &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEMPORARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sexual Relationships with dozens of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Islam, a man is allowed to buy a slave woman (or capture a prisoner woman) and rape her legally. And when he fulfils his lust, then she can be handed over to his brother, or male slave. And when all brothers and slaves have raped her one by one in a &lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship, then she can be sold to 2nd master, who again rapes her and sells her to the 3rd master .... and thus the rape of poor slave woman continued in such a &lt;strong&gt;TEMPORARY&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details in our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the original Islamic Sharia could not have saved Muslims from HIV due to temporary sexual relationships with dozens of slave women. Muslims have been saved from HIV only when the Western world compelled them to abolish Slavery, which is permitted (Halal) in Sharia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, instead of criminalizing natural behaviors between consenting adults and forbidding people from engaging in them, the solution to preventing illness transmission through sexual activity lies in finding treatments for such diseases and implementing measures to stop their propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIDS research has advanced considerably, leading to fewer HIV-related fatalities than those caused by conditions such as diabetes&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Health/uk-doctor-id-hiv-diabetes/story?id=23349162&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR2pDq3PiGgquKqzomP-5RoAgokJh_cl0fgQ5UPSR7-0HSeoRt7g4sTQxO8&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId628608&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(3) Daniel's argument of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_guarding_in_humans&quot;&gt;Mate-Guarding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel's claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_guarding_in_humans&quot;&gt;Mate-Guarding&lt;/a&gt; is a part of human evolution and even of apes is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Bonobo apes, unlike other apes, do not practice mate-guarding. This behavior is influenced by their environment, where food is abundant and competition for mates is not as intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even among chimpanzees, females engage in relations with multiple males despite the concept of mate-guarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In human societies, there have been and still are several cultures where a woman can have multiple husbands, as seen in this link (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry#:%7E:text=Polyandry%20has%20been%20practised%20in,only%20among%20higher%20caste%20women.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, look at the Inuit culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/inuit-social-organization%3E&quot;&gt;The Canadian Encyclopedia: &quot;Inuit: Social Organization&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - This article states, &quot;When a man left his home for an extended period, a neighbor or friend took care of his family, including his wife. Children born from such arrangements were considered equal members of the household.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uaf.edu/anthropology/faculty/dietz/inuit_culture_and_society/%3E&quot;&gt;The University of Alaska Fairbanks' &quot;Inuit Culture and Society&quot; page&lt;/a&gt; - This resource notes, &quot;Inuit families were often fluid and flexible, with children being raised by multiple caregivers. When a man had to leave his home for an extended period, a neighbor or friend would take care of his family, including his wife. Children born from these arrangements were considered full members of the household.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples show that mate-guarding is not a universal behavior among animals or humans, and various cultural practices and environmental factors influence mating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, in Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Swapping of slave women is also allowed (i.e. two masters can swap their slave girls, and rape them without their consent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;A Muslim master can take the slave-wife of his male slave from him, and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, he can return her to his male slave. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;And if a slave woman is shared between multiple masters, and they do sex with her one by one, then the child will have officially multiple fathers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And it is the right of the owner either to accept the child from his slave women as his own or to deny the child his name. In this case, that child will be called a Bastard (Islamic Terminology is &quot;Walad al-Haram ولد الحرام&quot;), and the child becomes the slave of his own father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read this detailed article for swapping, shared slave women and parentage of a child from a slave woman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery Against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam has no problem with men having sex with 4 wives and dozens of slave girls (which he can rotate by selling older slave girls and buying new slave girls). Thus, Islam denies any mate-guarding in the case of men. It allows men to enjoy their lives. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Islam didn't allow Muslim men to buy and rape new slave girls out of any &lt;strong&gt;NECESSITY&lt;/strong&gt;, but it allowed them in order to fulfil their &lt;strong&gt;LUST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;What about the poor male slave who could not mate guard his wife, and the owner took his wife away from him and raped her? What kind of Islamic Mate Guauding is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And in mate guarding, the males didn't hand over their females to other males after &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; sexual relationships. But Islam allows the owner to have a &quot;temporary&quot; sexual relationship with his slave girl, and after fulfilling his lust, he can hand her over to his brother or slave, or sell her to another master. Therefore, this trait of Islam is not even counted as mate guarding, but Islam is only guarding men and their lust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Islam only comes into play when it needs to place restrictions on women in the name of mate guarding. The sole excuse is that women should not be allowed to enjoy their lives while there is an issue of determining the paternity of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the issue of paternity can be easily resolved with modern medical tests and DNA. Yet, Muslims still refuse to allow women to enjoy their lives and instead force them to wait for their husbands (even if they are preoccupied with other wives or slave girls, or if they are weak in sex and cannot satisfy them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older women or those who are already pregnant have no chance of becoming pregnant again. Nevertheless, Islam denies them any opportunity to enjoy their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be acceptable if both partners agreed to be exclusive in their marriage or partnership. However, Islam has become one-sided, permitting men to have multiple sexual partners while imposing restrictions solely on women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel's claim is based on the notion that only men bear financial responsibilities for children. Therefore, women should not have the authority to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the right to decide on abortion is not about a child, but about a fetus. The fetus has not yet been born, so there is no question of financial responsibility. Furthermore, only women have to endure the entire nine-month pregnancy, including the associated risks and discomforts. Consequently, the right to decide about abortion belongs exclusively to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Daniel's perspective overlooks the practices in Western countries. In these societies, when a woman earns income, she also shares the financial responsibility for the child, just like the father does. If the woman earns more than the father, her financial contribution may exceed his. Moreover, custody decisions are based on the best interests of the child, regardless of the gender of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, women have the same responsibilities concerning their children as fathers do. If a father takes care of the children, the mother is expected to provide financial support to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of pregnancy and delivery, only women have to endure the painful process, while husbands do not have a role in this biological aspect. Therefore, it is logical that women should have the right to make decisions regarding delivery or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, even if we were to accept that Islam places the burden of financial responsibility squarely on the shoulders of fathers, this would only serve to highlight the inherent flaws in the system. Under Islamic law, a father remains financially liable for his children and wife, even if he becomes impoverished or severely disabled and unable to work. On the other hand, a wealthy wife is not obligated to contribute financially to her husband's needs or those of her children. This glaring disparity raises questions about the fairness and balance of the Islamic system. Why, then, do Islamic apologists boast about such an unjust arrangement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Islamic system is further criticized for declaring the wife and children as the property of the man under the guise of the husband's financial responsibility. He can beat his wife, even with bruises&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=20&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;), but the poor wife cannot take divorce on the basis of this brutal beating&lt;/span&gt;. And he can also beat children, and if he kills them, still he will not be physically punished for that, as children are considered his property in Islam. Unbelievable. Please read our article: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=154&amp;amp;catid=35&quot;&gt;A child is the father's property in Islamic Sharia, thus the father cannot be physically punished for killing his child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, due to this unjust financial responsibility imposed solely on fathers, Islam seeks to deprive women of their right in making choices regarding delivery or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId399691&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(5) Depression is all-time high in Islamic countries like Pakistan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel's conclusion about Western people suffering more from depression than in Islamic countries is unsubstantiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of depression in Islamic countries, like Pakistan, is significant higher, as indicated in this research: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728784/#:~:text=Depression%20is%20a%20debilitating%20mood,at%2047%25%20%5B8%5D&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728784/#:~:text=Depression%20is%20a%20debilitating%20mood,at%2047%25%20%5B8%5D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the depression of women in Islamic countries is often underreported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, people experienced depression even with simple restrictions like wearing a mask. In contrast, Muslim women are required to wear the whole Hijab (and even Niqab). It is natural that the Hijab and Niqab are a source of extreme depression for a lot of Muslim women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Muslim women are discouraged from leaving their homes, and face discomfort when venturing outside. Their freedom of movement is limited, causing them to experience distressing situations when they are outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, also think about the depression that slave women had to suffer due to Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their masters could rape them against their consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their masters could hand them over to any of their brothers or male slaves to rape them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The master could break their family life, take the slave wife from his male slaves, and rape her. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The masters could separate the slave mothers from their children, and sell them (or their babies) in the Bazaars of Islamic slavery after the child had got 2 teeth (at 6 months approximately). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad allowed his followers to rape the captive minor and virgin girls the first night, although they had killed their fathers and brothers during the daytime. Just imagine the trauma those poor girls had to endure in that situation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There is an extensive list of documented crimes committed by Islam against humanity concerning the treatment of slave girls. For more in-depth information, please refer to our detailed article titled: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In addition to this, Daniel's claim regarding the higher suicide rate in Western countries as evidence of Western women being in depression is incorrect. Studies have shown that Western people tend to report higher levels of happiness compared to individuals in Islamic countries. However, in cases where individuals are suffering from severe illnesses and have lost interest in life, they may seek the right to Euthanasia (which some Muslims mistakenly label as suicide). Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=118&amp;amp;catid=17&quot;&gt;Suicide: Why the rate of suicide is higher in the Atheist Community?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId188243&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(6) Daniel claims that EQUAL human rights for women are the reason for the higher Divorce rate in Western countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel argues that equal human rights for women are behind the high divorce rates in Western nations. However, a closer examination of affluent Islamic countries like Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia tells a different story. Despite women lacking equal rights in these societies, the divorce rate exceeds 50%, surpassing that of numerous non-Muslim Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It appears that wealth alone can drive up the divorce rate, regardless of gender equality. When women become financially independent, they refuse to tolerate exploitation. Meanwhile, the Islamic system perpetuates the subjugation of women, treating them as mere slaves. Perhaps Muslims should follow through on this logic and enslave their women entirely; that way, they could achieve a zero divorce rate while Islam gives absolutely no human rights to slave women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at Pakistan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Pakistan is at the top in the search for INCEST Porn in the world (for the last 2 decades).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;80% of child girls are raped by their fathers, brothers, cousins, uncles, and grandfathers. Their cases are not even registered in the police stations. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=10&amp;amp;catid=9&quot;&gt;Incest in Islamic Pakistan.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Pakistan is at the top in search of terms like &quot;donkey rape&quot; on Google. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thousands of children are being raped in Quran Schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Women are molested by mobs. This thing never happens in Western countries. It may be individual men indulge in abuses against women, but never a mob of men molest a woman. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim women are even molested during Hajj (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220114154056/https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/s3v9fb/sexual_assault_during_hajj/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While western women at disco parties and beaches are safer from molestation than Muslim women during Hajj gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read our articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId918743&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(8) Apologist Argument: If Muslim states enforce the Hijab for women, then Western countries also impose restrictions on public nudity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with Muslim preachers is their denial of the &quot;Evolution of Dress,&quot; which is a factual phenomenon. The evolution of dress began as a response to weather conditions, as our ancestors migrated to colder or hotter regions. They needed clothing for protection against extreme temperatures, while modern humans lost their body hair, leaving them vulnerable to the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the way people dressed became a symbol of status, with women from wealthy families covering themselves more, while women from poorer families or slaves often remained naked or partially clothed. This evolution eventually turned into a fashion trend. The lower class people, including slaves, often wore little to no clothing, and the upper class wore very luxurious clothing. Clothing norms evolved from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothing has an interesting history, but it wasn’t originally invented for “modesty” reasons. Actually, ancient people had no issue with clothing at all, and dress codes became established relatively recently on a human history timescale. It was these dress codes that led to the cultural aversion in some places of people being naked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question arises: Why do Muslim preachers solely use Western countries as their example? They should also consider indigenous tribes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newatlantisline&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) that have practised &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;Naturism&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. a lifestyle of practising non-sexual social &lt;a title=&quot;Nudity&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity&quot;&gt;nudity&lt;/a&gt; in private and in public) for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these tribes move naked in public without any dress, they still maintain a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;strong family system&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;These tribes don’t have rape and sexual assault as a big issue within them, and men and women see each other COMPLETELY NAKED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Compared to this, millions of Muslim women experience extreme molestation in Muslim countries despite wearing the Hijab. Even during the most religious Hajj gatherings, Muslim girls are exposed to extreme molestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1d00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read all details in this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western countries, too, have experienced a gradual evolution of dress. Influenced by the Christian religion for centuries, many Westerners still adhere to conservative dress codes. However, there is a growing movement of naturists in these countries, leading to the establishment of hundreds of nude beaches where nudity is completely normalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Denmark, nudism is permitted along 4,500 kilometres of coastline (where kids are also present along with families), and the same applies to other Scandinavian countries (source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/naturists-in-scandinavia/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/naturists-in-scandinavia/&lt;/a&gt;). While private offices and government institutions may have specific dress codes, in your personal life, you are even free to wear a bikini in public places. Despite the presence of bikinis in public or even total nudity on beaches, women in Western countries are not subjected to molestation and generally enjoy a safer environment compared to Muslim women, who unfortunately face instances of molestation even during Hajj gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, there is technically no law about nudity in Denmark. There is a relevant law, though, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;It is forbidden to display obscene or offensive behavior, that is likely to offend others or to outrage bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;Here’s the Danish text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;Det er forbudt at udvise uanstændig eller anstødelig opførsel, der er egnet til at forulempe andre eller vække offentlig forargelse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;The relevant word is “likely”. This makes the application of the law highly situational. Except for religious people in Denmark, other people will probably soon stop getting offended even if others move totally nude in public. It is just like indigenous tribes move naked and it is totally NORMAL for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Here is an introduction to the history of Nudity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;history of nudity&lt;/b&gt; involves social attitudes to nakedness of the human body in different cultures in history. The use of clothing to cover the body is one of the changes that mark the end of the Neolithic, and the beginning of civilizations. Nudity (or near-complete nudity) has traditionally been the social norm for both men and women in hunter-gatherer cultures in warm climates, and it is still common among many indigenous peoples. The need to cover the body is associated with human migration out of the tropics into climates where clothes were needed as protection from sun, heat, and dust in the Middle East; or from cold and rain in Europe and Asia. The first use of animal skins and cloth may have been as adornment, along with body modification, body painting, and jewelry, invented first for other purposes, such as magic, decoration, cult, or prestige. The skills used in their making were later found to be practical as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern societies, complete nudity in public became increasingly rare as nakedness became associated with lower status, but the mild Mediterranean climate allowed for a minimum of clothing, and in a number of ancient cultures, the athletic and/or cultist nudity of men and boys was a natural concept. In &lt;a title=&quot;Ancient Greece&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece&quot;&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;, nudity became associated with the perfection of the gods. In &lt;a title=&quot;Ancient Rome&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome&quot;&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;, complete nudity could be a public disgrace, though it could be seen at the public baths or in erotic art. In the Western world, with the spread of Christianity, any positive associations with nudity were replaced with concepts of sin and shame. Although rediscovery of Greek ideals in the Renaissance restored &lt;a title=&quot;Nude (art)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_%28art%29&quot;&gt;the nude&lt;/a&gt; to symbolic meaning in art, by the &lt;a title=&quot;Victorian era&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era&quot;&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt;, public nakedness was considered obscene. In Asia, public nudity has been viewed as a violation of social propriety rather than sin; embarrassing rather than shameful. However, in &lt;a title=&quot;Tokugawa shogunate&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, mixed-gender communal bathing was quite normal and commonplace until the &lt;a title=&quot;Meiji Restoration&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration&quot;&gt;Meiji Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the upper classes had turned clothing into &lt;a title=&quot;Fashion&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion&quot;&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;, those who could not afford otherwise continued to swim or bathe openly in natural bodies of water or frequent communal baths through the 19th century. Acceptance of public nudity re-emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosophically based movements, particularly in Germany, opposed the rise of industrialization. &lt;a title=&quot;Freikörperkultur&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freik%C3%B6rperkultur&quot;&gt;Freikörperkultur&lt;/a&gt; (Free Body Culture) represented a return to nature and the elimination of shame. In the 1960s &lt;a title=&quot;Naturism&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;naturism&lt;/a&gt; moved from being a small subculture to part of a general rejection of restrictions on the body. Women reasserted the right to uncover their breasts in public, which had been the norm until the 17th century. The trend continued in much of Europe, with the establishment of many clothing-optional areas in parks and on beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all of the historical changes in the &lt;a title=&quot;Developed country&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country&quot;&gt;developed countries&lt;/a&gt;, cultures in the tropical climates of &lt;a title=&quot;Sub-Saharan Africa&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa&quot;&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon rainforest&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest&quot;&gt;Amazon rainforest&lt;/a&gt; have continued with their traditional practices, being partially or completely nude during everyday activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId985135&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(9) Islam itself Practiced NUDITY (and the worst form of it while it was a FORCED Nudity)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic Preachers totally forget these realities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It was Islam who made slave women move in public topless. There were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad and in public with naked breasts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat them with a stick for taking Hijab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by taking the Hijab. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is 1300 year long history of Islam where slave women had to stay topless. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And Islam turned poor slave women into sexual objects too, and Muslim men were given licences to fulfil their sexual lusts by raping them. They were presented in that naked state in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery, where Muslim customers were also allowed to touch their private parts (just like sheep and cattle are groped before purchase). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And Muslim men were molesting slave women, without any fear of physical punishment, while Allah (i.e. Muhammad) didn't punish or even rebuked them for molesting slave women. Muslim men were raping slave girls in Temporary Sexual Relationships, and selling them, in order to buy new slave girls to rape them too. They were even buying small non-adult girls from slave markets to use them as sexual objects. They were swapping their slave girls and raping them. In short, Islamic Sharia turned Muslim men into serial rapists legally by giving them full control over the poor slave girls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId323910&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(10) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;Naturism&lt;/a&gt; in Western countries is totally different from the Islamic forced nakedness of slave women and their rape:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturism is not about sex, but it is based upon respect for humans and their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can force a woman to become topless or nude. And forget about rape, no one is allowed to even touch a woman without her consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturism is associated with absolutely no evil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers who blame Naturism for the rise in divorce rates in Western countries are mistaken. Indigenous tribes have practiced Naturism for centuries and still maintain strong family systems and successful marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual reasons behind the increasing divorce rates in Western countries differ. Advancements in technology and societal structures have made life more manageable for people, reducing their reliance on family support. This convenience has contributed to the higher divorce rates. If challenging times were to resurface and people once again required family support for survival, the family system would naturally strengthen once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is evident in Gulf Muslim countries where the divorce rate has reached 50%, even surpassing some Western countries. Despite practicing no Naturism and adhering to full Hijab, the high divorce rate is attributed to the fact that people in these affluent Gulf countries do not necessarily rely on strong family systems to sustain themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribal system, much like the family system, was robust in the past when people depended on their tribes for survival. However, in modern times, especially in cities, the tribal system has diminished as a society no longer requires tribal support to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId354264&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(11) The case of Hijab in the Islamic countries is totally Opposite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Naturist Movement in Western countries is not compelling Muslim women to become topless, but it is liberating all humans. It is about human rights and respecting one's choice for his/her dressing. Modesty and decency are not hidden in the Hijab, but modesty and decency are to &lt;strong&gt;RESPECT&lt;/strong&gt; the women and their choices. The Western world is the most decent, as it educates men to &lt;b&gt;RESPECT&lt;/b&gt; women and their choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the issue of the Hijab in Islamic countries is totally opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic Hijab is plagued by several evils:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first evil is the blatant discrimination and humiliation it inflicts on millions of slave women. Islamic Sharia historically prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab, reserving it only for free Muslim women as a symbol of respect and honor. Muslim women today should not view the Hijab as a personal choice but should stand with us in protesting against this extreme injustice faced by millions of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second evil of the Islamic Hijab is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hijab is practically IMPOSED by force upon the private lives of millions of women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a TOOL in the hands of men, in order to take away their liberties and make them dependent upon men so that men can exploit them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hijab is used in order to usurp the basic human rights of women. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Hijab's demands of women extend to limiting their movement within the confines of their homes, forbidding unnecessary interactions with men. This gender segregation breeds further problems, leading men to fetishize even the smallest glimpses of women's bodies due to the lack of normal exposure. The restrictions imposed by the Hijab and Islamic modesty contribute to sexual frustration among Muslim men and hinder natural interactions between men and women, preventing understanding and respectful treatment. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Please read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Islamic Hijab &amp;amp; Modesty حياء leads only towards Sexual Frustration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, a natural emotion, is stifled by the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء). Islam disapproves of love stories like Layla and Majnun (comparable to Romeo and Juliet) and severely punishes individuals involved in love. Islam employs the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء) to suppress and control this natural emotion, reflecting an approach contrary to embracing nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Islamic practice, girls are practically coerced into marrying men they have never interacted with or know little about their mentality and personality. This not only makes the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء) oppressive but also qualifies as crimes against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imposition of the Hijab transforms women's lives into a constant struggle, subjecting them to numerous hardships daily. To witness the actual ramifications of these evils, please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=4&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Negative role of 'Hijab' and 'Islamic Modesty' in the incident of Ifk&lt;/a&gt; (Highly recommended)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In earlier centuries, Muslim men had opportunities to interact with the opposite sex, while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There were thousands of slave women present in public (and even their breasts were naked).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslim men also raping the slave women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And even Muhammad was moving in public while holding the hands of slave girls of other men (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6072&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6072&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4177&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 4177&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern times, the existence of slave women, thanks to the influence of the Western world, is no longer prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Muslim boys face challenges in getting married until they reach around 30 years of age. They often prioritize obtaining an education, securing a stable job, and saving a significant amount of money for dowry, also known as Haq Mehr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unnatural restrictions imposed by Islam on the interaction between the opposite sexes inevitably result in extreme sexual frustration among Muslim youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incident from the time of Muhammad, the Sahaba (companions), highlights the struggle of controlling their desires. Initially, Muhammad/Allah forbade them from having sexual relations with their wives during the nights of Ramadan. However, unable to cope, the Sahaba secretly visited their wives during Ramadan nights. Eventually, Muhammad/Allah had to revoke this order and permit the Sahaba to engage in sexual activity during Ramadan nights. This incident is documented in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surah Al-Baqarah (2:187)&lt;br /&gt;“It is (now) made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting) ... Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves (by going to wives secretly), so He turned to you and forgave you (for this sin). So now you are allowed to have sexual relations with your wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/urn/178360&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4508&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Al-Bara': When the order of compulsory fasting of Ramadan was revealed, the people did not have sexual relations with their wives for the whole month of Ramadan, but some men cheated themselves (by violating that restriction). So Allah revealed: &quot;Allah is aware that you were deceiving yourselves but He accepted your repentance and forgave you..&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inability of Sahaba to control their sexual desires for 30 nights during Ramadan raises questions about how Muslim youth today can possibly suppress their desires for an extended period of 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim preachers suggest fasting as a means to control sexual desires, but it's evident that even Sahaba, who were also fasting during Ramadan, struggled with their desires for those 30 nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Muslim argument is to marry boys and girls at the age of 12. However, this is not practical, as even Muhammad himself did not marry until the age of 25. Many fathers do not wish for their daughters to marry someone who is not financially stable. No father wants his daughter to face hunger. No father wants her daughter to become a baby-producing machine at the age of 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These realities lead to extreme sexual frustration in Islamic societies, with no apparent solution to escape this issue. The problem persists and poses significant challenges to Muslim youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId841057&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(1) Daniel claims that the evolution of human societies is linked to the practice where they imposed hijab on women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;No. The evolution of human societies is not linked to this practice of hijab. There are thousands of tribes, which even exist today, where women and men are totally naked or women are topless. There are tons of videos on YouTube about them. For example, look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newatlantisline&quot;&gt;Youtube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel is making a mistake, whereas there were only a handful of societies that imposed hijab on women historically, and they did it only to differentiate between free women of noble families and slave women/prostitutes. They prohibited slave women and prostitutes from wearing hijab and from resembling free women from noble families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elite women in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Byzantine, Greek, and Persian empires wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_80-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-80&quot;&gt;[79]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria had explicit &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sumptuary laws&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_laws&quot;&gt;sumptuary laws&lt;/a&gt; detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_80-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-80&quot;&gt;[79]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-El_Guindi_2-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-El_Guindi-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad only followed those few societies in this discrimination; he banned slave women from wearing hijab. Umar ibn Al-Khattab used to beat slave women with a stick if they wore hijab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by wearing hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's companions used to molest women who went out to relieve themselves in the evening for nature's call. Upon that, Muhammad ordered free Muslim women, in the name of revelation, to wear hijab so that they could be recognized as free women and not molested as slave women were molested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad also kept the breasts of slave women naked in public. Yes, there were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. They were sold in that same naked state in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, as Islam prohibited Slave Women from taking a Hijab or even covering their naked breasts in public 🔥ʰᵒᵗ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But Islam also allowed &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEMPORARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sexual Relationships with dozens of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Islam, a man is allowed to buy a slave woman (or capture a prisoner woman) and rape her legally. And when he fulfils his lust, then she can be handed over to his brother, or male slave. And when all brothers and slaves have raped her one by one in a &lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship, then she can be sold to 2nd master, who again rapes her and sells her to the 3rd master .... and thus the rape of poor slave woman continued in such a &lt;strong&gt;TEMPORARY&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details in our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the original Islamic Sharia could not have saved Muslims from HIV due to temporary sexual relationships with dozens of slave women. Muslims have been saved from HIV only when the Western world compelled them to abolish Slavery, which is permitted (Halal) in Sharia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, instead of criminalizing natural behaviors between consenting adults and forbidding people from engaging in them, the solution to preventing illness transmission through sexual activity lies in finding treatments for such diseases and implementing measures to stop their propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIDS research has advanced considerably, leading to fewer HIV-related fatalities than those caused by conditions such as diabetes&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Health/uk-doctor-id-hiv-diabetes/story?id=23349162&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR2pDq3PiGgquKqzomP-5RoAgokJh_cl0fgQ5UPSR7-0HSeoRt7g4sTQxO8&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId628608&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(3) Daniel's argument of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_guarding_in_humans&quot;&gt;Mate-Guarding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel's claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_guarding_in_humans&quot;&gt;Mate-Guarding&lt;/a&gt; is a part of human evolution and even of apes is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Bonobo apes, unlike other apes, do not practice mate-guarding. This behavior is influenced by their environment, where food is abundant and competition for mates is not as intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even among chimpanzees, females engage in relations with multiple males despite the concept of mate-guarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In human societies, there have been and still are several cultures where a woman can have multiple husbands, as seen in this link (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry#:%7E:text=Polyandry%20has%20been%20practised%20in,only%20among%20higher%20caste%20women.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, look at the Inuit culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/inuit-social-organization%3E&quot;&gt;The Canadian Encyclopedia: &quot;Inuit: Social Organization&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - This article states, &quot;When a man left his home for an extended period, a neighbor or friend took care of his family, including his wife. Children born from such arrangements were considered equal members of the household.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uaf.edu/anthropology/faculty/dietz/inuit_culture_and_society/%3E&quot;&gt;The University of Alaska Fairbanks' &quot;Inuit Culture and Society&quot; page&lt;/a&gt; - This resource notes, &quot;Inuit families were often fluid and flexible, with children being raised by multiple caregivers. When a man had to leave his home for an extended period, a neighbor or friend would take care of his family, including his wife. Children born from these arrangements were considered full members of the household.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples show that mate-guarding is not a universal behavior among animals or humans, and various cultural practices and environmental factors influence mating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, in Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Swapping of slave women is also allowed (i.e. two masters can swap their slave girls, and rape them without their consent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;A Muslim master can take the slave-wife of his male slave from him, and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, he can return her to his male slave. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;And if a slave woman is shared between multiple masters, and they do sex with her one by one, then the child will have officially multiple fathers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And it is the right of the owner either to accept the child from his slave women as his own or to deny the child his name. In this case, that child will be called a Bastard (Islamic Terminology is &quot;Walad al-Haram ولد الحرام&quot;), and the child becomes the slave of his own father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read this detailed article for swapping, shared slave women and parentage of a child from a slave woman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery Against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam has no problem with men having sex with 4 wives and dozens of slave girls (which he can rotate by selling older slave girls and buying new slave girls). Thus, Islam denies any mate-guarding in the case of men. It allows men to enjoy their lives. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Islam didn't allow Muslim men to buy and rape new slave girls out of any &lt;strong&gt;NECESSITY&lt;/strong&gt;, but it allowed them in order to fulfil their &lt;strong&gt;LUST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;What about the poor male slave who could not mate guard his wife, and the owner took his wife away from him and raped her? What kind of Islamic Mate Guauding is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And in mate guarding, the males didn't hand over their females to other males after &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; sexual relationships. But Islam allows the owner to have a &quot;temporary&quot; sexual relationship with his slave girl, and after fulfilling his lust, he can hand her over to his brother or slave, or sell her to another master. Therefore, this trait of Islam is not even counted as mate guarding, but Islam is only guarding men and their lust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Islam only comes into play when it needs to place restrictions on women in the name of mate guarding. The sole excuse is that women should not be allowed to enjoy their lives while there is an issue of determining the paternity of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the issue of paternity can be easily resolved with modern medical tests and DNA. Yet, Muslims still refuse to allow women to enjoy their lives and instead force them to wait for their husbands (even if they are preoccupied with other wives or slave girls, or if they are weak in sex and cannot satisfy them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older women or those who are already pregnant have no chance of becoming pregnant again. Nevertheless, Islam denies them any opportunity to enjoy their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be acceptable if both partners agreed to be exclusive in their marriage or partnership. However, Islam has become one-sided, permitting men to have multiple sexual partners while imposing restrictions solely on women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel's claim is based on the notion that only men bear financial responsibilities for children. Therefore, women should not have the authority to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the right to decide on abortion is not about a child, but about a fetus. The fetus has not yet been born, so there is no question of financial responsibility. Furthermore, only women have to endure the entire nine-month pregnancy, including the associated risks and discomforts. Consequently, the right to decide about abortion belongs exclusively to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Daniel's perspective overlooks the practices in Western countries. In these societies, when a woman earns income, she also shares the financial responsibility for the child, just like the father does. If the woman earns more than the father, her financial contribution may exceed his. Moreover, custody decisions are based on the best interests of the child, regardless of the gender of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, women have the same responsibilities concerning their children as fathers do. If a father takes care of the children, the mother is expected to provide financial support to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of pregnancy and delivery, only women have to endure the painful process, while husbands do not have a role in this biological aspect. Therefore, it is logical that women should have the right to make decisions regarding delivery or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, even if we were to accept that Islam places the burden of financial responsibility squarely on the shoulders of fathers, this would only serve to highlight the inherent flaws in the system. Under Islamic law, a father remains financially liable for his children and wife, even if he becomes impoverished or severely disabled and unable to work. On the other hand, a wealthy wife is not obligated to contribute financially to her husband's needs or those of her children. This glaring disparity raises questions about the fairness and balance of the Islamic system. Why, then, do Islamic apologists boast about such an unjust arrangement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Islamic system is further criticized for declaring the wife and children as the property of the man under the guise of the husband's financial responsibility. He can beat his wife, even with bruises&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=20&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;), but the poor wife cannot take divorce on the basis of this brutal beating&lt;/span&gt;. And he can also beat children, and if he kills them, still he will not be physically punished for that, as children are considered his property in Islam. Unbelievable. Please read our article: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=154&amp;amp;catid=35&quot;&gt;A child is the father's property in Islamic Sharia, thus the father cannot be physically punished for killing his child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, due to this unjust financial responsibility imposed solely on fathers, Islam seeks to deprive women of their right in making choices regarding delivery or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId399691&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(5) Depression is all-time high in Islamic countries like Pakistan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel's conclusion about Western people suffering more from depression than in Islamic countries is unsubstantiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of depression in Islamic countries, like Pakistan, is significant higher, as indicated in this research: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728784/#:~:text=Depression%20is%20a%20debilitating%20mood,at%2047%25%20%5B8%5D&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728784/#:~:text=Depression%20is%20a%20debilitating%20mood,at%2047%25%20%5B8%5D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the depression of women in Islamic countries is often underreported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, people experienced depression even with simple restrictions like wearing a mask. In contrast, Muslim women are required to wear the whole Hijab (and even Niqab). It is natural that the Hijab and Niqab are a source of extreme depression for a lot of Muslim women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Muslim women are discouraged from leaving their homes, and face discomfort when venturing outside. Their freedom of movement is limited, causing them to experience distressing situations when they are outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, also think about the depression that slave women had to suffer due to Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their masters could rape them against their consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their masters could hand them over to any of their brothers or male slaves to rape them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The master could break their family life, take the slave wife from his male slaves, and rape her. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The masters could separate the slave mothers from their children, and sell them (or their babies) in the Bazaars of Islamic slavery after the child had got 2 teeth (at 6 months approximately). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad allowed his followers to rape the captive minor and virgin girls the first night, although they had killed their fathers and brothers during the daytime. Just imagine the trauma those poor girls had to endure in that situation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There is an extensive list of documented crimes committed by Islam against humanity concerning the treatment of slave girls. For more in-depth information, please refer to our detailed article titled: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In addition to this, Daniel's claim regarding the higher suicide rate in Western countries as evidence of Western women being in depression is incorrect. Studies have shown that Western people tend to report higher levels of happiness compared to individuals in Islamic countries. However, in cases where individuals are suffering from severe illnesses and have lost interest in life, they may seek the right to Euthanasia (which some Muslims mistakenly label as suicide). Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=118&amp;amp;catid=17&quot;&gt;Suicide: Why the rate of suicide is higher in the Atheist Community?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId188243&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(6) Daniel claims that EQUAL human rights for women are the reason for the higher Divorce rate in Western countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel argues that equal human rights for women are behind the high divorce rates in Western nations. However, a closer examination of affluent Islamic countries like Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia tells a different story. Despite women lacking equal rights in these societies, the divorce rate exceeds 50%, surpassing that of numerous non-Muslim Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It appears that wealth alone can drive up the divorce rate, regardless of gender equality. When women become financially independent, they refuse to tolerate exploitation. Meanwhile, the Islamic system perpetuates the subjugation of women, treating them as mere slaves. Perhaps Muslims should follow through on this logic and enslave their women entirely; that way, they could achieve a zero divorce rate while Islam gives absolutely no human rights to slave women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at Pakistan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Pakistan is at the top in the search for INCEST Porn in the world (for the last 2 decades).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;80% of child girls are raped by their fathers, brothers, cousins, uncles, and grandfathers. Their cases are not even registered in the police stations. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=10&amp;amp;catid=9&quot;&gt;Incest in Islamic Pakistan.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Pakistan is at the top in search of terms like &quot;donkey rape&quot; on Google. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thousands of children are being raped in Quran Schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Women are molested by mobs. This thing never happens in Western countries. It may be individual men indulge in abuses against women, but never a mob of men molest a woman. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim women are even molested during Hajj (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220114154056/https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/s3v9fb/sexual_assault_during_hajj/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While western women at disco parties and beaches are safer from molestation than Muslim women during Hajj gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read our articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId918743&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(8) Apologist Argument: If Muslim states enforce the Hijab for women, then Western countries also impose restrictions on public nudity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with Muslim preachers is their denial of the &quot;Evolution of Dress,&quot; which is a factual phenomenon. The evolution of dress began as a response to weather conditions, as our ancestors migrated to colder or hotter regions. They needed clothing for protection against extreme temperatures, while modern humans lost their body hair, leaving them vulnerable to the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the way people dressed became a symbol of status, with women from wealthy families covering themselves more, while women from poorer families or slaves often remained naked or partially clothed. This evolution eventually turned into a fashion trend. The lower class people, including slaves, often wore little to no clothing, and the upper class wore very luxurious clothing. Clothing norms evolved from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothing has an interesting history, but it wasn’t originally invented for “modesty” reasons. Actually, ancient people had no issue with clothing at all, and dress codes became established relatively recently on a human history timescale. It was these dress codes that led to the cultural aversion in some places of people being naked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question arises: Why do Muslim preachers solely use Western countries as their example? They should also consider indigenous tribes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newatlantisline&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) that have practised &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;Naturism&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. a lifestyle of practising non-sexual social &lt;a title=&quot;Nudity&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity&quot;&gt;nudity&lt;/a&gt; in private and in public) for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these tribes move naked in public without any dress, they still maintain a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;strong family system&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;These tribes don’t have rape and sexual assault as a big issue within them, and men and women see each other COMPLETELY NAKED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Compared to this, millions of Muslim women experience extreme molestation in Muslim countries despite wearing the Hijab. Even during the most religious Hajj gatherings, Muslim girls are exposed to extreme molestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1d00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read all details in this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western countries, too, have experienced a gradual evolution of dress. Influenced by the Christian religion for centuries, many Westerners still adhere to conservative dress codes. However, there is a growing movement of naturists in these countries, leading to the establishment of hundreds of nude beaches where nudity is completely normalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Denmark, nudism is permitted along 4,500 kilometres of coastline (where kids are also present along with families), and the same applies to other Scandinavian countries (source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/naturists-in-scandinavia/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/naturists-in-scandinavia/&lt;/a&gt;). While private offices and government institutions may have specific dress codes, in your personal life, you are even free to wear a bikini in public places. Despite the presence of bikinis in public or even total nudity on beaches, women in Western countries are not subjected to molestation and generally enjoy a safer environment compared to Muslim women, who unfortunately face instances of molestation even during Hajj gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, there is technically no law about nudity in Denmark. There is a relevant law, though, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;It is forbidden to display obscene or offensive behavior, that is likely to offend others or to outrage bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;Here’s the Danish text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;Det er forbudt at udvise uanstændig eller anstødelig opførsel, der er egnet til at forulempe andre eller vække offentlig forargelse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;The relevant word is “likely”. This makes the application of the law highly situational. Except for religious people in Denmark, other people will probably soon stop getting offended even if others move totally nude in public. It is just like indigenous tribes move naked and it is totally NORMAL for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Here is an introduction to the history of Nudity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;history of nudity&lt;/b&gt; involves social attitudes to nakedness of the human body in different cultures in history. The use of clothing to cover the body is one of the changes that mark the end of the Neolithic, and the beginning of civilizations. Nudity (or near-complete nudity) has traditionally been the social norm for both men and women in hunter-gatherer cultures in warm climates, and it is still common among many indigenous peoples. The need to cover the body is associated with human migration out of the tropics into climates where clothes were needed as protection from sun, heat, and dust in the Middle East; or from cold and rain in Europe and Asia. The first use of animal skins and cloth may have been as adornment, along with body modification, body painting, and jewelry, invented first for other purposes, such as magic, decoration, cult, or prestige. The skills used in their making were later found to be practical as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern societies, complete nudity in public became increasingly rare as nakedness became associated with lower status, but the mild Mediterranean climate allowed for a minimum of clothing, and in a number of ancient cultures, the athletic and/or cultist nudity of men and boys was a natural concept. In &lt;a title=&quot;Ancient Greece&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece&quot;&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;, nudity became associated with the perfection of the gods. In &lt;a title=&quot;Ancient Rome&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome&quot;&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;, complete nudity could be a public disgrace, though it could be seen at the public baths or in erotic art. In the Western world, with the spread of Christianity, any positive associations with nudity were replaced with concepts of sin and shame. Although rediscovery of Greek ideals in the Renaissance restored &lt;a title=&quot;Nude (art)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_%28art%29&quot;&gt;the nude&lt;/a&gt; to symbolic meaning in art, by the &lt;a title=&quot;Victorian era&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era&quot;&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt;, public nakedness was considered obscene. In Asia, public nudity has been viewed as a violation of social propriety rather than sin; embarrassing rather than shameful. However, in &lt;a title=&quot;Tokugawa shogunate&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, mixed-gender communal bathing was quite normal and commonplace until the &lt;a title=&quot;Meiji Restoration&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration&quot;&gt;Meiji Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the upper classes had turned clothing into &lt;a title=&quot;Fashion&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion&quot;&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;, those who could not afford otherwise continued to swim or bathe openly in natural bodies of water or frequent communal baths through the 19th century. Acceptance of public nudity re-emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosophically based movements, particularly in Germany, opposed the rise of industrialization. &lt;a title=&quot;Freikörperkultur&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freik%C3%B6rperkultur&quot;&gt;Freikörperkultur&lt;/a&gt; (Free Body Culture) represented a return to nature and the elimination of shame. In the 1960s &lt;a title=&quot;Naturism&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;naturism&lt;/a&gt; moved from being a small subculture to part of a general rejection of restrictions on the body. Women reasserted the right to uncover their breasts in public, which had been the norm until the 17th century. The trend continued in much of Europe, with the establishment of many clothing-optional areas in parks and on beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all of the historical changes in the &lt;a title=&quot;Developed country&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country&quot;&gt;developed countries&lt;/a&gt;, cultures in the tropical climates of &lt;a title=&quot;Sub-Saharan Africa&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa&quot;&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon rainforest&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest&quot;&gt;Amazon rainforest&lt;/a&gt; have continued with their traditional practices, being partially or completely nude during everyday activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId985135&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(9) Islam itself Practiced NUDITY (and the worst form of it while it was a FORCED Nudity)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic Preachers totally forget these realities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It was Islam who made slave women move in public topless. There were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad and in public with naked breasts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat them with a stick for taking Hijab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by taking the Hijab. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is 1300 year long history of Islam where slave women had to stay topless. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And Islam turned poor slave women into sexual objects too, and Muslim men were given licences to fulfil their sexual lusts by raping them. They were presented in that naked state in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery, where Muslim customers were also allowed to touch their private parts (just like sheep and cattle are groped before purchase). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And Muslim men were molesting slave women, without any fear of physical punishment, while Allah (i.e. Muhammad) didn't punish or even rebuked them for molesting slave women. Muslim men were raping slave girls in Temporary Sexual Relationships, and selling them, in order to buy new slave girls to rape them too. They were even buying small non-adult girls from slave markets to use them as sexual objects. They were swapping their slave girls and raping them. In short, Islamic Sharia turned Muslim men into serial rapists legally by giving them full control over the poor slave girls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see all proofs in these two articles: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId323910&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(10) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;Naturism&lt;/a&gt; in Western countries is totally different from the Islamic forced nakedness of slave women and their rape:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturism is not about sex, but it is based upon respect for humans and their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can force a woman to become topless or nude. And forget about rape, no one is allowed to even touch a woman without her consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturism is associated with absolutely no evil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers who blame Naturism for the rise in divorce rates in Western countries are mistaken. Indigenous tribes have practiced Naturism for centuries and still maintain strong family systems and successful marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual reasons behind the increasing divorce rates in Western countries differ. Advancements in technology and societal structures have made life more manageable for people, reducing their reliance on family support. This convenience has contributed to the higher divorce rates. If challenging times were to resurface and people once again required family support for survival, the family system would naturally strengthen once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is evident in Gulf Muslim countries where the divorce rate has reached 50%, even surpassing some Western countries. Despite practicing no Naturism and adhering to full Hijab, the high divorce rate is attributed to the fact that people in these affluent Gulf countries do not necessarily rely on strong family systems to sustain themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribal system, much like the family system, was robust in the past when people depended on their tribes for survival. However, in modern times, especially in cities, the tribal system has diminished as a society no longer requires tribal support to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId354264&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(11) The case of Hijab in the Islamic countries is totally Opposite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Naturist Movement in Western countries is not compelling Muslim women to become topless, but it is liberating all humans. It is about human rights and respecting one's choice for his/her dressing. Modesty and decency are not hidden in the Hijab, but modesty and decency are to &lt;strong&gt;RESPECT&lt;/strong&gt; the women and their choices. The Western world is the most decent, as it educates men to &lt;b&gt;RESPECT&lt;/b&gt; women and their choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the issue of the Hijab in Islamic countries is totally opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic Hijab is plagued by several evils:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first evil is the blatant discrimination and humiliation it inflicts on millions of slave women. Islamic Sharia historically prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab, reserving it only for free Muslim women as a symbol of respect and honor. Muslim women today should not view the Hijab as a personal choice but should stand with us in protesting against this extreme injustice faced by millions of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second evil of the Islamic Hijab is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hijab is practically IMPOSED by force upon the private lives of millions of women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a TOOL in the hands of men, in order to take away their liberties and make them dependent upon men so that men can exploit them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hijab is used in order to usurp the basic human rights of women. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Hijab's demands of women extend to limiting their movement within the confines of their homes, forbidding unnecessary interactions with men. This gender segregation breeds further problems, leading men to fetishize even the smallest glimpses of women's bodies due to the lack of normal exposure. The restrictions imposed by the Hijab and Islamic modesty contribute to sexual frustration among Muslim men and hinder natural interactions between men and women, preventing understanding and respectful treatment. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Please read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Islamic Hijab &amp;amp; Modesty حياء leads only towards Sexual Frustration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, a natural emotion, is stifled by the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء). Islam disapproves of love stories like Layla and Majnun (comparable to Romeo and Juliet) and severely punishes individuals involved in love. Islam employs the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء) to suppress and control this natural emotion, reflecting an approach contrary to embracing nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Islamic practice, girls are practically coerced into marrying men they have never interacted with or know little about their mentality and personality. This not only makes the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء) oppressive but also qualifies as crimes against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imposition of the Hijab transforms women's lives into a constant struggle, subjecting them to numerous hardships daily. To witness the actual ramifications of these evils, please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=4&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Negative role of 'Hijab' and 'Islamic Modesty' in the incident of Ifk&lt;/a&gt; (Highly recommended)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId554334&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(12) Muslim Youth in Islamic Societies have no chance to get rid of their Sexual Frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In earlier centuries, Muslim men had opportunities to interact with the opposite sex, while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There were thousands of slave women present in public (and even their breasts were naked).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslim men also raping the slave women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And even Muhammad was moving in public while holding the hands of slave girls of other men (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6072&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6072&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4177&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 4177&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern times, the existence of slave women, thanks to the influence of the Western world, is no longer prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Muslim boys face challenges in getting married until they reach around 30 years of age. They often prioritize obtaining an education, securing a stable job, and saving a significant amount of money for dowry, also known as Haq Mehr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unnatural restrictions imposed by Islam on the interaction between the opposite sexes inevitably result in extreme sexual frustration among Muslim youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incident from the time of Muhammad, the Sahaba (companions), highlights the struggle of controlling their desires. Initially, Muhammad/Allah forbade them from having sexual relations with their wives during the nights of Ramadan. However, unable to cope, the Sahaba secretly visited their wives during Ramadan nights. Eventually, Muhammad/Allah had to revoke this order and permit the Sahaba to engage in sexual activity during Ramadan nights. This incident is documented in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surah Al-Baqarah (2:187)&lt;br /&gt;“It is (now) made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting) ... Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves (by going to wives secretly), so He turned to you and forgave you (for this sin). So now you are allowed to have sexual relations with your wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/urn/178360&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4508&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Al-Bara': When the order of compulsory fasting of Ramadan was revealed, the people did not have sexual relations with their wives for the whole month of Ramadan, but some men cheated themselves (by violating that restriction). So Allah revealed: &quot;Allah is aware that you were deceiving yourselves but He accepted your repentance and forgave you..&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inability of Sahaba to control their sexual desires for 30 nights during Ramadan raises questions about how Muslim youth today can possibly suppress their desires for an extended period of 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim preachers suggest fasting as a means to control sexual desires, but it's evident that even Sahaba, who were also fasting during Ramadan, struggled with their desires for those 30 nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Muslim argument is to marry boys and girls at the age of 12. However, this is not practical, as even Muhammad himself did not marry until the age of 25. Many fathers do not wish for their daughters to marry someone who is not financially stable. No father wants his daughter to face hunger. No father wants her daughter to become a baby-producing machine at the age of 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These realities lead to extreme sexual frustration in Islamic societies, with no apparent solution to escape this issue. The problem persists and poses significant challenges to Muslim youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women should have the freedom to choose what works best for them, whether that means being a stay-at-home mom or pursuing a career. If a woman wants or needs to work, it doesn’t inherently harm the child. In fact, research has highlighted several benefits for children raised by working mothers, including positive role modelling and fostering independence. Please see the following scientific study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017018760167#.WwxcIdoRW9Q.twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Scientific Study: There are countless benefits to being raised by working women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few years of a child’s life are critical for emotional, cognitive, and social development. Both parents, especially the mother, should prioritize spending quality time with their baby during this phase. Ideally, workplaces should provide at least 1-2 years of maternity leave, followed by part-time or flexible options for an additional year or two, allowing parents to focus on their child without sacrificing career aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://wtop.com/parenting/2017/05/why-prioritizing-motherhood-in-the-first-three-years-is-critical/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Why prioritizing motherhood in first 3 years is critical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;http://adaanbar.com/how-long-to-stay-home-with-baby/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;How Long to Stay Home with Baby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial years, the focus on parenting can shift to a more scheduled approach, ensuring that the child continues to receive adequate attention. Mothers shouldn’t feel obligated to stay home permanently, as effective parenting isn’t about always being present physically but about being emotionally and mentally available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;irstly,&lt;/b&gt; men also go to work. Does it break the bond between fathers and children? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secondly,&lt;/b&gt; Muslim men had 4 wives and dozens of slave women for sex purposes, and then dozens of children from them. They saw their children after long periods of time. Did that break the bond between them and their children? If not, how the mother/child bond is going to break if the mother goes to work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Moreover, many Muslim men from poor countries like India, Pakistan etc. go to rich Gulf countries for work, and stay there for years. They hardly see their children once a year. Does it break the bond between them and their children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thirdly&lt;/b&gt;, Islam broke the families of male and female slaves. Islam has the evil of “&lt;b&gt;Slavery by Birth&lt;/b&gt;”. And when a baby has 2 teeth (6 to 8 months), then the owner can separate the baby and sell the child or slave mother, or both in the Islam Bazaars of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book Risala:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Alvi Nastaleeq;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;ur-PK&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arabic Typesetting, cursive;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A slave-mother and her baby could not be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) till the baby has his second tooth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;As far as the father (i.e. male slave) is concerned, then he can be sold by the owner whenever he wishes, even before the birth of his baby (i.e. the poor slave father didn't even get the chance to see his baby and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Allah/Muhammad also allowed the master to snatch away the wife of his slave, and to start raping her, thus, destroying the whole slave family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot; data-ve-attributes=&quot;{&amp;quot;rel&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;mw:ExtLink&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Nikah:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ (25) Chapter: &quot;Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters...&quot;]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. &lt;strong&gt;But there is no problem if a man (i.e. the owner) takes his (married) female slave (for himself) from his male slave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note: This is our own translation, as&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;Sunnah.Com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;provides only the Arabic text, but didn't translate it into English]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;PS:&lt;/b&gt; slave women in Islam are always working for their masters and cannot stay with their children at home. But it seems Islam don't consider slaves to be human beings. &lt;/p&gt;

Ideally, workplaces should provide at least 1-2 years of maternity leave, followed by part-time or flexible options for an additional year or two, allowing parents to focus on their child without sacrificing career aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://wtop.com/parenting/2017/05/why-prioritizing-motherhood-in-the-first-three-years-is-critical/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Why prioritizing motherhood in first 3 years is critical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial years, the focus on parenting can shift to a more scheduled approach, ensuring that the child continues to receive adequate attention. Mothers shouldn’t feel obligated to stay home permanently, as effective parenting isn’t about always being present physically but about being emotionally and mentally available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;irstly,&lt;/b&gt; men also go to work. Does it break the bond between fathers and children? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secondly,&lt;/b&gt; Muslim men had 4 wives and dozens of slave women for sex purposes, and then dozens of children from them. They saw their children after long periods of time. Did that break the bond between them and their children? If not, how the mother/child bond is going to break if the mother goes to work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Moreover, many Muslim men from poor countries like India, Pakistan etc. go to rich Gulf countries for work, and stay there for years. They hardly see their children once a year. Does it break the bond between them and their children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thirdly&lt;/b&gt;, Islam broke the families of male and female slaves. Islam has the evil of “&lt;b&gt;Slavery by Birth&lt;/b&gt;”. And when a baby has 2 teeth (6 to 8 months), then the owner can separate the baby and sell the child or slave mother, or both in the Islam Bazaars of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book Risala:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Alvi Nastaleeq;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;ur-PK&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arabic Typesetting, cursive;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A slave-mother and her baby could not be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) till the baby has his second tooth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;As far as the father (i.e. male slave) is concerned, then he can be sold by the owner whenever he wishes, even before the birth of his baby (i.e. the poor slave father didn't even get the chance to see his baby and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Allah/Muhammad also allowed the master to snatch away the wife of his slave, and to start raping her, thus, destroying the whole slave family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot; data-ve-attributes=&quot;{&amp;quot;rel&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;mw:ExtLink&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Nikah:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ (25) Chapter: &quot;Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters...&quot;]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. &lt;strong&gt;But there is no problem if a man (i.e. the owner) takes his (married) female slave (for himself) from his male slave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note: This is our own translation, as&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;Sunnah.Com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;provides only the Arabic text, but didn't translate it into English]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;PS:&lt;/b&gt; slave women in Islam are always working for their masters and cannot stay with their children at home. But it seems Islam don't consider slaves to be human beings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a top medical journal, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;minor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; marriage and childbirth is very safe throughout the world, far safer than marriage and childbirth after age 29. Existing data indicates that marriage and childbirth at early ages &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #2800ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(e.g., 15-19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is extremely safe. The data suggest that if we want to name and shame cultures for endangering women, we should stigmatize those (liberal) cultures which encourage marriage and childbirth after ages 20-25 - as danger to women rapidly increases after this age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/daniel_minor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Danial: 15 to 20 years old MINOR girls&quot; width=&quot;473&quot; height=&quot;522&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/daniel_minor.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Answer: It is not about being a &quot;minor&quot;, but about the &quot;age of consent&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear People, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please understand that the religion of Islam works as a cult, where its followers are very easily manipulated and deceived by Islamic preachers like Daniel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel is very clearly deceiving them by calling 15 to 20 years old girls &quot;&lt;strong&gt;minors&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; in this matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term of &quot;minor&quot; in the world is used for LEGAL issues (like drinking, driving licence, crimes etc.). And it is 18 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, the issue is about the &quot;marriage&quot;, and it is not about being a minor, but it is about the &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;age of consent&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;And this &quot;age of consent&quot; in Europe and almost all over the world is 16 years&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/ages-of-consent-around-world-countries-laws-japan-sexual-abuse-b1061907.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, his Muslim followers are not in a position to figure out this deception, while religion makes people often blind. This is the main reason why religions are so successful in brainwashing their followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam allows men to marry minor girls, and penetration in their vaginas starts at the age of 8 or 9 years or even earlier if they think that the prepubescent girl is strong enough to bear the pain of penetration. Nevertheless, men (neither the father of the girl nor the husband nor any medical doctor) are in a position to find out if an 8 or 9 or 10  years old girl is ready for penetration. This results often in the painful suffering of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula#:~:text=A%20vaginal%20fistula%20is%20an,and%20other%20irritative%20type%20symptoms.&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viginal Fistula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among girls (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vaginal fistula is an abnormal opening between the vagina and other nearby organs in the pelvis, including the bladder or rectum. A fistula can cause many complications, such as urinary and fecal leakage, abnormal vaginal discharge, tissue damage, kidney infections and other irritative type symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his promotion of minor marriage, Daniel promotes impregnating 9 or 10 year olds to &quot;extend the fertility window&quot;, through the practice of marriage to an old man marrying, or having sex with 9 years old prepubescent girls. He calls it to be a tradition (Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Youtube Video of Daniel Haqiqatjou&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Daniel really wants to defend the Sharia Ruling of having sex with minor girls, then he should bring a scientific study which deals with girls from 9 years and onwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, this study of 15 to 19 years old girls (which Daniel mentioned) is also not showing accurate results. We know that in almost all countries of the world, marriage is legal only after 18 years. Thus, most of the girls in this group of 15-19 years are actually getting married at the age of 18 or 19 years, while some of them may be between 16 to 17 years too, but there are only a few who marry at the age of 15 and get babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childbirth is still dangerous at the age of 15 years, as it becomes clear from other studies. For example, look at the following study: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;. ......girls aged &lt;span style=&quot;color: #2800ff;&quot;&gt;15 or under&lt;/span&gt; had an odds ratio for maternal death &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;four times higher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Vaginal Fistula, please read this study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, the high mortality rate among children from teen mothers is not the only problem, but they suffer from other horrific health problems too, the whole of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Child&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children of teen mothers are at higher risk of intellectual, language, and socio-emotional delays.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Day_2009_30-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Day_2009-30&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Developmental disability&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability&quot;&gt;Developmental disabilities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Behavior&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior&quot;&gt;behavioral&lt;/a&gt; issues are increased in children born to teen mothers.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-34&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-34&quot;&gt;[34]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One study suggested that adolescent mothers are less likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Stimulation&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation&quot;&gt;stimulate&lt;/a&gt; their infant through &lt;a title=&quot;Affection&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection&quot;&gt;affectionate behaviors&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a title=&quot;Haptic communication&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_communication&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Smile&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile&quot;&gt;smiling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&quot;Linguistics&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics&quot;&gt;verbal communication&lt;/a&gt;, or to be &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sensitivity (human)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_(human)&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Acceptance&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance&quot;&gt;accepting&lt;/a&gt; toward their needs.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Grade (education)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)&quot;&gt;academic performance&lt;/a&gt; in the children of teenage mothers has also been noted, with many of the children being held back a grade level, scoring lower on standardized tests, and/or failing to graduate from secondary school.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-natcamp_26-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-natcamp-26&quot;&gt;[26]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Sentence (law)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)&quot;&gt;serve time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title=&quot;Prison&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-37&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-37&quot;&gt;[37]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is all this Data Islamophobic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in the Western world don't hesitate to get children after the age of 29, while medical facilities have made childbirth safer even after 29 years. It is reflected in the chart itself, that Daniel presented. The link to the direct scientific study is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307723764_Maternal_mortality_in_adolescents_compared_with_women_of_other_ages_evidence_from_144_countries&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;h2&gt;Answer: It is not about being a &quot;minor&quot;, but about the &quot;age of consent&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

Nevertheless, men (neither the father of the girl nor the husband nor any medical doctor) are in a position to find out if an 8 or 9 or 10  years old girl is ready for penetration. This results often in the painful suffering of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula#:~:text=A%20vaginal%20fistula%20is%20an,and%20other%20irritative%20type%20symptoms.&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viginal Fistula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among girls (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vaginal fistula is an abnormal opening between the vagina and other nearby organs in the pelvis, including the bladder or rectum. A fistula can cause many complications, such as urinary and fecal leakage, abnormal vaginal discharge, tissue damage, kidney infections and other irritative type symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his promotion of minor marriage, Daniel promotes impregnating 9 or 10 year olds to &quot;extend the fertility window&quot;, through the practice of marriage to an old man marrying, or having sex with 9 years old prepubescent girls. He calls it to be a tradition (Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Youtube Video of Daniel Haqiqatjou&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Daniel really wants to defend the Sharia Ruling of having sex with minor girls, then he should bring a scientific study which deals with girls from 9 years and onwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, this study of 15 to 19 years old girls (which Daniel mentioned) is also not showing accurate results. We know that in almost all countries of the world, marriage is legal only after 18 years. Thus, most of the girls in this group of 15-19 years are actually getting married at the age of 18 or 19 years, while some of them may be between 16 to 17 years too, but there are only a few who marry at the age of 15 and get babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childbirth is still dangerous at the age of 15 years, as it becomes clear from other studies. For example, look at the following study: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;. ......girls aged &lt;span style=&quot;color: #2800ff;&quot;&gt;15 or under&lt;/span&gt; had an odds ratio for maternal death &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;four times higher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Vaginal Fistula, please read this study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, the high mortality rate among children from teen mothers is not the only problem, but they suffer from other horrific health problems too, the whole of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Child&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children of teen mothers are at higher risk of intellectual, language, and socio-emotional delays.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Day_2009_30-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Day_2009-30&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Developmental disability&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability&quot;&gt;Developmental disabilities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Behavior&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior&quot;&gt;behavioral&lt;/a&gt; issues are increased in children born to teen mothers.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-34&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-34&quot;&gt;[34]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One study suggested that adolescent mothers are less likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Stimulation&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation&quot;&gt;stimulate&lt;/a&gt; their infant through &lt;a title=&quot;Affection&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection&quot;&gt;affectionate behaviors&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a title=&quot;Haptic communication&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_communication&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Smile&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile&quot;&gt;smiling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&quot;Linguistics&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics&quot;&gt;verbal communication&lt;/a&gt;, or to be &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sensitivity (human)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_(human)&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Acceptance&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance&quot;&gt;accepting&lt;/a&gt; toward their needs.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Grade (education)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)&quot;&gt;academic performance&lt;/a&gt; in the children of teenage mothers has also been noted, with many of the children being held back a grade level, scoring lower on standardized tests, and/or failing to graduate from secondary school.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-natcamp_26-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-natcamp-26&quot;&gt;[26]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Sentence (law)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)&quot;&gt;serve time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title=&quot;Prison&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-37&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-37&quot;&gt;[37]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is all this Data Islamophobic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in the Western world don't hesitate to get children after the age of 29, while medical facilities have made childbirth safer even after 29 years. It is reflected in the chart itself, that Daniel presented. The link to the direct scientific study is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307723764_Maternal_mortality_in_adolescents_compared_with_women_of_other_ages_evidence_from_144_countries&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Aisha was fortunate in a way that she was handed over to Muhammad at the age of nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While the actual Islamic Ruling is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Even a breastfed small baby girl can be married, and her husband can undress her, and take every kind of sexual pleasure with her naked body (like kissing her naked body and rubbing his penis in her thighs to ejaculate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;And if the Husband thinks she is strong enough at any age before puberty (may it be 6 or 7 years or later) to bear the pain of penetration in her vagina, then he can also penetrate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt; And if the husband makes a mistake and harms the minor girl by penetrating her vagina, still he has committed no sin or crime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic website &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/islamweb.net&quot;&gt;islamweb.net&lt;/a&gt; gave this fatwa (link &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160129102417/http://fatwa.islamweb.net/fatwa/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;amp;lang=A&amp;amp;Id=78529&amp;amp;Option=FatwaId&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/minor_wife_pleasure_islamwebNet.pdf&quot;&gt;2, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210410223048/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/77718/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shamela.ws/book/27107/72618&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;فإنه لا حرج في تقبيل الزوجة ‌الصغيرة بشهوة ‌والمفاخذة ونحو ذلك ولو كانت لا تطيق الجماع، وقد بين العلماء رحمهم الله تعالى أن الأصل جواز استمتاع الرجل بزوجته كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر، وذكروا في ذلك استمناءه بيدها ومداعبتها وتقبيلها وغير ذلك&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no issue in the sexual kissing, thighing..etc of a minor wife, even if she can't yet endure sexual intercourse. Scholars have stated that the default ruling is that a man can enjoy his wife however he wants as long as no harm is caused. The examples they mentioned for this include masturbating with her hand, fondling, kissing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
Reference:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another one of the largest Websites for Muslims is Islamonline.net, which says a similar thing (link &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20100125211912/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-Arabic-Ask_Scholar/FatwaA/FatwaA&amp;amp;cid=1122528623306&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/minor_wife_thighing2.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فإنه لا ضررَ في الإنزالِ بين فخذي الصغيرة التي لا تطيقُ الجماع وتتضررُ به إذا كان ذلك الإنزالُ بدونِ إيلاج، وقد بَيَّنَ العلماءُ أن الأصلَ هو جوازُ استمتاعِ الرجلِ بزوجتِه كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر&lt;br&gt;There is no problem if husband rubs his penis between the thighs of minor girl in order to ejaculate the sperm, even the minor girl does not possess the ability for penetration... According to the Islamic Scholars husband is allowed to enjoy the minor wife in every possible way till the time she is not harmed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A free minor girl may have some protection that her father does not hand her over to her husband till she is 9 years old, or strong enough to bear the penetration. Nevertheless, minor slave girls in Islam were totally vulnerable and they had no fathers there to protect them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim men got their hands upon minor slave girls by making them captives through wars, or directly buying them from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (also known as the younger Imam Malik) wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A slave-mother and her baby could be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) after baby has his two molar tooth (i.e. about 6 months)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A mother could only weep the tears of blood if her 6 months old baby is separated from her and sold in the slave market and then used for sexual pleasure by the Muslim owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (who is also known as the younger Imam Malik), writes in his Fiqh book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;واستبراء الامة في انتقال الملك حيضة انتقل الملك ببيع أو هبة أو سبي أو غير ذلك. ومن هي في حيازته قدحاضت عنده ثم إنه اشتراها فلا استبراء عليها إن لم تكن تخرج. واستبراء الصغيرة في البيع إن كانت توطأ ثلاثة أشهر&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Istibra (i.e. waiting period) of a slave woman during the transfer of ownership occurs through sale, gift, capture, or other means. If a person possesses a slave woman who is menstruating, and then he purchases her, there is no requirement for Istibra (i.e. waiting period) ....&lt;strong&gt; As for the Istibra (waiting period) of a minor slave girl through sale is concerned, then it is three months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Imam Ibn Qayyam al-Jawziyya recorded (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150512090314/http://islamport.com/w/qym/Web/3181/859.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;في الفصول روى عن أحمد في رجل خاف أن تنشق مثانته من الشبق أو تنشق انثياه لحبس الماء في زمن رمضان يستخرج الماء ولم يذكر بأي شيء يستخرجه قال: “وعندي أنه يستخرجه بما لا يفسد صوم غيره كاستمنائه بيده أو ببدن زوجته أو أمته غير الصائمة فإن كان له أمة طفلة أو صغيرة استمنى بيدها وكذلك الكافرة ويجوز وطؤها فيما دون الفرج فإن أراد الوطء في الفرج مع إمكان إخراج الماء بغيره فعندي أنه لا يجوز لأن الضرورة إذا رفعت حرام ما وراءها&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmed said about a man who feared that sperm would flow from his penis or that his testicles were unable to retain semen during Ramadan, he can ejaculate. But he didn’t say with what. In my opinion, he must release it with what would not spoil the fast of others. Like masturbating with his hand, or against the body of his wife or a slave who is not fasting. &lt;strong&gt;If he has a child or a small slave, let him masturbate with her hand&lt;/strong&gt;. The Same for the unbelieving woman, he can penetrate her but not in her vagina. But if he wants to penetrate her vagina while he has other options to ejaculate, this would not be allowed in my opinion. If the need is fulfilled, it is forbidden to go beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam handed over captive minor girls to Jihadists, where they were alone in their tents and fully on their mercy. There was no one to stop them from raping these small captive girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was a regular practice of Muhammad's Companions to rape minor PRISONER girls. Ali raped a minor captive girl on the same night when she was made captive after the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Istibra &lt;/em&gt;is a period of sexual abstinence required till the first period of the captive girl is over. This is to ensure no confusion on paternity. Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.&lt;br&gt;As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ولم ير الحسن بأسا أن يقبلها أو يباشرها. وقال ابن عمر ـ رضى الله عنهما ـ إذا وهبت الوليدة التي توطأ أو بيعت أو عتقت فليستبرأ رحمها بحيضة، ولا تستبرأ العذراء. وقال عطاء لا بأس أن يصيب من جاريته الحامل ما دون الفرج.&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;Al-Hasan did not see any harm in kissing or having sexual intercourse with a female slave. Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: &quot;If a female slave who has been engaged in sexual intercourse is given as a gift, sold, or freed, she should be purified by waiting for her menstrual cycle. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;virgin&lt;/span&gt; does not require purification &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0005ff; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;(i.e. the minor girls are also virgins)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;  And Atta said if a slave woman had become pregnant (from the earlier owner/husband), then still pleasure could be derived from whole of her body, except for her vagina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Risala is a famous treatise of Maliki fiqh (jurisprudence). It says the same i.e. virgin woman (including virgin minor girls) don't need any waiting period and can be raped immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/lawbase/risalah_maliki/book33.html&quot;&gt;The Risalah, 33:5 (Maliki Fiqh)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istibra' is observed in the case of a slavegirl who changes ownership. It is one menstruation. Ownership changes by selling, giving away, capture, or any other way. If the woman menstruates after being in the possession of the new master (i.e. she was a minor girl) before he has bought her, then &lt;strong&gt;she does not have to observe an istibra' if she has not gone out&lt;/strong&gt;. The istibra' for a child when she is sold is three months as it is for a woman who no longer menstruates. &lt;strong&gt;There is no istibra' for a woman who has never had intercourse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please imagine the profound trauma endured by the small girls who experienced the unimaginable horrors inflicted upon them. In a single day, they tragically lost their fathers and brothers to Muslims. Shortly thereafter, they were forcibly expelled from their homes, subjected to looting by the same perpetrators. To compound their suffering, they were then cruelly torn apart from their mothers on that very same night and then they were raped by Jihadists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad didn't even grant the poor small girls the period of one month to come out of the shock of the killing of their fathers and brothers (like the Jews/Christians did), before raping them &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;(link).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any God really exists, then can He ever bring such shame to humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many people have lost all their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and all their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; due to religious brainwashing. They still come out and start defending Islam against this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ugliest crime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which it committed against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the practice of Companions and all Muslims of the last 1400 years, till the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secular non-religious West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; saved humanity against these evil religious practices of slavery and raping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If she has not reached the age of puberty, then her father has the sole right to arrange her marriage and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;does not have to ask her permission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to a virgin who is still a minor, &lt;strong&gt;there is no difference of opinion&lt;/strong&gt; concerning her (i.e., that her father may marry her off &lt;strong&gt;even if she objects&lt;/strong&gt;). Ibn al-Mundhir said: &lt;strong&gt;Every scholar&lt;/strong&gt; from whom we learned was agreed that it is permissible for a man to marry off his virgin daughter who is still a minor, if he marries her to someone who is compatible, and it is permissible for him to marry her off &lt;strong&gt;even if she objects and refuses&lt;/strong&gt;.” Al-Mughni, 9/398&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId151488&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Verse 65:4 proves marriage with small prepubescent girls is Halal Allah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain juncture, it becomes necessary to transcend the 1400-year-old tenets of Sharia law. There are no alternative paths available to us. For example, the Quran says that even a minor girl (under the age of 9) could be married and penetrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quranwebsite.com/text55/065___at_talaq.html&quot;&gt;Quran 65:4&lt;/a&gt;) And if you are in doubt about those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, (you should know that) their waiting period is three months,&lt;b&gt; and the same applies to those (minor girls) who have not menstruated as yet&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modoudi's Tafseer of verse 65:4 (&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=65&amp;amp;verse=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They may not have menstruated as yet &lt;b&gt;either because of young age&lt;/b&gt;, or delayed menstrual discharge as it happens in the case of some women, the waiting-period of such a woman is the same as of the woman, who has stopped menstruation, that is three months from the time divorce was pronounced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here, one should bear in mind the fact that according to the explanations given in the Qur'an the question of the waiting period arises in respect of the women with whom marriage may have been consummated, for there is no waiting-period in case divorce is pronounced before the consummation of marriage. (Al-Ahzab: 49). Therefore, making mention of the waiting-period for the girls who have not yet menstruated, clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl in marriage at this age but it is also permssible for the husband to consummate marriage with her. Now, obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Qur'an has held as permissible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubay bin Ka`b said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger! Some women were not mentioned in the Qur'an, the young (who yet not menstruate), the old (who don't menstruate due to old age) and the pregnant women.'' Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah (ie. verse 65:4) وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ {Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses (due to young age}&lt;br&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a simpler narration than this one from Ubay bin Ka`b who said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger! When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur'an. There are the young (who yet not menstruate), the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.' Later on, this Ayah 65:4 was revealed,  وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ   (Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses (due to young age).)''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;والآثار الدالة على اشتهار الزواج المبكر في عهد الصحابة من غير نكير كثيرة  فقد  زوج علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله عنه ابنته أم كلثوم من عمر بن الخطاب  رضي الله عنه  وقد ولدت له قبل موت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم  وتزوجها عمر رضي الله عنه وهي صغيرة لم تبلغ بعد، رواه عبد الرزاق في المصنف، وابن سعد في &quot;الطبقات&quot;. وعن عروة بن الزبير: أن الزبير رضي الله عنه زوج ابنة له صغيرة حين ولدت. رواه سعيد بن منصور في سننه، وابن أبي شيبة في المصنف بإسناد صحيح. وقال الشافعي في &quot;كتاب الأم&quot;: وزوج غير واحد من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ابنته صغيرة. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many evidences of the popularity of early marriage during the time of the Companions. Ali ibn Abi Talib, married his daughter Umm Kulthum to Omar ibn al-Khattab. She was born to him before the death of the Prophet. Omar, may God be pleased with him, married her when she was young and had not reached puberty yet. It was narrated by Abd al-Razzaq in al-Musannaf, and Ibn Sa`d in al-Tabaqat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is narrated on the authority of Urwa bin Al-Zubayr: Al-Zubayr, may God be pleased with him, married his young daughter when she was born. It was narrated by Saeed bin Mansour in his Sunan, and Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf &lt;strong&gt;with an authentic chain of narrators&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Shafi’i said in his book “Kitab al-Umm”: And more than one of the companions of the Messenger of God, married their young daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the largest Muslim Fatwa website Islam Questions Answers says there is a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #fc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus (i.e. Ijma)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; upon it among all the Salaf (i.e. early) generations of Muslims:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/12708&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/12708&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage to a young girl &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; she reaches puberty is permissible according to sharee’ah, and it was narrated that there was scholarly &lt;b&gt;consensus &lt;/b&gt;on this point (i.e. All jurists along with 4 Imams agree upon it) ... &lt;b&gt;The scholars are (also) unanimously agreed (Ijma) that a father may marry off his young (minor) daughter without consulting her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another place, this same Saudi Mufti writes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/27305&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/27305&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If she has not reached the age of puberty, &lt;strong&gt;then her father has the sole right to arrange her marriage and does not have to ask her permission&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to a virgin who is still a minor, there is no difference of opinion concerning her (i.e., that her father may marry her off even if she objects). Ibn al-Mundhir said: Every scholar from whom we learned was agreed that it is permissible for a man to marry off his virgin daughter who is still a minor, if he marries her to someone who is compatible, &lt;strong&gt;and it is permissible for him to marry her off even if she objects and refuses&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;i&gt;Al-Mughni&lt;/i&gt;, 9/398&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another place, this same Saudi Mufti writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قال ابن عبد البر  رحمه الله :&quot; أجمع العلماء على أن للأب أن يزوِّج ابنته الصغيرة ، ولا يشاورها، وأن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم تزوَّج عائشة بنت أبي بكر ، وهي صغيرة بنت ست سنين ، أو سبع سنين ، أنكحه إياها أبوها &quot; انتهى من &quot; الاستذكار &quot; ( 16 / 49 ). وقال ابن حجر – رحمه الله - : &quot; والبكر الصغيرة يزوِّجها أبوها اتفاقاً ، إلا من شذ &quot; انتهى من &quot; فتح الباري &quot; ( 9 / 239 ) . ....  وإذا زوج الأب ابنته الصغيرة غير البالغة، فلا خيار لها إذا بلغت .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ... Ibn Abd al-Barr, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;Scholars unanimously agree that a father has the right to marry off his young daughter without her consent, and he is not required to consult her. The Prophet, peace be upon him, married Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, when she was a young girl of six or seven, and her father married her to him.&quot; (See &quot;Al-Istidhkar&quot; 16/49). Ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;The young virgin girl can be married off by her father without her consent, except in rare cases.&quot; (See &quot;Fath al-Bari&quot; 9/239) ... If the father marries off his non-adult daughter, she has no choice once she reaches adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a fatwa from a Hanafi Deoband Mufti (&lt;a href=&quot;https://darulifta-deoband.com/home/ur/Womens-Issues/68723&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Question:&lt;br&gt;Is it allowed to penetrate into a wife who is still a minor-girl? ....&lt;br&gt;Answer:&lt;br&gt;....Yes, it is allowed to penetrate into a wife who is still a minor-girl, nevertheless guardians of the minor girl should keep it in mind and marry her by keeping this issue in their minds ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ٰImam Nawawi wrote in his Sharh of Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://seekersguidance.org/answers/shafii-fiqh/marriage-with-a-minor/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وأما وقت زفاف الصغيرة المزوجة والدخول بها : فإن اتفق الزوج والولي على شيء لا ضرر فيه على الصغيرة : عُمل به ، وإن اختلفا : فقال أحمد وأبو عبيد : تجبر على ذلك بنت تسع سنين دون غيرها ، وقال مالك والشافعي وأبو حنيفة : حدُّ ذلك أن تطيق الجماع ، ويختلف ذلك باختلافهن ، ولا يضبط بسنٍّ ، وهذا هو الصحيح&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the sleeping with a minor age wife and having intercourse with her, if the husband and the guardian of the wife agreed upon something that is not harmful for the minor age wife, it is legitimate and if they did not agree upon then Ahmad and Aboo Ubayd say that &lt;strong&gt;if she is at nine years of age she can be forced to (do intercourse with her husban)&lt;/strong&gt;, not the younger ones, &lt;strong&gt;and Malik and Shafi’i and Aboo Hanifah say that the criteria is that she can bear intercourse (even if she is younger than 9)&lt;/strong&gt;, and the differences of opinion about this issue comes from these scholars. But the correct opinion is that it does not depend upon age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus of Sahaba (companions) that a father can wed his minor daughter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://al-maktaba.org/book/31621/13351&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;نُقل الإجماع على جواز تزويج الأب البكر الصغيرة – على الأقل إجماع الصحابة – وممن نقل الإجماع: الإمام أحمد في ” المسائل ” – رواية صالح – (3/ 129) والمروزي في ” اختلاف العلماء ” (ص 125)، وابن المنذر في ” الإجماع ” (ص91) وابن عبد البر في ” التمهيد “، والبغوي في ” شرح السنة ” (9/ 37) والنووي في ” شرح مسلم ” (9/ 206) وابن حجر في” الفتح ” (12/ 27)، والباجي في ” المنتقى ” (3/ 272)، وابن العربي في ” عارضة الأحوذي ” (5/ 25)، والشنقيطي في ” مواهب الجليل ” (3/ 27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The consensus was transmitted on the permissibility of a father marrying off the minor Virgin girl&lt;/strong&gt; – at least the consensus of the Companions – and among those who transmitted the consensus were: Imam Ahmad in “Al-Masseel” – riwayat salih – (3/129) and Al-Marwazi in “aikhtilaf al-ulama” (p. 125), and Ibn Al-Mundhir in “al-ijma” (p. 91) and Ibn Abd al-Barr in “Al-Tamheed”, al-Baghawi in “Sharh al-Sunnah” (9/37), al-Nawawi in “Sharh Muslim” (9/206), Ibn Hajar in “Al-Fath” (12/27), and al-Baji in “Al-Muntaqa” (3/272), Ibn al-Arabi in “Ardah al-Ahwadhi” (5/25), and al-Shinqiti in “Mawahib al-Jaleel” (3/27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId238305&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Imam Bukhari on Nikah with minor child girl:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bukhari gave the following heading to the chapter about the marriage of Aisha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Marriage (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;باب إِنْكَاحِ الرَّجُلِ وَلَدَهُ الصِّغَارَ&lt;br&gt;A man can give his minor daughter in marriage &lt;br&gt;لِقَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى: {وَاللاَّئِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ} فَجَعَلَ عِدَّتَهَا ثَلاَثَةَ أَشْهُرٍ قَبْلَ الْبُلُوغِ.&lt;br&gt;Allah said (in Quran 65:4): ... and for those minor girls who didn't start mensturating. This means their waiting period is 3 months&lt;br&gt;عَنْ عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَزَوَّجَهَا وَهْىَ بِنْتُ سِتِّ سِنِينَ، وَأُدْخِلَتْ عَلَيْهِ وَهْىَ بِنْتُ تِسْعٍ، وَمَكَثَتْ عِنْدَهُ تِسْعًا‏.‏&lt;br&gt;Narrated `Aisha:&lt;br&gt;that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani writes in his commentary of Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210810235618/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=9288&amp;amp;idto=9289&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2819&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot; يجوز تزويج الصغيرة بالكبير إجماعا ولو كانت في المهد&quot;&lt;br&gt;There is a consensus&lt;strong&gt; (Ijma)&lt;/strong&gt; that an adult man can marry any minor girl, even if she is &lt;strong&gt;so small that she is in a cradle&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bukhari also recorded that a woman had already become a grandmother at the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/0/2524/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%D8%BA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;باب بلوغ الصبيان وشهادتهم وقول الله تعالى وإذا بلغ الأطفال منكم الحلم فليستأذنوا وقال مغيرة احتلمت وأنا ابن ثنتي عشرة سنة وبلوغ النساء في الحيض لقوله عز وجل واللائي يئسن من المحيض من نسائكم إلى قوله أن يضعن حملهن وقال الحسن بن صالح أدركت جارة لنا جدة بنت إحدى وعشرين سنة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Hasan bin Saleh said, &quot;I saw one of my neighbors who had become a grandmother at the age of twenty-one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId872200&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Verse 4:3 also proves marriage with small girls is fully allowed in Islam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a minor orphan girl is in the guardianship of any man, then he can marry her even without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(Quran 4:3) And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Nikah (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150429191013/http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated Aisha&quot;:&lt;br&gt;(regarding) the Verse: 'And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans...' (4.3) &lt;strong&gt;It is about the (minor) orphan girl who is in the custody of a man (due to her minor age)&lt;/strong&gt; who is her guardian, and he intends to marry her because of her wealth, but he treats her badly and does not manage her property fairly and honestly. Such a man should marry women of his liking other than her.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a risk of permanent damage to a minor girl due to penetration. Her vagina and anus may become one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We read in &lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-0-0&quot;&gt;Fatawa Alamgiri (Authentic Book of Hanafi Fiqh) (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_1FRfMxEAy__7c8vezYv9qP&quot; href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210511052345if_/https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/184874820_951508122055452_3185058016773267725_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;amp;ccb=1-3&amp;amp;_nc_sid=730e14&amp;amp;_nc_ohc=lA1__sB1cLwAX9-ecS6&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx&amp;amp;oh=58e06e6045d59d845b51f994c7745c3c&amp;amp;oe=60BF5E30&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-1-0&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-2-0&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; Sharia Law book titled &quot;Reliance of the Traveler&quot;( or Umdat al Salik in Arabic), which is one of the most renowned classical manuals of fiqh, on page 592 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Reliance_traveler.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Indemnity for Bodily Injuries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A full indemnity is also paid for injuries which paralyze these members,&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; or for injuring the peritoneal wall between the vagina and rectum (anus) so they become one aperture&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forced penetration by an adult man to the underage girl causes her small vagina to rupture and rip apart up to her rectum. It is known as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=vaginal+fistula&amp;amp;oq=vagin&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i512l4j69i60j69i61.1646j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Fistula&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in medical terminology.&lt;br&gt;You can imagine the pain that the little girl suffers because of this action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another Sharia book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062229/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Behisti_Zewar.jpg&quot;&gt;Heavenly Ornaments or Bahisti Zewar (page 50)&lt;/a&gt; that also mentions this type of injury. The paragraph talks about ghusl or ritual washing after having intercourse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;If a woman is underage but not so small that if one has intercourse with her &lt;strong&gt;there is a fear of the vaginal tissues tearing to such an extent that the vagina and anus will virtually come together&lt;/strong&gt;; then by the insertion of the glans of the penis into her vagina ghusl will become Fardh (i.e. obligatory) on the man if he has reached the age of puberty. However, if there is the aforementioned fear in a very minor girl, then mere insertion of the penis does not render ghusl obligatory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if the man is an adult and he is worried that inserting his genitalia into a prepubescent, or infant or a baby girl can cause the tearing of the vagina to the anus, then just insert the head of his penis. .... Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can read a similar explanation from another Sharia book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062510/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Digest_Muhammad_law.jpg&quot;&gt;A Digest of Moohummudan Law, Part II, translated by Neil Baillie. This is about the Marriage Law in Islam, page 26&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;When a man has had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of nine years, &lt;strong&gt;and has ruptured the parts (i.e. her vagina, tearing apart because of what the adult man did to her)&lt;/strong&gt;. It is unlawful for him to have further connection with her (i.e. he cannot have a sex with her), &lt;strong&gt;but she is not released from her ties, if connected with him by marriage or slavery&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that if the vagina ruptures, then the man should not continue the coitus. &lt;strong&gt;But that doesn't mean that the girl can divorce the man, if the man is her husband, or that the girl is free if the man is her slave master&lt;/strong&gt;. If no rupture has taken place, the prohibition is not incurred according to the most valid opinion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This means that if no rupture happens, then the man can go ahead to continue with the coitus. But if the rapture happens, then such a girl cannot have sex her entire life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This is DOUBLE cruelty against the poor minor girl:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;First and foremost, she is condemned to endure the anguish and physical trauma of the fistula throughout her entire existence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, she is trapped in a perpetual state of being unable to liberate herself from him through divorce, forced to confront the presence of the abhorrent individual who violated and subjected her to such excruciating torment. This inflicts not only physical agony but also profound mental anguish upon her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the rupture incident is mentioned repeatedly in many Sharia books, means that such horrific accidents happen often during child marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shia Islam: vagina and anus becoming one due to penetration in minor girls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia Islam also allows marriage with a minor girl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia Imam Khomeini wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamicvirtues.com/2013/12/28/deriving-sexual-pleasure-from-infants/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;مسألة 12 : لا يجوز وطء الزوجة قبل إكمال تسع سنين ، دواما كان النكاح أو منقطعا ، و أما سائر الاستمتاعات كاللمس بشهوة و الضم و التفخيذ فلا بأس بها حتى فى الرضيعة ولو وطئها قبل التسع ولم يفضها لم يترتّب عليه شي‏ء غير الإثم على الأقوى، وإن أفضاها - بأن جعل مسلكي البول والحيض واحدا أو مسلكي الحيض والغائط واحدا - حرم عليه وطؤها أبدا، لكن على الأحوط في الصورة الثانية. وعلى أيّ حال لم تخرج عن زوجيّته على الأقوى، فيجري عليها أحكامها من التوارث وحرمة الخامسة وحرمة اُختها معها وغيرها&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tahreer al-Waseelah, volume 2, page 343&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue #12: It is not permissible to have sexual intercourse (with one’s wife) before she reaches 9 years in age, be it in Nikaah (permanent marriage) or Mut’a (temporary marriage). As for all other pleasures such as lustful touch, embracing, and thighing, there is no problem in it, even if she is a suckling baby. A man having intercourse with a girl younger than nine years of age has not committed a crime, but only an infraction, if the girl is not permanently damaged by vagina and anus becoming one. If the girl, however, is permanently damaged, the man must provide for her all her life. But this girl will not count as one of the man's four permanent wives. He also is not permitted to marry the girl's sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Shia Imam Sistani wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2368/&quot;&gt;Ruling 2428&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If a person marries a non-bālighah girl, it is unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her until she has completed nine lunar years. However, if he does have sexual intercourse with her before then, it will not be unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her after she reaches bulūgh even if she has developed a cloacal abnormality (the meaning of which was explained in Ruling 2399). And if she has developed a cloacal abnormality, he must pay her blood money (diyah), which is equivalent to the blood money for killing a human being, and he must also pay for her living expenses forever, even after divorce. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, even if that girl marries someone else after getting divorced [he must still pay for her living expenses] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2367/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloacal abnormality explained in #2399 point 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; “the woman had a cloacal abnormality, meaning that her urethral opening and vagina had become one [vesicovaginal fistula], or her vagina and anus had become one [rectovaginal fistula], or all three had become one [persistent cloaca], …”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the condition of 9 years is only a precaution, while Shia Imams also allowed penetrating her vagina if she is even younger than 9 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read this news (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-childbride-idUSBRE98910N20130910/&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text__text__1FZLe text__dark-grey__3Ml43 text__regular__2N1Xr text__small__1kGq2 body__full_width__ekUdw body__small_body__2vQyf article-body__paragraph__2-BtD&quot; data-testid=&quot;paragraph-0&quot;&gt;SANAA (Reuters) - An eight-year-old Yemeni girl died of internal bleeding on her wedding night after marrying a man five times her age, a social activist and two local residents said, in a case that has caused an outcry in the media and revived debate about child brides. Arwa Othman, head of Yemen House of Folklore and a leading rights campaigner, said the girl, identified only as Rawan, was married to a 40-year-old man late last week in the town of Meedi in Hajjah province in northwestern Yemen. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId580394&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dangers for minor girls if they are used for sexual pleasures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly: The rate of death among “Teen Mothers” and their babies is the highest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole internet is full of this information (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rate of death of Teen Mothers is the highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the rate of death among their babies is also the highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And not only the death rate, but these children also suffer highly from other mental and physical handicaps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And birth becomes very often complicated and OPERATION has to be performed instead of natural birth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly: Psychiatrists are WISER than Allah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam sends a minor girl to an old man of the age of her father and grandfather so that that old man can take sexual pleasure from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Psychiatrists claim that separating a minor girl from her parents, and then sending her alone to an old man for being used as a sexual object, causes a huge psychological depression to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Allah claims that he is the All-Wisest, and he does not do any injustice to such a minor girl, and she is not depressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, who is truthful? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah or these Psychologists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId10537&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Does verse 4:6 prohibit marriage with minor girls?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an Ijma (إجماع i.e. CONSENSUS) of Muslim Ummah that marriage with a minor girl is allowed. But in the present century, few modern Muslim Preachers (and the Quranists, i.e. those who reject Hadith) have started denying it. They are trying to misuse verse 4:6 as an argument to deny marriage to minor girls in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=6&quot;&gt;4:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;وَٱبْتَلُوا۟&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And test the orphans until when they reached the age of marriage (Nikah), then if you perceive in them sound judgement then deliver to them their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Modern Muslim preachers claim that one gets sound judgement about his wealth when one is already an adult person. Thus, this means that Islam prescribed that one can marry only after becoming an adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the word &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Nikah&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah&quot;&gt;Nikah&lt;/a&gt; has a double meaning in the Arabic language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the Islamic Sharia, &quot;Nikah&quot; is a terminology, whose meaning in Islamic Sharia is “marriage”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the literal meaning of “Nikah” in the Arabic language is &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;Nikah (Sexual Consummation of Marriage)&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah_%28Sexual_Consummation_of_Marriage%29&quot;&gt;To do Sexual Intercourse&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes even more evident from another verse of Quran 17:34:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.34?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 17:34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ &lt;b&gt;أَشُدَّهُۥ&lt;/b&gt; ۚ&lt;br&gt;Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of &lt;b&gt;full strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word أَشُدَّهُ (full strength) in this verse means the age when young boys and girls start feeling the desire/strength to do sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as Shar'i Nikah (marriage) is concerned, then there is no condition present in it of reaching the أَشُدَّهُ (i.e. Full Strength to do the act of intercourse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the proof is that prophet Muhammad himself did the Shar'i Nikah with 'Aisha, when she was only 6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And no one tests a 6 years old child for handing over his/her property to him/her, as a 6-year-old child has neither أَشُدَّهُ (Strength/Desire) nor he/she has any kind of “sound judgement” to look after his/her property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Shar'i Nikah has nothing to do with the أَشُدَّهُ (strength), as Muhammad did this Shar'i Nikah with 6 years 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, even at the age of 9, when 'Aisha finally came to the house of Muhammad for the consummation of marriage, she was still not mentally sound enough to look after any property or business. It is evident from the following hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-6130/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 6130:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, according to Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a girl reaches puberty, then she herself gets the right to give her consent for the marriage or to deny the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if she is a minor or prepubescent girl, then her father/guardian could wed her to anyone, even without her consent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if she is prepubescent and also an orphan, then her guardian has the right to wed her with himself (even without her consent), in order to get her property and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5064/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5064:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated 'Urwa: that he asked `Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! &lt;b&gt;(This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr (bride-dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr&lt;/b&gt;, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) &lt;b&gt;to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage&lt;/b&gt;, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reasons that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no longer considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islamqa.com, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet, also refutes these modern Muslim preachers regarding verse 6:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse 4:6 explains that an orphan’s money is given to him/her after they reach puberty and attain sound judgement. What’s meant by sound judgment is sound management of money. This can only happen after puberty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Reaching Nikah” mentioned in the verse means reaching puberty which can be known through sings such as menstruation for females and the growth of pubic hair. The verse used the expression “reaching Nikah” to actually mean “reaching puberty” because in most cases, it’s adults who perform Nikah. But this doesn’t mean that it’s not possible for non-adults to perform Nikah, which is permissible as proven by the Quran, Sunnah and the consensus of scholars. Plus, the same Surah and the same context of verses proves it (the permissibility of child marriage). (The verse that speaks about giving an orphan his money when he/she reaches Nikah is verse no.6) Verse no.3 says: “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. ”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse proves it’s allowed to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of Allah's Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning women..' (4.127) “&lt;a class=&quot;external free&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This shows it’s allowed to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Muslim preachers also come up with this excuse that the word &lt;i&gt;Nisaa'&lt;/i&gt;  refers only to mature, adult women, therefore 65:4 cannot be talking about pre-pubescent females.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-13&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Child_Marriage_in_the_Qur%27an#cite_note-13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This linguistic argument does not hold water, even just on the basis of the Qur'an itself as a text. The word merely means “women/females” and can refer to mixed groups of women of various ages, as the English &quot;female&quot; or &quot;women.&quot; Here are some verses that use the word &lt;i&gt;&quot;nisaa'&quot;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.49?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 2:49&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ ۚ وَفِى ذَٰلِكُم بَلَآءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your (newborn) sons and let your women-folk (i.e. newborn girls) live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 7:127&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ أَتَذَرُ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُۥ لِيُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَءَالِهَتَكَ ۚ قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْىِۦ نِسَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَٰهِرُونَ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Said the chiefs of Pharaoh’s people: “Wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods?” He said: “Their (newborn) male children will we slay; (only) their (newborn) females will we save alive; and we have over them (power) irresistible.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above verses, the word &lt;i&gt;&quot;Nisaa'&quot;&lt;/i&gt; is referring to female infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Quran used the expression “Nisaa’ orphans” to mean “female orphans”. Orphans cannot be adults which means non-adults can be included in the word Nisaa’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;‏ويستفتونك في النساء قل الله يفتيكم فيهن ومايتلى عليكم في الكتاب في يتامى النساء اللاتي لاتؤتونهن ماكتب لهن وترغبون ان تنكحوهن والمستضعفين من الولدان وان تقوموا لليتامى بالقسط وماتفعلوا من خير فان الله كان به عليماThey consult thee concerning women. Say: Allah giveth you decree concerning them, and the Scripture which hath been recited unto you (giveth decree), concerning female orphans and those unto whom ye give not that which is ordained for them though ye desire to marry them, and (concerning) the weak among children, and that ye should deal justly with orphans. Whatever good ye do, lo! Allah is ever Aware of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic Excuse: Shariah didn't stipulate any age for Nikah, so it is a matter of Ijtehaad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Islamic apologist website wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/476539/ruling-on-giving-in-marriage-a-young-girl&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic principle is that there is nothing in Shari‘ah that stipulates a particular age of marriage for the man or the woman. The issue in question, which is related to specifying a particular age for marriage, falls under a general matter, which is: Does the guardian have the right to restrict what is permissible for the public interest? This is one of the matters of ijtihad, so no one should disapprove of it for what his ijtihad has led him to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy on the marriage of young girls reads: &quot;The age of marriage for young girls is determined with the permission of the judge and the matter is left (entrusted) to the ruler in each country according to the circumstances of time, place, and age, in a way that achieves the interest of all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is against Islamic rule that the Halal of Allah cannot be made Haram by any man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Muhammad was not allowed to make Halal of Allah haram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed Muhammad didn't make it to Haram in the incident where a foster father married his adopted daughter for her beauty and wealth. At maximum, Muhammad asked such men in the Quran to do justice and pay full Haq Mahr to their adopted minor daughters, but nothing was made illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why Sahaba were raping minor captive and minor slave girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Islamic history of 14 centuries, no one stipulated sex with minor girls to be Haram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId959348&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Either the Quran supports marriage with minor girls or it's linguistically imperfect and flawed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Just think about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;How can billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years make a mistake about this verse?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Billions of Muslims believe in this Quran from their hearts. They read this Quran and pondered upon it day and night, but still, the modern Islam apologists blame they got misguided despite reading this Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Didn't the Quran claim that its verses are CLEAR and EASY to understand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;But if the modern Quranists/Islamic Apologists claim that the billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years got misguided despite pondering upon it day and night, then it means that Quran is telling a lie that its verses are clear and EASY to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;How can then we believe in such a book which tells lies and make false claims?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at the Quran, which claims that its verses are Clear and Easy to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;easy to understand&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.17&quot;&gt;54:17&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;manifest&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2&quot;&gt;27:1-2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/12.2&quot;&gt;12:2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However according to modern Muslim apologists and the Quranists, then this Quran was neither a guide nor mercy for billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years, as minor girls were being wed and being used for sexual pleasures. And millions of minor slave girls were also bought from the slave markets, and used for sexual pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is then responsible for the plight of these minor girls?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Were really Muslims of the last 1400 years responsible, who were reading this Quran and pondering upon it, and despite that came to absolutely wrong and horrible conclusions? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Or it was the so-called Allah, who was UNABLE to reveal a single clear verse about the rights of minor girls? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Aisha was fortunate in a way that she was handed over to Muhammad at the age of nine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;فإنه لا حرج في تقبيل الزوجة ‌الصغيرة بشهوة ‌والمفاخذة ونحو ذلك ولو كانت لا تطيق الجماع، وقد بين العلماء رحمهم الله تعالى أن الأصل جواز استمتاع الرجل بزوجته كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر، وذكروا في ذلك استمناءه بيدها ومداعبتها وتقبيلها وغير ذلك&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no issue in the sexual kissing, thighing..etc of a minor wife, even if she can't yet endure sexual intercourse. Scholars have stated that the default ruling is that a man can enjoy his wife however he wants as long as no harm is caused. The examples they mentioned for this include masturbating with her hand, fondling, kissing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A free minor girl may have some protection that her father does not hand her over to her husband till she is 9 years old, or strong enough to bear the penetration. Nevertheless, minor slave girls in Islam were totally vulnerable and they had no fathers there to protect them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim men got their hands upon minor slave girls by making them captives through wars, or directly buying them from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (also known as the younger Imam Malik) wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A slave-mother and her baby could be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) after baby has his two molar tooth (i.e. about 6 months)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A mother could only weep the tears of blood if her 6 months old baby is separated from her and sold in the slave market and then used for sexual pleasure by the Muslim owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (who is also known as the younger Imam Malik), writes in his Fiqh book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;واستبراء الامة في انتقال الملك حيضة انتقل الملك ببيع أو هبة أو سبي أو غير ذلك. ومن هي في حيازته قدحاضت عنده ثم إنه اشتراها فلا استبراء عليها إن لم تكن تخرج. واستبراء الصغيرة في البيع إن كانت توطأ ثلاثة أشهر&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Istibra (i.e. waiting period) of a slave woman during the transfer of ownership occurs through sale, gift, capture, or other means. If a person possesses a slave woman who is menstruating, and then he purchases her, there is no requirement for Istibra (i.e. waiting period) ....&lt;strong&gt; As for the Istibra (waiting period) of a minor slave girl through sale is concerned, then it is three months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Imam Ibn Qayyam al-Jawziyya recorded (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150512090314/http://islamport.com/w/qym/Web/3181/859.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;في الفصول روى عن أحمد في رجل خاف أن تنشق مثانته من الشبق أو تنشق انثياه لحبس الماء في زمن رمضان يستخرج الماء ولم يذكر بأي شيء يستخرجه قال: “وعندي أنه يستخرجه بما لا يفسد صوم غيره كاستمنائه بيده أو ببدن زوجته أو أمته غير الصائمة فإن كان له أمة طفلة أو صغيرة استمنى بيدها وكذلك الكافرة ويجوز وطؤها فيما دون الفرج فإن أراد الوطء في الفرج مع إمكان إخراج الماء بغيره فعندي أنه لا يجوز لأن الضرورة إذا رفعت حرام ما وراءها&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmed said about a man who feared that sperm would flow from his penis or that his testicles were unable to retain semen during Ramadan, he can ejaculate. But he didn’t say with what. In my opinion, he must release it with what would not spoil the fast of others. Like masturbating with his hand, or against the body of his wife or a slave who is not fasting. &lt;strong&gt;If he has a child or a small slave, let him masturbate with her hand&lt;/strong&gt;. The Same for the unbelieving woman, he can penetrate her but not in her vagina. But if he wants to penetrate her vagina while he has other options to ejaculate, this would not be allowed in my opinion. If the need is fulfilled, it is forbidden to go beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam handed over captive minor girls to Jihadists, where they were alone in their tents and fully on their mercy. There was no one to stop them from raping these small captive girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was a regular practice of Muhammad's Companions to rape minor PRISONER girls. Ali raped a minor captive girl on the same night when she was made captive after the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Istibra &lt;/em&gt;is a period of sexual abstinence required till the first period of the captive girl is over. This is to ensure no confusion on paternity. Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.&lt;br&gt;As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ولم ير الحسن بأسا أن يقبلها أو يباشرها. وقال ابن عمر ـ رضى الله عنهما ـ إذا وهبت الوليدة التي توطأ أو بيعت أو عتقت فليستبرأ رحمها بحيضة، ولا تستبرأ العذراء. وقال عطاء لا بأس أن يصيب من جاريته الحامل ما دون الفرج.&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;Al-Hasan did not see any harm in kissing or having sexual intercourse with a female slave. Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: &quot;If a female slave who has been engaged in sexual intercourse is given as a gift, sold, or freed, she should be purified by waiting for her menstrual cycle. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;virgin&lt;/span&gt; does not require purification &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0005ff; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;(i.e. the minor girls are also virgins)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;  And Atta said if a slave woman had become pregnant (from the earlier owner/husband), then still pleasure could be derived from whole of her body, except for her vagina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Risala is a famous treatise of Maliki fiqh (jurisprudence). It says the same i.e. virgin woman (including virgin minor girls) don't need any waiting period and can be raped immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/lawbase/risalah_maliki/book33.html&quot;&gt;The Risalah, 33:5 (Maliki Fiqh)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istibra' is observed in the case of a slavegirl who changes ownership. It is one menstruation. Ownership changes by selling, giving away, capture, or any other way. If the woman menstruates after being in the possession of the new master (i.e. she was a minor girl) before he has bought her, then &lt;strong&gt;she does not have to observe an istibra' if she has not gone out&lt;/strong&gt;. The istibra' for a child when she is sold is three months as it is for a woman who no longer menstruates. &lt;strong&gt;There is no istibra' for a woman who has never had intercourse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please imagine the profound trauma endured by the small girls who experienced the unimaginable horrors inflicted upon them. In a single day, they tragically lost their fathers and brothers to Muslims. Shortly thereafter, they were forcibly expelled from their homes, subjected to looting by the same perpetrators. To compound their suffering, they were then cruelly torn apart from their mothers on that very same night and then they were raped by Jihadists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad didn't even grant the poor small girls the period of one month to come out of the shock of the killing of their fathers and brothers (like the Jews/Christians did), before raping them &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;(link).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any God really exists, then can He ever bring such shame to humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many people have lost all their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and all their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; due to religious brainwashing. They still come out and start defending Islam against this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ugliest crime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which it committed against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the practice of Companions and all Muslims of the last 1400 years, till the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secular non-religious West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; saved humanity against these evil religious practices of slavery and raping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If she has not reached the age of puberty, then her father has the sole right to arrange her marriage and&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;does not have to ask her permission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to a virgin who is still a minor, &lt;strong&gt;there is no difference of opinion&lt;/strong&gt; concerning her (i.e., that her father may marry her off &lt;strong&gt;even if she objects&lt;/strong&gt;). Ibn al-Mundhir said: &lt;strong&gt;Every scholar&lt;/strong&gt; from whom we learned was agreed that it is permissible for a man to marry off his virgin daughter who is still a minor, if he marries her to someone who is compatible, and it is permissible for him to marry her off &lt;strong&gt;even if she objects and refuses&lt;/strong&gt;.” Al-Mughni, 9/398&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId151488&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Verse 65:4 proves marriage with small prepubescent girls is Halal Allah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain juncture, it becomes necessary to transcend the 1400-year-old tenets of Sharia law. There are no alternative paths available to us. For example, the Quran says that even a minor girl (under the age of 9) could be married and penetrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quranwebsite.com/text55/065___at_talaq.html&quot;&gt;Quran 65:4&lt;/a&gt;) And if you are in doubt about those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, (you should know that) their waiting period is three months,&lt;b&gt; and the same applies to those (minor girls) who have not menstruated as yet&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modoudi's Tafseer of verse 65:4 (&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=65&amp;amp;verse=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They may not have menstruated as yet &lt;b&gt;either because of young age&lt;/b&gt;, or delayed menstrual discharge as it happens in the case of some women, the waiting-period of such a woman is the same as of the woman, who has stopped menstruation, that is three months from the time divorce was pronounced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here, one should bear in mind the fact that according to the explanations given in the Qur'an the question of the waiting period arises in respect of the women with whom marriage may have been consummated, for there is no waiting-period in case divorce is pronounced before the consummation of marriage. (Al-Ahzab: 49). Therefore, making mention of the waiting-period for the girls who have not yet menstruated, clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl in marriage at this age but it is also permssible for the husband to consummate marriage with her. Now, obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Qur'an has held as permissible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just in case someone tries to claim that Abul A'la al-Maududi is a modern scholar, then here are a few excerpts from other classical exegetes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/afiefh/&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur'an. There are the young (who yet not menstruate), the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.' Later on, this Ayah 65:4 was revealed,  وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ   (Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses (due to young age).)''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;والآثار الدالة على اشتهار الزواج المبكر في عهد الصحابة من غير نكير كثيرة  فقد  زوج علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله عنه ابنته أم كلثوم من عمر بن الخطاب  رضي الله عنه  وقد ولدت له قبل موت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم  وتزوجها عمر رضي الله عنه وهي صغيرة لم تبلغ بعد، رواه عبد الرزاق في المصنف، وابن سعد في &quot;الطبقات&quot;. وعن عروة بن الزبير: أن الزبير رضي الله عنه زوج ابنة له صغيرة حين ولدت. رواه سعيد بن منصور في سننه، وابن أبي شيبة في المصنف بإسناد صحيح. وقال الشافعي في &quot;كتاب الأم&quot;: وزوج غير واحد من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ابنته صغيرة. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many evidences of the popularity of early marriage during the time of the Companions. Ali ibn Abi Talib, married his daughter Umm Kulthum to Omar ibn al-Khattab. She was born to him before the death of the Prophet. Omar, may God be pleased with him, married her when she was young and had not reached puberty yet. It was narrated by Abd al-Razzaq in al-Musannaf, and Ibn Sa`d in al-Tabaqat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is narrated on the authority of Urwa bin Al-Zubayr: Al-Zubayr, may God be pleased with him, married his young daughter when she was born. It was narrated by Saeed bin Mansour in his Sunan, and Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf &lt;strong&gt;with an authentic chain of narrators&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Shafi’i said in his book “Kitab al-Umm”: And more than one of the companions of the Messenger of God, married their young daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the largest Muslim Fatwa website Islam Questions Answers says there is a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #fc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus (i.e. Ijma)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; upon it among all the Salaf (i.e. early) generations of Muslims:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/12708&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/12708&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage to a young girl &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; she reaches puberty is permissible according to sharee’ah, and it was narrated that there was scholarly &lt;b&gt;consensus &lt;/b&gt;on this point (i.e. All jurists along with 4 Imams agree upon it) ... &lt;b&gt;The scholars are (also) unanimously agreed (Ijma) that a father may marry off his young (minor) daughter without consulting her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another place, this same Saudi Mufti writes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/27305&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/27305&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If she has not reached the age of puberty, &lt;strong&gt;then her father has the sole right to arrange her marriage and does not have to ask her permission&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to a virgin who is still a minor, there is no difference of opinion concerning her (i.e., that her father may marry her off even if she objects). Ibn al-Mundhir said: Every scholar from whom we learned was agreed that it is permissible for a man to marry off his virgin daughter who is still a minor, if he marries her to someone who is compatible, &lt;strong&gt;and it is permissible for him to marry her off even if she objects and refuses&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;i&gt;Al-Mughni&lt;/i&gt;, 9/398&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;قال ابن عبد البر  رحمه الله :&quot; أجمع العلماء على أن للأب أن يزوِّج ابنته الصغيرة ، ولا يشاورها، وأن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم تزوَّج عائشة بنت أبي بكر ، وهي صغيرة بنت ست سنين ، أو سبع سنين ، أنكحه إياها أبوها &quot; انتهى من &quot; الاستذكار &quot; ( 16 / 49 ). وقال ابن حجر – رحمه الله - : &quot; والبكر الصغيرة يزوِّجها أبوها اتفاقاً ، إلا من شذ &quot; انتهى من &quot; فتح الباري &quot; ( 9 / 239 ) . ....  وإذا زوج الأب ابنته الصغيرة غير البالغة، فلا خيار لها إذا بلغت .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ... Ibn Abd al-Barr, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;Scholars unanimously agree that a father has the right to marry off his young daughter without her consent, and he is not required to consult her. The Prophet, peace be upon him, married Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, when she was a young girl of six or seven, and her father married her to him.&quot; (See &quot;Al-Istidhkar&quot; 16/49). Ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;The young virgin girl can be married off by her father without her consent, except in rare cases.&quot; (See &quot;Fath al-Bari&quot; 9/239) ... If the father marries off his non-adult daughter, she has no choice once she reaches adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a fatwa from a Hanafi Deoband Mufti (&lt;a href=&quot;https://darulifta-deoband.com/home/ur/Womens-Issues/68723&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Question:&lt;br&gt;Is it allowed to penetrate into a wife who is still a minor-girl? ....&lt;br&gt;Answer:&lt;br&gt;....Yes, it is allowed to penetrate into a wife who is still a minor-girl, nevertheless guardians of the minor girl should keep it in mind and marry her by keeping this issue in their minds ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ٰImam Nawawi wrote in his Sharh of Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://seekersguidance.org/answers/shafii-fiqh/marriage-with-a-minor/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وأما وقت زفاف الصغيرة المزوجة والدخول بها : فإن اتفق الزوج والولي على شيء لا ضرر فيه على الصغيرة : عُمل به ، وإن اختلفا : فقال أحمد وأبو عبيد : تجبر على ذلك بنت تسع سنين دون غيرها ، وقال مالك والشافعي وأبو حنيفة : حدُّ ذلك أن تطيق الجماع ، ويختلف ذلك باختلافهن ، ولا يضبط بسنٍّ ، وهذا هو الصحيح&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the sleeping with a minor age wife and having intercourse with her, if the husband and the guardian of the wife agreed upon something that is not harmful for the minor age wife, it is legitimate and if they did not agree upon then Ahmad and Aboo Ubayd say that &lt;strong&gt;if she is at nine years of age she can be forced to (do intercourse with her husban)&lt;/strong&gt;, not the younger ones, &lt;strong&gt;and Malik and Shafi’i and Aboo Hanifah say that the criteria is that she can bear intercourse (even if she is younger than 9)&lt;/strong&gt;, and the differences of opinion about this issue comes from these scholars. But the correct opinion is that it does not depend upon age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus of Sahaba (companions) that a father can wed his minor daughter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://al-maktaba.org/book/31621/13351&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;نُقل الإجماع على جواز تزويج الأب البكر الصغيرة – على الأقل إجماع الصحابة – وممن نقل الإجماع: الإمام أحمد في ” المسائل ” – رواية صالح – (3/ 129) والمروزي في ” اختلاف العلماء ” (ص 125)، وابن المنذر في ” الإجماع ” (ص91) وابن عبد البر في ” التمهيد “، والبغوي في ” شرح السنة ” (9/ 37) والنووي في ” شرح مسلم ” (9/ 206) وابن حجر في” الفتح ” (12/ 27)، والباجي في ” المنتقى ” (3/ 272)، وابن العربي في ” عارضة الأحوذي ” (5/ 25)، والشنقيطي في ” مواهب الجليل ” (3/ 27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The consensus was transmitted on the permissibility of a father marrying off the minor Virgin girl&lt;/strong&gt; – at least the consensus of the Companions – and among those who transmitted the consensus were: Imam Ahmad in “Al-Masseel” – riwayat salih – (3/129) and Al-Marwazi in “aikhtilaf al-ulama” (p. 125), and Ibn Al-Mundhir in “al-ijma” (p. 91) and Ibn Abd al-Barr in “Al-Tamheed”, al-Baghawi in “Sharh al-Sunnah” (9/37), al-Nawawi in “Sharh Muslim” (9/206), Ibn Hajar in “Al-Fath” (12/27), and al-Baji in “Al-Muntaqa” (3/272), Ibn al-Arabi in “Ardah al-Ahwadhi” (5/25), and al-Shinqiti in “Mawahib al-Jaleel” (3/27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId238305&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Imam Bukhari on Nikah with minor child girl:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bukhari gave the following heading to the chapter about the marriage of Aisha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Marriage (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;باب إِنْكَاحِ الرَّجُلِ وَلَدَهُ الصِّغَارَ&lt;br&gt;A man can give his minor daughter in marriage &lt;br&gt;لِقَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى: {وَاللاَّئِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ} فَجَعَلَ عِدَّتَهَا ثَلاَثَةَ أَشْهُرٍ قَبْلَ الْبُلُوغِ.&lt;br&gt;Allah said (in Quran 65:4): ... and for those minor girls who didn't start mensturating. This means their waiting period is 3 months&lt;br&gt;عَنْ عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَزَوَّجَهَا وَهْىَ بِنْتُ سِتِّ سِنِينَ، وَأُدْخِلَتْ عَلَيْهِ وَهْىَ بِنْتُ تِسْعٍ، وَمَكَثَتْ عِنْدَهُ تِسْعًا‏.‏&lt;br&gt;Narrated `Aisha:&lt;br&gt;that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani writes in his commentary of Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210810235618/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=9288&amp;amp;idto=9289&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2819&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot; يجوز تزويج الصغيرة بالكبير إجماعا ولو كانت في المهد&quot;&lt;br&gt;There is a consensus&lt;strong&gt; (Ijma)&lt;/strong&gt; that an adult man can marry any minor girl, even if she is &lt;strong&gt;so small that she is in a cradle&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bukhari also recorded that a woman had already become a grandmother at the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/0/2524/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%D8%BA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;باب بلوغ الصبيان وشهادتهم وقول الله تعالى وإذا بلغ الأطفال منكم الحلم فليستأذنوا وقال مغيرة احتلمت وأنا ابن ثنتي عشرة سنة وبلوغ النساء في الحيض لقوله عز وجل واللائي يئسن من المحيض من نسائكم إلى قوله أن يضعن حملهن وقال الحسن بن صالح أدركت جارة لنا جدة بنت إحدى وعشرين سنة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Hasan bin Saleh said, &quot;I saw one of my neighbors who had become a grandmother at the age of twenty-one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId872200&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Verse 4:3 also proves marriage with small girls is fully allowed in Islam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a minor orphan girl is in the guardianship of any man, then he can marry her even without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(Quran 4:3) And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Nikah (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150429191013/http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated Aisha&quot;:&lt;br&gt;(regarding) the Verse: 'And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans...' (4.3) &lt;strong&gt;It is about the (minor) orphan girl who is in the custody of a man (due to her minor age)&lt;/strong&gt; who is her guardian, and he intends to marry her because of her wealth, but he treats her badly and does not manage her property fairly and honestly. Such a man should marry women of his liking other than her.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a risk of permanent damage to a minor girl due to penetration. Her vagina and anus may become one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We read in &lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-0-0&quot;&gt;Fatawa Alamgiri (Authentic Book of Hanafi Fiqh) (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_1FRfMxEAy__7c8vezYv9qP&quot; href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210511052345if_/https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/184874820_951508122055452_3185058016773267725_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;amp;ccb=1-3&amp;amp;_nc_sid=730e14&amp;amp;_nc_ohc=lA1__sB1cLwAX9-ecS6&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx&amp;amp;oh=58e06e6045d59d845b51f994c7745c3c&amp;amp;oe=60BF5E30&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-1-0&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-2-0&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; Sharia Law book titled &quot;Reliance of the Traveler&quot;( or Umdat al Salik in Arabic), which is one of the most renowned classical manuals of fiqh, on page 592 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Reliance_traveler.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Indemnity for Bodily Injuries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A full indemnity is also paid for injuries which paralyze these members,&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; or for injuring the peritoneal wall between the vagina and rectum (anus) so they become one aperture&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forced penetration by an adult man to the underage girl causes her small vagina to rupture and rip apart up to her rectum. It is known as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=vaginal+fistula&amp;amp;oq=vagin&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i512l4j69i60j69i61.1646j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Fistula&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in medical terminology.&lt;br&gt;You can imagine the pain that the little girl suffers because of this action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another Sharia book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062229/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Behisti_Zewar.jpg&quot;&gt;Heavenly Ornaments or Bahisti Zewar (page 50)&lt;/a&gt; that also mentions this type of injury. The paragraph talks about ghusl or ritual washing after having intercourse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;If a woman is underage but not so small that if one has intercourse with her &lt;strong&gt;there is a fear of the vaginal tissues tearing to such an extent that the vagina and anus will virtually come together&lt;/strong&gt;; then by the insertion of the glans of the penis into her vagina ghusl will become Fardh (i.e. obligatory) on the man if he has reached the age of puberty. However, if there is the aforementioned fear in a very minor girl, then mere insertion of the penis does not render ghusl obligatory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if the man is an adult and he is worried that inserting his genitalia into a prepubescent, or infant or a baby girl can cause the tearing of the vagina to the anus, then just insert the head of his penis. .... Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can read a similar explanation from another Sharia book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062510/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Digest_Muhammad_law.jpg&quot;&gt;A Digest of Moohummudan Law, Part II, translated by Neil Baillie. This is about the Marriage Law in Islam, page 26&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;When a man has had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of nine years, &lt;strong&gt;and has ruptured the parts (i.e. her vagina, tearing apart because of what the adult man did to her)&lt;/strong&gt;. It is unlawful for him to have further connection with her (i.e. he cannot have a sex with her), &lt;strong&gt;but she is not released from her ties, if connected with him by marriage or slavery&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that if the vagina ruptures, then the man should not continue the coitus. &lt;strong&gt;But that doesn't mean that the girl can divorce the man, if the man is her husband, or that the girl is free if the man is her slave master&lt;/strong&gt;. If no rupture has taken place, the prohibition is not incurred according to the most valid opinion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This means that if no rupture happens, then the man can go ahead to continue with the coitus. But if the rapture happens, then such a girl cannot have sex her entire life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This is DOUBLE cruelty against the poor minor girl:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;First and foremost, she is condemned to endure the anguish and physical trauma of the fistula throughout her entire existence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, she is trapped in a perpetual state of being unable to liberate herself from him through divorce, forced to confront the presence of the abhorrent individual who violated and subjected her to such excruciating torment. This inflicts not only physical agony but also profound mental anguish upon her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the rupture incident is mentioned repeatedly in many Sharia books, means that such horrific accidents happen often during child marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shia Islam: vagina and anus becoming one due to penetration in minor girls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia Islam also allows marriage with a minor girl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia Imam Khomeini wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamicvirtues.com/2013/12/28/deriving-sexual-pleasure-from-infants/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;مسألة 12 : لا يجوز وطء الزوجة قبل إكمال تسع سنين ، دواما كان النكاح أو منقطعا ، و أما سائر الاستمتاعات كاللمس بشهوة و الضم و التفخيذ فلا بأس بها حتى فى الرضيعة ولو وطئها قبل التسع ولم يفضها لم يترتّب عليه شي‏ء غير الإثم على الأقوى، وإن أفضاها - بأن جعل مسلكي البول والحيض واحدا أو مسلكي الحيض والغائط واحدا - حرم عليه وطؤها أبدا، لكن على الأحوط في الصورة الثانية. وعلى أيّ حال لم تخرج عن زوجيّته على الأقوى، فيجري عليها أحكامها من التوارث وحرمة الخامسة وحرمة اُختها معها وغيرها&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tahreer al-Waseelah, volume 2, page 343&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue #12: It is not permissible to have sexual intercourse (with one’s wife) before she reaches 9 years in age, be it in Nikaah (permanent marriage) or Mut’a (temporary marriage). As for all other pleasures such as lustful touch, embracing, and thighing, there is no problem in it, even if she is a suckling baby. A man having intercourse with a girl younger than nine years of age has not committed a crime, but only an infraction, if the girl is not permanently damaged by vagina and anus becoming one. If the girl, however, is permanently damaged, the man must provide for her all her life. But this girl will not count as one of the man's four permanent wives. He also is not permitted to marry the girl's sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Shia Imam Sistani wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2368/&quot;&gt;Ruling 2428&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If a person marries a non-bālighah girl, it is unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her until she has completed nine lunar years. However, if he does have sexual intercourse with her before then, it will not be unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her after she reaches bulūgh even if she has developed a cloacal abnormality (the meaning of which was explained in Ruling 2399). And if she has developed a cloacal abnormality, he must pay her blood money (diyah), which is equivalent to the blood money for killing a human being, and he must also pay for her living expenses forever, even after divorce. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, even if that girl marries someone else after getting divorced [he must still pay for her living expenses] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2367/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloacal abnormality explained in #2399 point 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; “the woman had a cloacal abnormality, meaning that her urethral opening and vagina had become one [vesicovaginal fistula], or her vagina and anus had become one [rectovaginal fistula], or all three had become one [persistent cloaca], …”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the condition of 9 years is only a precaution, while Shia Imams also allowed penetrating her vagina if she is even younger than 9 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read this news (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-childbride-idUSBRE98910N20130910/&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text__text__1FZLe text__dark-grey__3Ml43 text__regular__2N1Xr text__small__1kGq2 body__full_width__ekUdw body__small_body__2vQyf article-body__paragraph__2-BtD&quot; data-testid=&quot;paragraph-0&quot;&gt;SANAA (Reuters) - An eight-year-old Yemeni girl died of internal bleeding on her wedding night after marrying a man five times her age, a social activist and two local residents said, in a case that has caused an outcry in the media and revived debate about child brides. Arwa Othman, head of Yemen House of Folklore and a leading rights campaigner, said the girl, identified only as Rawan, was married to a 40-year-old man late last week in the town of Meedi in Hajjah province in northwestern Yemen. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId580394&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dangers for minor girls if they are used for sexual pleasures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly: The rate of death among “Teen Mothers” and their babies is the highest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole internet is full of this information (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rate of death of Teen Mothers is the highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the rate of death among their babies is also the highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And not only the death rate, but these children also suffer highly from other mental and physical handicaps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And birth becomes very often complicated and OPERATION has to be performed instead of natural birth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly: Psychiatrists are WISER than Allah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam sends a minor girl to an old man of the age of her father and grandfather so that that old man can take sexual pleasure from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Psychiatrists claim that separating a minor girl from her parents, and then sending her alone to an old man for being used as a sexual object, causes a huge psychological depression to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Allah claims that he is the All-Wisest, and he does not do any injustice to such a minor girl, and she is not depressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, who is truthful? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah or these Psychologists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId10537&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Does verse 4:6 prohibit marriage with minor girls?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an Ijma (إجماع i.e. CONSENSUS) of Muslim Ummah that marriage with a minor girl is allowed. But in the present century, few modern Muslim Preachers (and the Quranists, i.e. those who reject Hadith) have started denying it. They are trying to misuse verse 4:6 as an argument to deny marriage to minor girls in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=6&quot;&gt;4:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;وَٱبْتَلُوا۟&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And test the orphans until when they reached the age of marriage (Nikah), then if you perceive in them sound judgement then deliver to them their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Modern Muslim preachers claim that one gets sound judgement about his wealth when one is already an adult person. Thus, this means that Islam prescribed that one can marry only after becoming an adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the word &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Nikah&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah&quot;&gt;Nikah&lt;/a&gt; has a double meaning in the Arabic language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the Islamic Sharia, &quot;Nikah&quot; is a terminology, whose meaning in Islamic Sharia is “marriage”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the literal meaning of “Nikah” in the Arabic language is &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;Nikah (Sexual Consummation of Marriage)&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah_%28Sexual_Consummation_of_Marriage%29&quot;&gt;To do Sexual Intercourse&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes even more evident from another verse of Quran 17:34:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.34?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 17:34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ &lt;b&gt;أَشُدَّهُۥ&lt;/b&gt; ۚ&lt;br&gt;Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of &lt;b&gt;full strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word أَشُدَّهُ (full strength) in this verse means the age when young boys and girls start feeling the desire/strength to do sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as Shar'i Nikah (marriage) is concerned, then there is no condition present in it of reaching the أَشُدَّهُ (i.e. Full Strength to do the act of intercourse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the proof is that prophet Muhammad himself did the Shar'i Nikah with 'Aisha, when she was only 6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And no one tests a 6 years old child for handing over his/her property to him/her, as a 6-year-old child has neither أَشُدَّهُ (Strength/Desire) nor he/she has any kind of “sound judgement” to look after his/her property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Shar'i Nikah has nothing to do with the أَشُدَّهُ (strength), as Muhammad did this Shar'i Nikah with 6 years 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, even at the age of 9, when 'Aisha finally came to the house of Muhammad for the consummation of marriage, she was still not mentally sound enough to look after any property or business. It is evident from the following hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-6130/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 6130:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, according to Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a girl reaches puberty, then she herself gets the right to give her consent for the marriage or to deny the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if she is a minor or prepubescent girl, then her father/guardian could wed her to anyone, even without her consent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if she is prepubescent and also an orphan, then her guardian has the right to wed her with himself (even without her consent), in order to get her property and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5064/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5064:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated 'Urwa: that he asked `Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! &lt;b&gt;(This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr (bride-dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr&lt;/b&gt;, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) &lt;b&gt;to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage&lt;/b&gt;, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reasons that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no longer considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islamqa.com, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet, also refutes these modern Muslim preachers regarding verse 6:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse 4:6 explains that an orphan’s money is given to him/her after they reach puberty and attain sound judgement. What’s meant by sound judgment is sound management of money. This can only happen after puberty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Reaching Nikah” mentioned in the verse means reaching puberty which can be known through sings such as menstruation for females and the growth of pubic hair. The verse used the expression “reaching Nikah” to actually mean “reaching puberty” because in most cases, it’s adults who perform Nikah. But this doesn’t mean that it’s not possible for non-adults to perform Nikah, which is permissible as proven by the Quran, Sunnah and the consensus of scholars. Plus, the same Surah and the same context of verses proves it (the permissibility of child marriage). (The verse that speaks about giving an orphan his money when he/she reaches Nikah is verse no.6) Verse no.3 says: “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. ”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse proves it’s allowed to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of Allah's Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning women..' (4.127) “&lt;a class=&quot;external free&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This shows it’s allowed to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId186814&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_Arabic_word_.E2.80.9CNisaa.27.E2.80.9D_does_not_refer_to_young_females&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Muslim Preachers also claim that the Arabic word “Nisaa'” cannot refer to minor girls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Muslim preachers also come up with this excuse that the word &lt;i&gt;Nisaa'&lt;/i&gt;  refers only to mature, adult women, therefore 65:4 cannot be talking about pre-pubescent females.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-13&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Child_Marriage_in_the_Qur%27an#cite_note-13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This linguistic argument does not hold water, even just on the basis of the Qur'an itself as a text. The word merely means “women/females” and can refer to mixed groups of women of various ages, as the English &quot;female&quot; or &quot;women.&quot; Here are some verses that use the word &lt;i&gt;&quot;nisaa'&quot;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.49?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 2:49&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ ۚ وَفِى ذَٰلِكُم بَلَآءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your (newborn) sons and let your women-folk (i.e. newborn girls) live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 7:127&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ أَتَذَرُ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُۥ لِيُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَءَالِهَتَكَ ۚ قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْىِۦ نِسَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَٰهِرُونَ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Said the chiefs of Pharaoh’s people: “Wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods?” He said: “Their (newborn) male children will we slay; (only) their (newborn) females will we save alive; and we have over them (power) irresistible.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above verses, the word &lt;i&gt;&quot;Nisaa'&quot;&lt;/i&gt; is referring to female infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Quran used the expression “Nisaa’ orphans” to mean “female orphans”. Orphans cannot be adults which means non-adults can be included in the word Nisaa’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;‏ويستفتونك في النساء قل الله يفتيكم فيهن ومايتلى عليكم في الكتاب في يتامى النساء اللاتي لاتؤتونهن ماكتب لهن وترغبون ان تنكحوهن والمستضعفين من الولدان وان تقوموا لليتامى بالقسط وماتفعلوا من خير فان الله كان به عليماThey consult thee concerning women. Say: Allah giveth you decree concerning them, and the Scripture which hath been recited unto you (giveth decree), concerning female orphans and those unto whom ye give not that which is ordained for them though ye desire to marry them, and (concerning) the weak among children, and that ye should deal justly with orphans. Whatever good ye do, lo! Allah is ever Aware of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic Excuse: Shariah didn't stipulate any age for Nikah, so it is a matter of Ijtehaad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Islamic apologist website wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/476539/ruling-on-giving-in-marriage-a-young-girl&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic principle is that there is nothing in Shari‘ah that stipulates a particular age of marriage for the man or the woman. The issue in question, which is related to specifying a particular age for marriage, falls under a general matter, which is: Does the guardian have the right to restrict what is permissible for the public interest? This is one of the matters of ijtihad, so no one should disapprove of it for what his ijtihad has led him to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy on the marriage of young girls reads: &quot;The age of marriage for young girls is determined with the permission of the judge and the matter is left (entrusted) to the ruler in each country according to the circumstances of time, place, and age, in a way that achieves the interest of all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is against Islamic rule that the Halal of Allah cannot be made Haram by any man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Muhammad was not allowed to make Halal of Allah haram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed Muhammad didn't make it to Haram in the incident where a foster father married his adopted daughter for her beauty and wealth. At maximum, Muhammad asked such men in the Quran to do justice and pay full Haq Mahr to their adopted minor daughters, but nothing was made illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why Sahaba were raping minor captive and minor slave girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Islamic history of 14 centuries, no one stipulated sex with minor girls to be Haram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId959348&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Either the Quran supports marriage with minor girls or it's linguistically imperfect and flawed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Just think about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;How can billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years make a mistake about this verse?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Billions of Muslims believe in this Quran from their hearts. They read this Quran and pondered upon it day and night, but still, the modern Islam apologists blame they got misguided despite reading this Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Didn't the Quran claim that its verses are CLEAR and EASY to understand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;But if the modern Quranists/Islamic Apologists claim that the billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years got misguided despite pondering upon it day and night, then it means that Quran is telling a lie that its verses are clear and EASY to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;How can then we believe in such a book which tells lies and make false claims?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at the Quran, which claims that its verses are Clear and Easy to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;easy to understand&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.17&quot;&gt;54:17&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;manifest&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2&quot;&gt;27:1-2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/12.2&quot;&gt;12:2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However according to modern Muslim apologists and the Quranists, then this Quran was neither a guide nor mercy for billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years, as minor girls were being wed and being used for sexual pleasures. And millions of minor slave girls were also bought from the slave markets, and used for sexual pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is then responsible for the plight of these minor girls?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Were really Muslims of the last 1400 years responsible, who were reading this Quran and pondering upon it, and despite that came to absolutely wrong and horrible conclusions? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Or it was the so-called Allah, who was UNABLE to reveal a single clear verse about the rights of minor girls? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Muslim preachers present the following arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If cultural evolution is indeed a fact, then why has patriarchy been prevalent throughout human history across the globe? Why did all societies arrive at the same solution and adopt the same patriarchal model? If patriarchy is inherently wrong, how did it manage to dominate the entire history of all cultures until merely 200 years ago?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, the divorce rate has only increased since the secular Western world rejected patriarchy and granted equal rights to women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rELyvRDRi7E&amp;amp;t=1951s&quot;&gt;Watch this debate&lt;/a&gt; featuring an Islamic preacher named Daniel Haqiqatjou, who presents similar arguments in support of patriarchy and explains why Islam does not provide equal rights to women, placing them beneath men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defending Patriarchy in Islam in the name of patriarchy cultures of the past:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a valid argument to defend Islamic patriarchy by citing other patriarchal cultures of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's wrong with the idea that humans have only become more civilized in the last 200 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All forms of evolution, including cultural evolution, take a long time. Modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago, but remained in the Stone Age for the next 290,000 years. It wasn't until 10,000 years ago that humans began to develop beyond that stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we evolved as animals. And the law of animals was also true for us, i.e. “&lt;strong&gt;Might is Right&lt;/strong&gt;”. Under the law of might is right, we were attacking other human groups, and we were killing them in order to take their women and children and property. Patriarchy is also the gift of that same might is right law. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This same might is right law also gave birth to the system of SLAVERY. Slavery was a worse form of patriarchy, but still it existed till 100 years ago. But then only under the pressure of the non-religious Secular West, it was the first time that Islamic countries had to agree to abolish the slavery system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we ask again what is wrong if we only recently became more civilized, and we started giving women EQUAL rights only 200 years ago? And LGBT community is still finding it difficult to get their rights even today, but the struggle will go on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of this, it's essential to recognize that advocating for the abolition of oppressive patriarchal structures is not a criminal act. On the contrary, it's a necessary step towards creating a fairer society where everyone can flourish. Those who resist this change and insist on maintaining an unjust status quo are the ones responsible for perpetuating harmful attitudes towards women and marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Divorce Rate Argument for keeping the patriarchy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Muslim leaders argue that granting women equal rights leads to increased divorce rates in Western societies. However, we must point out that maintaining a low divorce rate by oppressing and mistreating women is not a positive achievement. A household where the wife is subjected to domestic violence and abuse will only breed misery for all its members, including the woman herself and any children involved. It's a toxic environment that Muslim preachers refuse to acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when women receive an education, they become empowered and recognize their inherent human rights. Consequently, they reject exploitation and demand better treatment. This explains why divorce rates have risen in Arab Muslim nations, despite their deeply entrenched patriarchal systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Kuwait, the divorce rate stands at 60%. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200212124308/http://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/divorce-rate-kuwait-reaches-alarming-60-percent-year-interest-driven-marriages/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The divorce rate in Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and the UAE has surpassed 35%. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/jordan-ranks-3rd-divorce-rates-arab-world-%E2%80%94-report&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even in conservative Saudi Arabia, the divorce rate has hit 33%, with seven divorces occurring every hour. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/saudi-arabia-sees-7-divorce-cases-every-hour-1.85135151&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These figures demonstrate that the divorce rate among Arabic countries is actually higher than in some Western nations. While Islam and patriarchy remain unchanged in these countries, the key difference lies in the increasing education levels of Muslim women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve their cherished patriarchal system, Muslim apologists must keep women illiterate. Otherwise, educated women will continue to challenge and resist this oppressive regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only place where such a patriarchal system can thrive today is in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, which prohibits girls from attending universities or schools altogether. By keeping women ignorant, they aim to safeguard their patriarchal ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If Muslim men want to make the rate of divorce ZERO, then they should bear children only from Slave women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these Muslim preachers wish to reduce the divorce rate to zero, they should consider bearing children only with enslaved women. Instead of marriage, they should take &quot;slave women&quot; into their households and produce offspring solely from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest assured that Islam afforded no human rights to enslaved women. While a free Muslim wife may still have some chance of obtaining a divorce from an abusive spouse, enslaved women will remain trapped in your patriarchal system with no hope of escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cannot acquire enslaved women from outside sources, simply strip your free Muslim wives of their remaining rights and reduce them to slavery. This will stabilize your family system and ensure its continuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slaves and Labourer's Exploitation: A Gift of the Same Patriarchal Mentality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same patriarchal mindset that perpetuated slavery is still prevalent today, with its roots in the belief that &quot;might is right&quot; and the desire to exploit the weaker segments of society. The United States saw slave owners use the flimsy excuse that granting freedom to slaves would ruin their economy, as they relied on free labour to maintain their gardens (economic system). This argument was used to justify their opposition to abolishing slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, supporters of patriarchy refuse to grant women their rights, using the feeble excuse that it would disrupt their so-called family system, which is built upon the exploitation of vulnerable women. Similarly, many countries deny labourers their rights by claiming that providing them with fair treatment and compensation would damage their economy. Just look at Qatar's mistreatment of labourers leading up to the football World Cup. These countries seek to profit from the exploitation of workers, forcing them to work seven days a week and subjecting them to long-term abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this mindset of prioritizing profits over people, the modern, non-religious Western world has abolished slavery. During the Industrial Revolution, when labourers were in high demand, the West could have continued to rely on forced labour. However, instead, they chose to grant full human rights to imported labourers and treated them with dignity and respect. Compare this to the rich and wealthy Arab states, where labourers are still exploited, and the contrast is striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here is clear: defending patriarchy with weak excuses is unnecessary, but recognizing and upholding basic human rights is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson: Even if you have to sacrifice some of your financial or other benefits, do so for the sake of upholding the Basic Human Rights of those who are weaker or marginalized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear fellow humans,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that nature is not 100% perfect, and neither are our societies. We must acknowledge the existence of exploitation and oppression, particularly against marginalized communities. It is our responsibility to stand up against these injustices, even if it means sacrificing some of our financial gains or personal interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must recognize the value of basic human rights and dignity, and work towards creating a world where everyone is treated equally and with compassion. This includes standing up against systems of oppression, such as patriarchy, that perpetuate inequality and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to understand that the exploitation of weaker individuals is not only morally wrong, but it also goes against the principles of equality and justice. As humans, we have a duty to protect and promote the well-being of all members of our society, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or social status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is important to recognize that the consequences of exploitation and oppression can have far-reaching effects, impacting not only the present generation but also future generations. If we continue to support patriarchy and other forms of oppression, we risk creating a world where our own children and grandchildren will suffer the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we implore you to join us in this fight against injustice and oppression. Let us work together to create a world where every individual is treated with dignity and respect, and where basic human rights are protected and promoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the time to act is now. We cannot afford to wait any longer. Together, we can create a brighter future for ourselves and for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we ask again what is wrong if we only recently became more civilized, and we started giving women EQUAL rights only 200 years ago? And LGBT community is still finding it difficult to get their rights even today, but the struggle will go on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of this, it's essential to recognize that advocating for the abolition of oppressive patriarchal structures is not a criminal act. On the contrary, it's a necessary step towards creating a fairer society where everyone can flourish. Those who resist this change and insist on maintaining an unjust status quo are the ones responsible for perpetuating harmful attitudes towards women and marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Divorce Rate Argument for keeping the patriarchy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Muslim leaders argue that granting women equal rights leads to increased divorce rates in Western societies. However, we must point out that maintaining a low divorce rate by oppressing and mistreating women is not a positive achievement. A household where the wife is subjected to domestic violence and abuse will only breed misery for all its members, including the woman herself and any children involved. It's a toxic environment that Muslim preachers refuse to acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when women receive an education, they become empowered and recognize their inherent human rights. Consequently, they reject exploitation and demand better treatment. This explains why divorce rates have risen in Arab Muslim nations, despite their deeply entrenched patriarchal systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Kuwait, the divorce rate stands at 60%. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200212124308/http://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/divorce-rate-kuwait-reaches-alarming-60-percent-year-interest-driven-marriages/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The divorce rate in Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and the UAE has surpassed 35%. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/jordan-ranks-3rd-divorce-rates-arab-world-%E2%80%94-report&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even in conservative Saudi Arabia, the divorce rate has hit 33%, with seven divorces occurring every hour. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/saudi-arabia-sees-7-divorce-cases-every-hour-1.85135151&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These figures demonstrate that the divorce rate among Arabic countries is actually higher than in some Western nations. While Islam and patriarchy remain unchanged in these countries, the key difference lies in the increasing education levels of Muslim women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve their cherished patriarchal system, Muslim apologists must keep women illiterate. Otherwise, educated women will continue to challenge and resist this oppressive regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only place where such a patriarchal system can thrive today is in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, which prohibits girls from attending universities or schools altogether. By keeping women ignorant, they aim to safeguard their patriarchal ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If Muslim men want to make the rate of divorce ZERO, then they should bear children only from Slave women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these Muslim preachers wish to reduce the divorce rate to zero, they should consider bearing children only with enslaved women. Instead of marriage, they should take &quot;slave women&quot; into their households and produce offspring solely from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest assured that Islam afforded no human rights to enslaved women. While a free Muslim wife may still have some chance of obtaining a divorce from an abusive spouse, enslaved women will remain trapped in your patriarchal system with no hope of escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cannot acquire enslaved women from outside sources, simply strip your free Muslim wives of their remaining rights and reduce them to slavery. This will stabilize your family system and ensure its continuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slaves and Labourer's Exploitation: A Gift of the Same Patriarchal Mentality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same patriarchal mindset that perpetuated slavery is still prevalent today, with its roots in the belief that &quot;might is right&quot; and the desire to exploit the weaker segments of society. The United States saw slave owners use the flimsy excuse that granting freedom to slaves would ruin their economy, as they relied on free labour to maintain their gardens (economic system). This argument was used to justify their opposition to abolishing slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, supporters of patriarchy refuse to grant women their rights, using the feeble excuse that it would disrupt their so-called family system, which is built upon the exploitation of vulnerable women. Similarly, many countries deny labourers their rights by claiming that providing them with fair treatment and compensation would damage their economy. Just look at Qatar's mistreatment of labourers leading up to the football World Cup. These countries seek to profit from the exploitation of workers, forcing them to work seven days a week and subjecting them to long-term abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this mindset of prioritizing profits over people, the modern, non-religious Western world has abolished slavery. During the Industrial Revolution, when labourers were in high demand, the West could have continued to rely on forced labour. However, instead, they chose to grant full human rights to imported labourers and treated them with dignity and respect. Compare this to the rich and wealthy Arab states, where labourers are still exploited, and the contrast is striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here is clear: defending patriarchy with weak excuses is unnecessary, but recognizing and upholding basic human rights is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson: Even if you have to sacrifice some of your financial or other benefits, do so for the sake of upholding the Basic Human Rights of those who are weaker or marginalized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear fellow humans,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that nature is not 100% perfect, and neither are our societies. We must acknowledge the existence of exploitation and oppression, particularly against marginalized communities. It is our responsibility to stand up against these injustices, even if it means sacrificing some of our financial gains or personal interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must recognize the value of basic human rights and dignity, and work towards creating a world where everyone is treated equally and with compassion. This includes standing up against systems of oppression, such as patriarchy, that perpetuate inequality and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to understand that the exploitation of weaker individuals is not only morally wrong, but it also goes against the principles of equality and justice. As humans, we have a duty to protect and promote the well-being of all members of our society, regardless of their gender, race, religion, or social status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is important to recognize that the consequences of exploitation and oppression can have far-reaching effects, impacting not only the present generation but also future generations. If we continue to support patriarchy and other forms of oppression, we risk creating a world where our own children and grandchildren will suffer the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we implore you to join us in this fight against injustice and oppression. Let us work together to create a world where every individual is treated with dignity and respect, and where basic human rights are protected and promoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the time to act is now. We cannot afford to wait any longer. Together, we can create a brighter future for ourselves and for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Liberal secular French laws literally mandate that men be reduced to cuckolds. Not only are women legally entitled to cheat on their husbands, but the law bans paternity tests - such that men are obligated to raise and pay child support for the offspring of their wives' lovers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/u0nyCuSu6V&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/u0nyCuSu6V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Daniel Haqiqatjou (@Haqiqatjou) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Haqiqatjou/status/1643753186950520832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 5, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it's important to note that not every country in the Western world agrees with French law regarding paternity tests. Many Western nations openly disagree with it, believing that fathers have a right to know the truth and achieve peace of mind. As a result, several Western countries do allow paternity tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also crucial to recognize that the primary target of criticism of Islamic preachers is not French law (which is a secondary issue), but their primary focus of criticism is on the underlying principles and mechanisms of the whole Western system itself. Therefore, French law may be right or wrong, but we must emphasize that the broader Western legal framework remains sound. In fact, when comparing Western laws to Islamic laws, the former emerges victorious. We will deal with Islamic alternatives later in this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Analysis of French Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's examine the underlying reasoning behind French law. Despite criticism from some quarters of the Western world, it's essential to understand the rationale behind French legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents argue that French law prioritizes the best interests of the child. According to them, the individual who raises and nurtures a child holds a position of greater significance than the biological mother or father. A child's attachment figure is not necessarily determined by biology; instead, it is the person who provides love, care, and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French government did not arrive at this decision independently. Psychologists advise that societal norms, rather than biology alone, define fatherhood. By acknowledging this perspective, family harmony remains intact. In cases where couples divorce, the father's relationship with the child endures, and parental rights remain unaffected. Unfortunately, Islamic preachers often focus solely on financial support while disregarding the importance of parental rights and the child's well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some Western critics contend that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fathers deserve assurance regarding their biological connection to their children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intentionally deceiving spouses undermine fairness toward fathers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to acknowledge that French law strives to promote stability and the child's best interests, even though there might be valid arguments against certain aspects of the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Does the Western System Operate and Why Is It Superior to Islamic Laws?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To comprehend the advantages of the Western system, it's essential to grasp its fundamental principles and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Western societies, laws and regulations are created through a process of discussion, debate, and consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the core of the Western system lies the understanding that imperfections exist in life, and thus, finding ideal solutions may prove challenging. Instead, decisions are made after careful consideration and deliberation, aiming to achieve the most optimal outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, this doesn't imply infallibility. Mistakes can occur due to human limitations. Consequently, the Western system embraces constructive criticism, welcoming opportunities to rectify errors, improve existing policies, and adapt to changing circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One prime example of this &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;self-improvement mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the French law. Like any other aspect of the Western system, it is designed to evolve and respond to new information, critiques, and emerging needs. Its flexibility allows for modifications and enhancements, enabling the legal framework to stay relevant and effective in addressing contemporary challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the strength of the Western system resides in its capacity to learn from past mistakes, engage in meaningful discourse, and continually refine its institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000eff;&quot;&gt;Compared to this, Islamic laws are absolutely not open to any criticism, but any criticism is immediately called blasphemy, and people are put to death. Islamic laws cannot be changed till the last hour. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Inuit Culture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Inuit community, also known as Eskimo, there was a longstanding tradition of mutual support and equality. When a man had to leave his home for an extended period, whether for hunting or other necessities, his neighbor or friend would take care of his family, including his wife. Any child born from this arrangement was considered an integral part of the household, just like any other child. This custom was practiced for centuries, and these children were never referred to as bastards or subjected to any form of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Eskimo men may sleep with their friends’ wives as a tradition, it is possible that women here would become pregnant with a child that isn’t her husband’s. But it’s totally normal. In fact, wives and kids are considered communal in Eskimo society. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, no matter whose child a woman is bearing, her family will love and raise the kid as their own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://starbiz.com/trending-worldwide/eskimo-wife-swapping-15732&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can gain valuable insight into the protection afforded to children in the Inuit culture, which provides a stark contrast to the negative treatment of children born out of wedlock in certain religious traditions. Unlike the latter, the former approach emphasizes community responsibility and acceptance, rather than stigmatization and blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that Western critics of French law distinguish between the cultural practices of the Inuit and those of France. While the Inuit culture prioritizes consent and cooperation among all parties involved, French law has been criticized for condoning deception and betrayal of spouses. As such, these two approaches cannot be equated or compared directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islam OFFICIALLY turned women into &quot;Cuckquean&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term cuckold is the favourite term of Islamic preachers. But have you ever heard the term Cuckquean from their mouths? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please think about it. It is unfortunate, but Islam turned women into &quot;Cuckqueans&quot; by indoctrinating them and the whole society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A man can sleep with 4 wives, and the wives are legally bound to keep on acting as Cuckquaen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a man can also rape DOZENS of captive/slave women and girls, and all of them are legally bound to keep on acting as Cuckquaens. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the sexual relationship with captive/slave women is a TEMPORARY one (i.e. like Shia Muttah). An owner can buy a slave girl, rape her, and after fulfilling his lust, he can sell her further and buy for himself a new slave girl. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;And Islam didn't even allow the poor wives and slave girls to get rid of their unfaithful and rapist husbands/masters by taking DIVORCE. In Islam, divorce is solely a right of the husband. Even Khul' خلع is also a right of the husband. In Khul', a wife has to offer ransom money to her husband. If he accepts the offer, then he can take the money and divorce her. But if he does not accept the offer, then no Islamic court can compel him to give divorce to his wife. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=33&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;Khul’ خلع (i.e. getting freedom from husband) is not a “right” of a woman, but it is still a “right” of a husband to either grant it or deny it &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islamic Solution: What if a husband doubts the paternity of the child?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Islam, a man is allowed to accuse his wife of adultery and label her child as illegitimate, even without concrete evidence. All he needs to do is swear five times, and he will be able to divorce his wife and abandon the child, without providing any financial support. This practice is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=22&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;Liaan&lt;/a&gt; in Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question that arises is, what protections does Allah provide to the woman and her child when a man falsely accuses her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Allah provides zero protection to the innocent woman and her child in such cases. False accusations can stem from mere suspicion, misunderstandings, or even malicious intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does Islam allow men to accuse their wives and disown their children, but it also labels the child as a bastard (Walad al-Haram in Islamic terms). The child is considered illegitimate regardless of whether the mother was actually unfaithful or not. Moreover, the father doesn't have to contribute financially to the child's upbringing; instead, the mother must bear all the expenses alone, even if she was innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the mother happened to commit adultery and had a child out of wedlock, Islam prohibits the biological father from giving his name to the child, showing affection, or contributing financially. However, why should the innocent child suffer and be denied the love and recognition of their biological father? Islam forces the child to carry the stigma of being a bastard by taking only their mother's name, making them vulnerable to social humiliation. It's truly unjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that these Sharia rulings of Islam regarding innocent children are completely against logic, which is impossible if they were truly divinely inspired. This human error in the Sharia ruling proves only one thing: Muhammad created these revelations and rulings himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's examine how Islam first declares an innocent child to be a bastard and then humiliates them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3963&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 3963:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated AbuHurayrah: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The child of adultery is worst of the three (i.e. father, mother and child). &lt;br&gt;Abu Hurairah said: That I give a flog in the path of Allah (as a charity) is dearer to me than emancipating a child of adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Al-Albani)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the crime of an innocent child that Islam treats them in such a horrible way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the full list of the suffering of such innocent children (whom Islam calls Walad ul-Haram), read this article: Illegitimate Children: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=102&amp;amp;catid=35&quot;&gt;Illegitimate Children: What is the WISDOM of Allah in calling them BASTARDS (Walad al-Haram)&lt;/a&gt;? It's an eye-opening issue, so don't miss it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the modern secular world has ended this terrible practice of branding innocent children as bastards. They are no longer discriminated against or humiliated because of their parents' actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islamic Solution: What if an Owner (i.e. Muslim Master) doubts the paternity of the child from her slave woman? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Muslim owner was allowed to rape a slave woman in a Temporary sexual relationship and then sold her to another master, who again raped her and then sold her to a 3rd master. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, problems arose what to do if doubts occurred about the parentage of the child in such cases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohammad came up with this solution, that the owner was allowed to deny the parentage of his own child from a slave woman, and thus declare his own child to be a BASTARD (Arabic: Walad-ul-Haram).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the 2 joint owners didn't want the parentage of the child from their common slave women, they were also allowed to deny the parentage and declare the child a Bastard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Sunnan Ibn Majah (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180820094325/http://www.hadithurdu.com/06/6-2-905/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;وَلَا يَلْحَقُ إِذَا کَانَ أَبُوهُ الَّذِي يُدْعَی لَهُ أَنْکَرَهُ&lt;br&gt;… a child from a slave woman cannot be named after his father if the man whom he claimed as his father did not acknowledge him.&lt;br&gt;Imam Albani declared this Hadith as Fair (Hasan). &lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/a6817490272ab84d27fbb906c32ceb1a&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;This same tradition has also been narrated by Amr bin Shoaib in Sunnan Abdu Dawud, and has again been graded as Hasan (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/83608&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Muhammad bin Ahmad Sarkhasi (d. 483 H) writes in his book Al-Mabsut, Volume 2 page 152 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ar.wikisource.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B7_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%AE%D8%B3%D9%8A_-_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9_%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B12&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;وولد أم الولد ثابت من المولى ما لم ينفه لأنها فراش له وقال عليه الصلاة والسلام الولد للفراش ولكن ينتفي عنه بمجرد النفي عندنا&lt;br&gt;“The son of a slave woman is attributed to the owner as long as he didn’t deny it, because she had been on a bed with him, He (i.e. prophet Muhammad) said that the son belongs to the bed, but he (the child) will be not be attributed to him if he just denied him according to us.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;And Imam Ibn Hamam writes in his book Fath al-Qadir (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150909191637/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=23&amp;amp;ID=138&amp;amp;idfrom=2473&amp;amp;idto=2643&amp;amp;bookid=23&amp;amp;startno=68&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;أم الولد بسبب أن ولدها ، وإن ثبت نسبه بلا دعوة ينتفي نسبه بمجرد نفيه ، بخلاف المنكوحة لا ينتفي نسب ولدها إلا باللعان&lt;br&gt;“The slave woman’s son, even if his paternity is proven without a claim (from the father), has his parentage disassociated just by denial, unlike the wife in a Nikah whose son’s parentage cannot be dissociated except through “le’an.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Showkani records in Nail al-Awtar, Volume 7 page 77 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150909192040/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=47&amp;amp;ID=&amp;amp;idfrom=2135&amp;amp;idto=2162&amp;amp;bookid=47&amp;amp;startno=9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;وروي عن أبي حنيفة والثوري وهو مذهب الهادوية أن الأمة لا يثبت فراشها إلا بدعوة الولد ولا يكفي الإقرار بالوطئ ، فإن لم يدعه كان ملكا له&lt;br&gt;“It is narrated from Abi Hanifa, al-Thawri and it is the Hadwiyah madhab that the paternity of a slave woman’s (son) cannot be proved without the claim (from the father), the admission of performing sexual intercourse shall not suffice, if he didn’t claim paternity, he (the son) will become a slave for him. “&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the child is declared a BASTARD, then he/she becomes a slave of the father. And the father is fully allowed to sell his son/daughter in the salve market and get money for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can this horrible Islamic law (where a father is making his own son/daughter his slave) be still compared with French Law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Even if the wife is an eyewitness of ZINA (adultery) of her husband, she should still act as &lt;span style=&quot;color: #fe0000;&quot;&gt;Cuckquean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read our article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=22&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;Liaan اللعان: A Husband can accuse his wife of adultery without any 4 witnesses, but if a wife accuses her husband of adultery (or rape) and she does not produce 4 eye-witnesses, then she will be lashed 80 times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if wives have personally seen their husbands doing ZINA (fornication) with other women (or even if they have seen their husbands raping other women), still they are not allowed to accuse their husbands in any Islamic court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or even if they have seen their husbands having a sexual relationship with any other male, still neither can they go against their husbands in court, nor separate themselves from such husbands through a divorce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if the respective wives &lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;still dare to accuse their husbands of fornication/rape in an Islamic court, then they have to bring 4 male eyewitnesses for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if the wife is not able to bring 4 male witnesses to the court, then she will be lashed with 80 stripes for Qadhf i.e. wrongfully accusing her husband, even if she is telling the truth (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=122&amp;amp;catid=9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic Scholars advise such women to become &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cuckquean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, turn their eyes blind, and never go to Islamic courts against their husbands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2 to 5 Official Fathers of a child (due to her rape in the temporary sexual relationship)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were two or more joint owners of the slave women, then Islam allowed those joint owners to rape her one by one. They only had to wait for 3 (to 7) days, so that the slave woman became free of her menstruation blood, and after that next owner was allowed to start raping her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this caused doubts in many cases about who the real father of the child was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Muhammad adopted this solution where both those 2 (or more) joint owners became the Combined Official Fathers of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Qadamah wrote in his book Al-Mughani (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20221101084210/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=15&amp;amp;ID=5562&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وإذا كانت الأمة بين شريكين فوطئاها لزمها استبراءان&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a slave woman is in joint ownership of 2 men, then they both could have sex with her by performing double &quot;Istabra&quot; (i.e. becoming free of monthly blood twice)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is written in Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, vol. 6, page 162, Urdu edition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160630070915/https://s5.postimg.org/5kdg1tmef/slave_girl_2_fathers.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two men have joint ownership of a slave woman, and a child is born, and both claimed the parentage of the child, then both will be the (official) father of that child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this same Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, vol. 6, page 173, Urdu edition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160630072810/https://s5.postimg.org/d1mnh1bxj/slave_2_or_5_fathers.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), it has been written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abu Hanifa said: If a slave woman is in joint ownership of 3 or 4 or 5 men, and all of them claimed the parentage of the child, then all of them will be his (official) fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatawa-e-Alamgiri is an authentic Fiqh book of Hanafi jurisprudence and has been taught in all the Hanafi Madaris (religious schools) of the Indian Sub-Continent (i.e. Pakistan/India/Bangladesh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muhammad instructed his companion to keep on taking pleasure with his beautiful wife, even if she committed adultery with other men (i.e. he could act as a cuckold)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/4&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, 2049&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ), and said: My wife does not prevent the hand of a man who touches her (i.e. who fornicates with her). He said: Divorce her. He then said: I am afraid my inner self may covet her. He said: Then (keep) enjoying her (as your wife).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Al-Albani)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This is a huge contradiction here:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On one side Muhammad talked about modesty, decency, being chaste, Hijab, not even talking to the opposite gender, and awarding the CRUELLEST punishment of stoning for adultery. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But on the other hand, Muhammad is instructing his companion to keep on taking pleasure from his beautiful wife, even if she does adultery with other men (companions?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The French Law may be right or may be wrong. But one thing is sure it was also made by keeping the &lt;strong&gt;best interest&lt;/strong&gt; of the child in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if it is a mistake, we are still in a position to keep watching the results and to reform it in the future. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fe0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But can we say the same about this Islamic law that it is based upon the Best Interest of the child?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0015ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is calling an innocent child a BASTARD (Walad-ul-Haram) in the best interest of a child?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Liberal secular French laws literally mandate that men be reduced to cuckolds. Not only are women legally entitled to cheat on their husbands, but the law bans paternity tests - such that men are obligated to raise and pay child support for the offspring of their wives' lovers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/u0nyCuSu6V&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/u0nyCuSu6V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Daniel Haqiqatjou (@Haqiqatjou) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Haqiqatjou/status/1643753186950520832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 5, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it's important to note that not every country in the Western world agrees with French law regarding paternity tests. Many Western nations openly disagree with it, believing that fathers have a right to know the truth and achieve peace of mind. As a result, several Western countries do allow paternity tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also crucial to recognize that the primary target of criticism of Islamic preachers is not French law (which is a secondary issue), but their primary focus of criticism is on the underlying principles and mechanisms of the whole Western system itself. Therefore, French law may be right or wrong, but we must emphasize that the broader Western legal framework remains sound. In fact, when comparing Western laws to Islamic laws, the former emerges victorious. We will deal with Islamic alternatives later in this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Analysis of French Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's examine the underlying reasoning behind French law. Despite criticism from some quarters of the Western world, it's essential to understand the rationale behind French legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents argue that French law prioritizes the best interests of the child. According to them, the individual who raises and nurtures a child holds a position of greater significance than the biological mother or father. A child's attachment figure is not necessarily determined by biology; instead, it is the person who provides love, care, and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French government did not arrive at this decision independently. Psychologists advise that societal norms, rather than biology alone, define fatherhood. By acknowledging this perspective, family harmony remains intact. In cases where couples divorce, the father's relationship with the child endures, and parental rights remain unaffected. Unfortunately, Islamic preachers often focus solely on financial support while disregarding the importance of parental rights and the child's well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some Western critics contend that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fathers deserve assurance regarding their biological connection to their children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intentionally deceiving spouses undermine fairness toward fathers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to acknowledge that French law strives to promote stability and the child's best interests, even though there might be valid arguments against certain aspects of the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Does the Western System Operate and Why Is It Superior to Islamic Laws?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To comprehend the advantages of the Western system, it's essential to grasp its fundamental principles and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Western societies, laws and regulations are created through a process of discussion, debate, and consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the core of the Western system lies the understanding that imperfections exist in life, and thus, finding ideal solutions may prove challenging. Instead, decisions are made after careful consideration and deliberation, aiming to achieve the most optimal outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, this doesn't imply infallibility. Mistakes can occur due to human limitations. Consequently, the Western system embraces constructive criticism, welcoming opportunities to rectify errors, improve existing policies, and adapt to changing circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One prime example of this &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;self-improvement mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the French law. Like any other aspect of the Western system, it is designed to evolve and respond to new information, critiques, and emerging needs. Its flexibility allows for modifications and enhancements, enabling the legal framework to stay relevant and effective in addressing contemporary challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the strength of the Western system resides in its capacity to learn from past mistakes, engage in meaningful discourse, and continually refine its institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000eff;&quot;&gt;Compared to this, Islamic laws are absolutely not open to any criticism, but any criticism is immediately called blasphemy, and people are put to death. Islamic laws cannot be changed till the last hour. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Inuit Culture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Inuit community, also known as Eskimo, there was a longstanding tradition of mutual support and equality. When a man had to leave his home for an extended period, whether for hunting or other necessities, his neighbor or friend would take care of his family, including his wife. Any child born from this arrangement was considered an integral part of the household, just like any other child. This custom was practiced for centuries, and these children were never referred to as bastards or subjected to any form of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Eskimo men may sleep with their friends’ wives as a tradition, it is possible that women here would become pregnant with a child that isn’t her husband’s. But it’s totally normal. In fact, wives and kids are considered communal in Eskimo society. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, no matter whose child a woman is bearing, her family will love and raise the kid as their own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://starbiz.com/trending-worldwide/eskimo-wife-swapping-15732&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can gain valuable insight into the protection afforded to children in the Inuit culture, which provides a stark contrast to the negative treatment of children born out of wedlock in certain religious traditions. Unlike the latter, the former approach emphasizes community responsibility and acceptance, rather than stigmatization and blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that Western critics of French law distinguish between the cultural practices of the Inuit and those of France. While the Inuit culture prioritizes consent and cooperation among all parties involved, French law has been criticized for condoning deception and betrayal of spouses. As such, these two approaches cannot be equated or compared directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islam OFFICIALLY turned women into &quot;Cuckquean&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term cuckold is the favourite term of Islamic preachers. But have you ever heard the term Cuckquean from their mouths? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please think about it. It is unfortunate, but Islam turned women into &quot;Cuckqueans&quot; by indoctrinating them and the whole society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A man can sleep with 4 wives, and the wives are legally bound to keep on acting as Cuckquaen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a man can also rape DOZENS of captive/slave women and girls, and all of them are legally bound to keep on acting as Cuckquaens. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the sexual relationship with captive/slave women is a TEMPORARY one (i.e. like Shia Muttah). An owner can buy a slave girl, rape her, and after fulfilling his lust, he can sell her further and buy for himself a new slave girl. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;And Islam didn't even allow the poor wives and slave girls to get rid of their unfaithful and rapist husbands/masters by taking DIVORCE. In Islam, divorce is solely a right of the husband. Even Khul' خلع is also a right of the husband. In Khul', a wife has to offer ransom money to her husband. If he accepts the offer, then he can take the money and divorce her. But if he does not accept the offer, then no Islamic court can compel him to give divorce to his wife. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=33&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;Khul’ خلع (i.e. getting freedom from husband) is not a “right” of a woman, but it is still a “right” of a husband to either grant it or deny it &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islamic Solution: What if a husband doubts the paternity of the child?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Islam, a man is allowed to accuse his wife of adultery and label her child as illegitimate, even without concrete evidence. All he needs to do is swear five times, and he will be able to divorce his wife and abandon the child, without providing any financial support. This practice is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=22&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;Liaan&lt;/a&gt; in Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question that arises is, what protections does Allah provide to the woman and her child when a man falsely accuses her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Allah provides zero protection to the innocent woman and her child in such cases. False accusations can stem from mere suspicion, misunderstandings, or even malicious intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does Islam allow men to accuse their wives and disown their children, but it also labels the child as a bastard (Walad al-Haram in Islamic terms). The child is considered illegitimate regardless of whether the mother was actually unfaithful or not. Moreover, the father doesn't have to contribute financially to the child's upbringing; instead, the mother must bear all the expenses alone, even if she was innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the mother happened to commit adultery and had a child out of wedlock, Islam prohibits the biological father from giving his name to the child, showing affection, or contributing financially. However, why should the innocent child suffer and be denied the love and recognition of their biological father? Islam forces the child to carry the stigma of being a bastard by taking only their mother's name, making them vulnerable to social humiliation. It's truly unjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that these Sharia rulings of Islam regarding innocent children are completely against logic, which is impossible if they were truly divinely inspired. This human error in the Sharia ruling proves only one thing: Muhammad created these revelations and rulings himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's examine how Islam first declares an innocent child to be a bastard and then humiliates them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3963&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 3963:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated AbuHurayrah: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The child of adultery is worst of the three (i.e. father, mother and child). &lt;br&gt;Abu Hurairah said: That I give a flog in the path of Allah (as a charity) is dearer to me than emancipating a child of adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Al-Albani)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the crime of an innocent child that Islam treats them in such a horrible way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the full list of the suffering of such innocent children (whom Islam calls Walad ul-Haram), read this article: Illegitimate Children: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=102&amp;amp;catid=35&quot;&gt;Illegitimate Children: What is the WISDOM of Allah in calling them BASTARDS (Walad al-Haram)&lt;/a&gt;? It's an eye-opening issue, so don't miss it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the modern secular world has ended this terrible practice of branding innocent children as bastards. They are no longer discriminated against or humiliated because of their parents' actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islamic Solution: What if an Owner (i.e. Muslim Master) doubts the paternity of the child from her slave woman? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Muslim owner was allowed to rape a slave woman in a Temporary sexual relationship and then sold her to another master, who again raped her and then sold her to a 3rd master. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, problems arose what to do if doubts occurred about the parentage of the child in such cases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohammad came up with this solution, that the owner was allowed to deny the parentage of his own child from a slave woman, and thus declare his own child to be a BASTARD (Arabic: Walad-ul-Haram).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the 2 joint owners didn't want the parentage of the child from their common slave women, they were also allowed to deny the parentage and declare the child a Bastard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Sunnan Ibn Majah (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180820094325/http://www.hadithurdu.com/06/6-2-905/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Muhammad bin Ahmad Sarkhasi (d. 483 H) writes in his book Al-Mabsut, Volume 2 page 152 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ar.wikisource.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B7_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%AE%D8%B3%D9%8A_-_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9_%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B12&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;And Imam Ibn Hamam writes in his book Fath al-Qadir (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150909191637/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=23&amp;amp;ID=138&amp;amp;idfrom=2473&amp;amp;idto=2643&amp;amp;bookid=23&amp;amp;startno=68&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Showkani records in Nail al-Awtar, Volume 7 page 77 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150909192040/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=47&amp;amp;ID=&amp;amp;idfrom=2135&amp;amp;idto=2162&amp;amp;bookid=47&amp;amp;startno=9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;وروي عن أبي حنيفة والثوري وهو مذهب الهادوية أن الأمة لا يثبت فراشها إلا بدعوة الولد ولا يكفي الإقرار بالوطئ ، فإن لم يدعه كان ملكا له&lt;br&gt;“It is narrated from Abi Hanifa, al-Thawri and it is the Hadwiyah madhab that the paternity of a slave woman’s (son) cannot be proved without the claim (from the father), the admission of performing sexual intercourse shall not suffice, if he didn’t claim paternity, he (the son) will become a slave for him. “&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the child is declared a BASTARD, then he/she becomes a slave of the father. And the father is fully allowed to sell his son/daughter in the salve market and get money for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can this horrible Islamic law (where a father is making his own son/daughter his slave) be still compared with French Law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Even if the wife is an eyewitness of ZINA (adultery) of her husband, she should still act as &lt;span style=&quot;color: #fe0000;&quot;&gt;Cuckquean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read our article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if wives have personally seen their husbands doing ZINA (fornication) with other women (or even if they have seen their husbands raping other women), still they are not allowed to accuse their husbands in any Islamic court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or even if they have seen their husbands having a sexual relationship with any other male, still neither can they go against their husbands in court, nor separate themselves from such husbands through a divorce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if the respective wives &lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;still dare to accuse their husbands of fornication/rape in an Islamic court, then they have to bring 4 male eyewitnesses for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if the wife is not able to bring 4 male witnesses to the court, then she will be lashed with 80 stripes for Qadhf i.e. wrongfully accusing her husband, even if she is telling the truth (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=122&amp;amp;catid=9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic Scholars advise such women to become &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cuckquean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, turn their eyes blind, and never go to Islamic courts against their husbands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2 to 5 Official Fathers of a child (due to her rape in the temporary sexual relationship)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were two or more joint owners of the slave women, then Islam allowed those joint owners to rape her one by one. They only had to wait for 3 (to 7) days, so that the slave woman became free of her menstruation blood, and after that next owner was allowed to start raping her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this caused doubts in many cases about who the real father of the child was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Muhammad adopted this solution where both those 2 (or more) joint owners became the Combined Official Fathers of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Qadamah wrote in his book Al-Mughani (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20221101084210/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=15&amp;amp;ID=5562&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وإذا كانت الأمة بين شريكين فوطئاها لزمها استبراءان&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a slave woman is in joint ownership of 2 men, then they both could have sex with her by performing double &quot;Istabra&quot; (i.e. becoming free of monthly blood twice)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is written in Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, vol. 6, page 162, Urdu edition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160630070915/https://s5.postimg.org/5kdg1tmef/slave_girl_2_fathers.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two men have joint ownership of a slave woman, and a child is born, and both claimed the parentage of the child, then both will be the (official) father of that child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this same Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, vol. 6, page 173, Urdu edition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160630072810/https://s5.postimg.org/d1mnh1bxj/slave_2_or_5_fathers.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), it has been written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abu Hanifa said: If a slave woman is in joint ownership of 3 or 4 or 5 men, and all of them claimed the parentage of the child, then all of them will be his (official) fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatawa-e-Alamgiri is an authentic Fiqh book of Hanafi jurisprudence and has been taught in all the Hanafi Madaris (religious schools) of the Indian Sub-Continent (i.e. Pakistan/India/Bangladesh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muhammad instructed his companion to keep on taking pleasure with his beautiful wife, even if she committed adultery with other men (i.e. he could act as a cuckold)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/4&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, 2049&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ), and said: My wife does not prevent the hand of a man who touches her (i.e. who fornicates with her). He said: Divorce her. He then said: I am afraid my inner self may covet her. He said: Then (keep) enjoying her (as your wife).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Al-Albani)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This is a huge contradiction here:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On one side Muhammad talked about modesty, decency, being chaste, Hijab, not even talking to the opposite gender, and awarding the CRUELLEST punishment of stoning for adultery. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But on the other hand, Muhammad is instructing his companion to keep on taking pleasure from his beautiful wife, even if she does adultery with other men (companions?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the full article &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=158&amp;amp;catid=14&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which provides more information regarding this contradiction in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;French law vs. Islamic law:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The French Law may be right or may be wrong. But one thing is sure it was also made by keeping the &lt;strong&gt;best interest&lt;/strong&gt; of the child in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if it is a mistake, we are still in a position to keep watching the results and to reform it in the future. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fe0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But can we say the same about this Islamic law that it is based upon the Best Interest of the child?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0015ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is calling an innocent child a BASTARD (Walad-ul-Haram) in the best interest of a child?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fe0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is depriving an innocent child of the support, love, and upbringing of any father in the best interest of a child?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<h2>Summary:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad adopted the practice of 'Iddah from the pre-Islamic era.</li>
<li>He imposed unnecessary restrictions on women, unrelated to determining the parentage of the child.</li>
<li>Muhammad made scientific errors while enforcing 'Iddah rulings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Muslims argue that Allah granted women their rights with <strong>justice</strong>, while the secular Western world made a mistake by providing women with "<strong>equal</strong>" rights to men, oppressing them in the process. Let's examine the validity of this claim and assess whether Islam truly upholds <strong>justice</strong> for women.</p>

<h3>Different lengths for Waiting Periods for different women:</h3>
<p>Varied waiting periods for different women in Islam are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. A slave (or a captive of war) woman: </strong></p>
<p>The waiting period is becoming free of the first menstrual blood (i.e. 3 to 7 days in which she becomes free of her menstrual blood). After that, the new Muslim master can rape her. </p>
<p><strong>2. A widow woman: </strong></p>
<p>The waiting period is 4 months and 10 days.</p>
<p><strong>3. A pregnant woman: </strong></p>
<p>The waiting period is up to 9 months, lasting until the birth of the baby.</p>
<p><strong>4. A divorced woman: </strong></p>
<p>The waiting period is 3 menstrual cycles. During these cycles, she receives no attention, love, or emotional support from any man. The first 3 menstrual cycles constitute the divorce process, during which her husband does not have physical contact with her, while he remains permitted to engage with other wives and slave girls. After the divorce, she is subjected to another 3 menstrual cycles of waiting, amounting to, in total, about 6 months of practically solitary confinement.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ila <a href="https://islamqa.org/hanafi/askimam/126436/question-in-regards-to-ila/">(الإيلاء)</a></strong>:</p>
<p>This is another form of divorce in Islam. In this case, a man refrains from physical contact with his wife for 4 months, following which the divorce takes place. Nevertheless, the wife must still observe the waiting period of 3 menstrual cycles, resulting in about 7 months of practically solitary confinement-like situation.</p>
<p>These waiting periods differ for each category of women, and the length of time they have to wait and stay without the companionship of men varies accordingly.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId82861"></a>Muhammad copied this illogical practice of ‘Iddah from the pre-Islamic period of so-called Ignorance</h3>
<p>Muhammad copied this ‘Iddah from the culture of people of the Pre-Islamic period of ignorance.</p>
<p>Just check this logic of Muhammad for putting all these oppressive restrictions upon the woman in the name of ‘Iddah, where he told them not to make complaints against the Islamic Iddah, while they had to stay even for longer periods of time in ‘Iddah during the pre-Islamic days. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5336">Sahih Bukhari, Book of Divorce</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Um Salama said that a woman came to Allah's Messenger and said, "O Allah's Messenger ! The husband of my daughter has died and she is suffering from an eye disease. Can she apply collyrium/kohl to her eye?" Allah's Messenger replied, "No," twice or thrice. (Every time she repeated her question) he said, "No." <b>Then Allah's Messenger added, "It is just a matter of four months and ten days. In the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance, a widow among you should throw a globe of dung when one year has elapsed (i.e. she had to stay in ‘Iddah for the whole one year)."</b></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId205190"></a>Muslim Excuse: Longer ‘Iddah of 3 periods (or more) is necessary in order to ensure that the ‘parentage’ of the child is secure</h3>
<p>Islam apologists argue that 'Iddah is necessary to ensure the parentage of the child is secure. However, this excuse lacks logic and accuracy, as becoming free of the blood from the first menstrual cycle is sufficient to determine if a woman is pregnant and ascertain the parentage of the child.</p>
<p>Islam itself stipulates a shorter 'Iddah period, consisting of becoming free of the first menstrual blood (i.e. 3 to 7 days), for prisoner women, slave women, and free Muslim women who enter an Islamic State from a non-Muslim country. After this first menstrual cycle, Muslim men are allowed to have sexual relations with them.</p>
<p>For instance, Muhammad himself had sexual relations with Saffiyah on the same night her brother, and husband were killed, as she became free from the blood of her first menstrual blood on the same day (Reference: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221101074403/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&idfrom=4080&idto=4081&bk_no=52&ID=1404">Sahih Bukhari</a>).</p>
<p>This demonstrates that the excuse of the child's paternity cannot be used for letting poor women suffer in the name of 'Iddah for 3 menstrual periods, where she cannot marry another man and has to face a lot of other unlogical "restrictions" which make her life difficult. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId917531"></a><span id="Restrictions_upon_the_women_during_.27Iddah:" class="mw-headline">Illogical and Unnecessary Restrictions upon Women during 'Iddah:</span></h2>
<p>During 'Iddah, women not only have to endure long waiting periods but also face additional unnecessary and illogical restrictions imposed by Allah/Muhammad, making their lives more difficult and miserable.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId514374"></a>First Restriction: A woman has to undergo the 'Iddah even if she receives no maintenance money from her husband</h3>
<div class="quotes">Please see the following Fatwa:</div>
<div class="quotes">
<blockquote>The <b>maintenance and providing of shelter for a woman observing the Iddat of Death are not the responsibility of her in-laws. She also does not have the right to take her maintenance out of the Estate of her deceased husband.</b>
<div class="quotes_ref">Reference: <a class="external text" href="https://daruliftaa.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rules_of_iddat-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Dar-ul-Ifta</a></div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As a result:</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman is obligated to undergo the 'Iddah period, which lasts for 4 months and 10 days (or up to 9 months in case of pregnancy). However, she has no entitlement to receive financial support from her husband's estate during this lengthy period of time.</li>
<li>Even if the husband was poor and left no money, the wife is still required to observe the waiting period. This places a significant financial burden on women, especially in Islamic countries where they often lack a source of income. Moreover, Islam restricts their ability to seek employment outside the home during this waiting period, making it even more challenging for them to sustain themselves financially. This situation is truly unfortunate.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId388740"></a>Second Restriction: She is obligated to stay exclusively in the house of her deceased husband during the 'Iddah period<span id="Second_Restriction:_She_has_to_obligatorily_stay_only_in_the_house_of_Husband_during_the_‘Iddah"></span></h3>
<p>As per Islamic Sharia'h, when a husband passes away:</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman is required to spend the entire duration of 'Iddah solely in the house of her late husband.</li>
<li>She is not permitted to stay at any other location, such as her parents' home or that of any other family members (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211028112250/https://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/45291/laws-of-the-iddat/">link1</a> and <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10670/what-a-recently-widowed-woman-is-not-allowed-to-do">link 2</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the problem lies in:</p>
<ul>
<li>What relevance does the location of her 'Iddah have with the parentage of her child?</li>
<li>Why is she not allowed to spend this waiting period in the comfort of her parent's house, where she is surrounded by people who love and care for her? Such a supportive environment could greatly assist her in coping with the sorrow of her husband's demise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Conversely, in her husband's house, she may feel isolated and confined, unable to leave the premises or interact with any men. This situation could be a significant mental anguish for many women, as they are compelled to live in the place where their husbands passed away for a prolonged period of 4 months (or up to 9 months in the case of pregnancy).</p>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId78903"></a>Third Restriction: She must remain in the husband's house, regardless of ownership of the house or lack of maintenance funds left by the husband<span id="She_has_to_stay_in_the_husband’s_house,_even_if_it_doesn’t_belong_to_her_husband,_or_even_if_he_hasn’t_left_any_maintenance_money_for_the_wife"></span></h3>
<div class="quotes"><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/AbuDawud/Hasan/Hadith-2293/">Sunan Abu Dawud 2293</a>:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="quotes">Furay'ah said that she came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him whether she could return to her people, Banu Khidrah, for her husband went out seeking his slaves who ran away. When they met him at al-Qudum, they murdered him.
<p>So I asked the Messenger of Allah: "Should I return to my people, <b>for he did not leave any dwelling house of his own and maintenance for me</b>?</p>
<p>She said: The Messenger of Allah replied: Yes. She said: I came out, and when I was in the apartment or in the mosque, he called for me, or he commanded (someone to call me) and, therefore, I was called.</p>
<p>He said: what did you say? So I repeated my story which I had already mentioned about my husband.</p>
<p><b>Thereupon he said: Stay in your house till the term (of four months and 10 days) lapses.</b></p>
She said: So I passed my waiting period in it (her house) for four months and ten days. When Uthman ibn Affan became a caliph, he sent for me and asked me about that; so I informed him, <b>and he followed it and decided cases accordingly</b>.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The wife is obliged to continue residing in the house of her deceased husband, irrespective of whether the property belongs to her husband or not, and even if he hasn't left any financial provisions for her maintenance.</p>
<p>This requirement places an additional burden on the wife, as she may have no claim to the property or financial support, yet she is compelled to stay in the same dwelling where her husband lived. This can result in financial hardship and emotional distress for the widow, especially if she is left without any source of income or means of sustenance.</p>
<p>Moreover, w<span style="font-size: 1rem;">hy is she compelled to bear the expenses of her daily needs on her own, while her family could have taken care of her easily if she had stayed in the house of her parents/brothers/sisters?</span></p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId813199"></a>Fourth Restriction: She is prohibited from leaving the house, even for daily walks, visiting relatives, or attending social gatherings<span id="Third_Restriction:_She_could_not_leave_the_house_even_for_daily_walks,_or_visit_the_relatives_or_attend_any_social_gathering"></span></h3>
<div class="quotes"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211014113704/https://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/45453/visiting-relatives-in-iddat/">IslamQA Fatwa </a>Website:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="quotes"><b>Question</b>: Is a woman allowed to visit family members like her parents or sisters if she is observing iddat and use the excuse that she will be with her family so she doesn’t  see the problem?<br><b>Answer</b>: A woman who has been divorced is not allowed to leave the confines of her home during the iddat for whatever reason, <b>be it to visit friends or relatives or to attend the funeral of even her parents</b>.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>She could also not go outside for daily walks, as they are not a necessity (<a class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211014114224/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/349861/woman-in-iddah-may-go-out-for-need" rel="nofollow">Fatwa 1</a>, <a class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211014114300/https://idealwoman.org/2021/can-a-woman-go-out-for-a-walk-during-iddat/" rel="nofollow">Fatwa 2</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, a woman observing iddat, whether due to divorce or widowhood, is strictly forbidden from leaving her home premises for any reason. This includes visiting friends or relatives, attending funerals, and even going for daily walks, as they are considered unnecessary activities during this period.</p>
<p>These restrictions raise important questions.</p>
<p>Women, like any human beings, have social and emotional needs. They also require leisure activities such as going to parks, taking daily walks, shopping, dining out, attending social gatherings, visiting their parents' homes, and meeting relatives. Subjecting women to these unilateral restrictions goes against human nature and raises concerns about gender justice. These draconian restrictions practically confine a woman to a solitary existence, adversely affecting her mental and emotional well-being.</p>

<p>Although a woman is allowed to take medical care during ‘Iddah, still she should not use collyrium/kohl as a cure even for any eye disease, while it beautifies her.</p>
<div class="quotes"><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/In-Book/Book-68/Hadith-81/">Sahih Bukhari 68:81</a>:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="quotes">Um Salama said that a woman came to Allah's Messenger and said, "O Allah's Messenger ! The husband of my daughter has died and she is suffering from an eye disease. Can she apply  collyrium/kohl to her eye?" Allah's Messenger replied, "<strong>No," twice or thrice</strong>. (Every time she repeated her question) he said, "<strong>No</strong>."</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="quotes">It is important to note that during the 'Iddah period, the woman is already confined to her house, where there are no non-Mahram men present who can see her beauty. Despite this seclusion, Muhammad still prohibited women from using collyrium/kohl, even for medicinal purposes.</div>

<p>During the 'Iddah period, women are prohibited from wearing good clothes, jewellery, using perfume, applying Henna, combing their hair, and using oil or even washing their faces with aloe. These restrictions are in place even when the woman is confined to her home and not coming into contact with any non-Mahram men.</p>
<div class="quotes"><a href="https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3333">Mishkat al-Masabih 3333</a>:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="quotes">Umm Salama said: God’s Messenger came to visit me when Abu Salama died, and I had put the juice of aloes on myself. He asked me what it was, and I told him it was only the juice of aloes and contained no perfume, so he said, “It gives the face a glow, so apply it only at night and remove it in the daytime, and do not comb yourself with scent or henna, for it is a dye.” I asked God’s Messenger what I should use when combing myself, and he told me to use lote-tree leaves and smear my head copiously with them. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani declared this Hadith to be FAIR (حسن).</div>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Islamic apologists, the rationale behind these restrictions is to maintain modesty and prevent any potential temptation or seduction during this so-called vulnerable period. However, the questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman is not coming into any kind of contact with any man during the 'iddah, as she is not allowed to let any non-Mahram man enter her house, and she is not allowed to leave the house.</li>
<li>So, what is wrong if she wears good clothes, and jewellery, uses perfume and uses henna and combs her hair with oil, and washes her face with aloe in the house, where she is alone, or at maximum with other women?</li>
<li>Who are these people that she’s gonna “seduce” to marry her? The walls?</li>
</ul>
<p>Normal Muslim women and virgin girls are allowed to go outside and participate in various activities without falling into sin. So, why would a divorced or widowed woman be any different in that they will commit a sin by doing these things?</p>
<p>Similarly, if other Muslim women can use Kohl, perfume, jewellery, and wear good clothes without indulging in sin, there is no reason to believe that a divorced/widowed woman would behave differently.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId271198"></a><span id="Reason_for_'iddah_of_a_widow"></span><span id="Reason_for_.27iddah_of_a_widow" class="mw-headline">Islamic <span style="color: #1d00ff;">Excuse</span> for 4 months long 'waiting period' in the case of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Widow</span></span></h2>
<p>Islam advocates claim that the reason for the 4 months and 10 days long 'iddah of a widow is to '<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>M</strong><b>ourn</b></span>' the death of the husband (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/88684/rights-of-a-deceased-husband-on-his-wife">link</a>).</p>
<p>But the questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is there no obligation for any “mourning” (even for a single second) upon a man if his wife dies? He can marry another woman the same night. He can also have intimate relations with his other wives and slave girls the same night too.</li>
<li>Only a woman is compelled to ‘mourn’ the death of her husband. Only she is deprived of her natural need for love and intimacy in the name of ‘mourning,’ and only she has to undergo the strict restrictions of 'Iddah.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, a widow also has to observe 'Iddah, even if <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">(<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/145179/the-waiting-period-of-an-old-woman-after-the-death-of-her-husband">Link</a>)</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>She has never seen his husband after the marriage.</li>
<li>Or even if the marriage has not been consummated.</li>
<li>Or even if she is a minor child.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why should she mourn his death if she has no emotional connection and love for him in her heart? What if the deceased husband was abusive, and the widow harbors feelings of hatred towards him? In such cases, imposing a long waiting period with numerous restrictions is cruel and unnecessary.</p>
<p>Instead, Islam could have allowed widows to make their own decisions about mourning, the duration of 'iddah, and when they are ready for a new relationship. They should have the autonomy to choose where to stay and seek support from their families if needed. Women are capable of making their own choices regarding their personal lives and emotions.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId141688"></a><span id="Reason_for_the_'Iddah_of_a_pregnant_woman"></span><span id="Reason_for_the_.27Iddah_of_a_pregnant_woman" class="mw-headline">Islamic Excuse for long 'waiting period' in the case of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">pregnant woman</span></span></h2>
<p>According to the Quran, the waiting period for a pregnant woman is until the birth of a child (<a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/65.4" rel="nofollow">Quran 65:4</a>).</p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad further explained the <strong>scientific logic</strong> behind this Quranic order, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/AbuDawud/DarusSalam/Hadith-2158/">Sunan Abu Dawud 2158</a>:</p>
<div class="quotes">The Messenger of Allah said: It is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and the last day <b>to water what another has sown with his water (meaning intercourse with a woman who is pregnant from her previous husband).</b></div>
</blockquote>
<p>This practice by Muhammad/Allah reflects a scientific misunderstanding, as modern science has clarified that if a woman is already pregnant, another man's sperm will not affect the fetus. This concept was based on the beliefs of the times of ignorance, and Muhammad adopted it from them, leading to a scientific mistake.</p>
<p>Moreover, the pregnant woman is left to bear the consequences of this practice unilaterally. After the death of her husband, she becomes financially vulnerable, especially if the deceased husband left no money for her and the baby. It is nearly impossible for her to work outside while carrying the baby in her belly. Additionally, during pregnancy, a woman is emotionally sensitive and in need of support, yet she is compelled to stay at her deceased husband's house and endure all these difficulties alone until the birth of the baby.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a pregnant woman should not have to go through the 'Iddah period at all, as the parentage of the child is already known due to her pregnancy. If a husband can divorce a pregnant woman and engage in relationships with other women, it is unfair to deprive the pregnant woman of emotional support, love, attention, and care from a new partner during this challenging time when she needs it the most.</p>
<p>In response to the claims of Islamic apologists, it is important to note that any potential effects on the fetus would be positive. Sex with a man makes the mother happy, resulting in a positive impact on the fetus. There is no logical reason for Allah/Muhammad to oppose such positive effects on the mother and fetus.</p>
<p>Overall, this practice reflects a lack of understanding and consideration for the well-being of pregnant women and their children, and it raises important questions about the fairness and compassion within the teachings of Islam.</p>

<p>The problem is, t<span style="font-size: 1rem;">he whole process of Divorce + ‘Iddah lasts for <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>6 menstrual cycles</strong></span> for a divorced woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The whole process of 3 Talaqs in Islam consists of 3 menstrual cycles of a woman. This means, w</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">hen a Muslim husband initiates divorce, the woman is required to remain in the husband's house for the first <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3 menstrual cycles</strong></span> for the complete process of 3 Talaqs. Throughout this time, the wife and husband are to abstain from physical contact, effectively creating a state of 'solitary confinement' for the woman within the husband's residence. (</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://abukhadeejah.com/divorce-talaq-iddah-remarriage-khula/">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It's important to note that during these three months of the Talaq process, the wife is not allowed to have contact with any man, but the husband is free to engage in intimate relations with other wives or slave girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And after the 3 Talaqs process, she again has to undergo a waiting period of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3 MORE menstrual cycles</strong></span> in the name of 'Iddah (waiting period) (</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://www.islamic-sharia.org/downloads/talaq/">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">). Thus, in total she has to stay in a solitary confinement like situation for 6 months in total. </span></p>

<p>Moreover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muslim are allowed to drive sexual pleasure from the prisoner virgin girls with ‘penetration’ the same night, without giving them any time to mourn their dead family members.</li>
<li>And as far as the prisoner women are concerned, who already have husbands, then penetration in their vaginas is not allowed. But still, Muslims are allowed to undress them and to take all kinds of sexual pleasures with their naked bodies except for penetration.</li>
</ul>

<div class="quotes">وقال عطاء لا بأس أن يصيب من جاريته الحامل ما دون الفرج<br>Atta said: ‘There is no harm to drive sexual pleasure from the body of the pregnant slave/(or prisoner) woman except from vagina’</div>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Islamic Scholars, the Fiqh (Jurisprudence) of Imam Bukhari lies in the “Headings of Chapters” of his Book. And Imam Bukhari gave this heading in his book Sahih Bukhari (<a href="https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&ID=4081&bk_no=52&flag=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Chapter: If one buys a slave woman, can he then take her along with him in a journey without her completing her waiting period?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under this heading, Imam Bukhari writes:</p>
<div class="quotes">
<blockquote>ولم ير الحسن بأسا أن يقبلها أو يباشرها. وقال ابن عمر ـ رضى الله عنهما ـ إذا وهبت الوليدة التي توطأ أو بيعت أو عتقت فليستبرأ رحمها بحيضة، ولا تستبرأ العذراء. وقال عطاء لا بأس أن يصيب من جاريته الحامل ما دون الفرج.
<p>Translation:</p>
Hasan Basri finds nothing objectionable in kissing a woman or to having sex with her. And Ibn Umar said that such a slave woman who is given as a present, or who is sold, or who is made free, but sex had been done with her before that, then she had to undergo a waiting period. <b>And Atta said if a slave woman had become pregnant (from the earlier owner/husband), then still pleasure could be derived from the whole of her body, except for her vagina.</b>

</div>
<p>In order to understand the trauma of those captive women due to the killing of their relatives, please see the following tradition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=4A-4ZC4l0dMC&pg=PA122&lpg=PA122&dq=she+commanded+that+Safiyyah+should+be+kept+behind+him+and+that+the+Messenger+of+God+had+chosen+her+for+himself&source=bl&ots=pHDBKo-6Bv&sig=W8sWDq8ZJ4nLwFZpsA1obfYZJ48&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwizjuC41L7bAhVHXRQKHSEhD7EQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=she%20commanded%20that%20Safiyyah%20should%20be%20kept%20behind%20him%20and%20that%20the%20Messenger%20of%20God%20had%20chosen%20her%20for%20himself&f=false">History of Tabari, Volume 8, Page 112</a>:</p>
<div class="quotes">Ibn Ishaq said: After the Messenger of God conquered al-Qamus, Safiyyah bint Huyayy was brought to him, and another woman with her. Bilal (a companion), who was the one who brought them, led them past some of the slain Jews. When the woman who was with Safiyyah saw them, she cried out, struck her face, and poured dust on her head. When the Messenger of God saw her, he said, "Take this she-devil away from me!" ... The Messenger of God said to Bilal, when he saw the Jewish woman doing what he saw her do, "Are you devoid of mercy, Bilal, that you take two women past their slain men?"</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, there are double standards here:</p>
<ul>
<li>On one hand, Islamic apologists claim that Muslim women are not allowed to be wed during 3 periods/months long 'Iddah while she is mentally under stress after the divorce.</li>
<li>But on the other hand, they deny any such mental stress for the prisoner women and girls, and what to talk about divorce, but even after killing all the men of their family, Muslim men use them as sex object the same night. They are provided with no time to get out of their mental stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to Islam, Judaism and Christianity allowed the prisoner women to mourn their relatives for one complete month, during which men were not allowed to take any other sexual services from them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2021&version=NIV">Bible, Deuteronomy, Chap 21</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="quotes"><b>Marrying a Captive Woman</b>
<p>(10) When you go to war against your enemies and the Lord your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives,</p>
<p>(11) if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife.</p>
<p>(12) Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails</p>
<p>(13) and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. <b>After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month</b>, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife.</p>
(14) If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her like a slave, since you have dishonored her.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad rejected the Sharia of Moses in this case, and he followed the laws of the pagan Arab society of that time, as it benefitted him and the Muslims financially and they were free to seek sexual pleasure through the prisoner women the same night.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId998564"></a>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>Is this the same so-called giving Rights with JUSTICE to women in Islam, which Muslims boast about in comparison to the Equal rights of women in the Western world? </p>
<p>All people with even the slightest intelligence can see that this is not called giving rights with Justice to women, but it is oppression against women and Injustice towards them. </p>

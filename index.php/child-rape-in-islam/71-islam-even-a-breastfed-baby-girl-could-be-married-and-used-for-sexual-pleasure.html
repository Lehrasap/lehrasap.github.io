<blockquote>
<div align="right">فإنه لا حرج في تقبيل الزوجة ‌الصغيرة بشهوة ‌والمفاخذة ونحو ذلك ولو كانت لا تطيق الجماع، وقد بين العلماء رحمهم الله تعالى أن الأصل جواز استمتاع الرجل بزوجته كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر، وذكروا في ذلك استمناءه بيدها ومداعبتها وتقبيلها وغير ذلك</div>
<p>There’s no issue in the sexual kissing, thighing..etc of a minor wife, even if she can't yet endure sexual intercourse. Scholars have stated that the default ruling is that a man can enjoy his wife however he wants as long as no harm is caused. The examples they mentioned for this include masturbating with her hand, fondling, kissing, etc.</p>

<p>A free minor girl may have some protection that her father does not hand her over to her husband till she is 9 years old, or strong enough to bear the penetration. Nevertheless, minor slave girls in Islam were totally vulnerable and they had no fathers there to protect them. </p>
<p>Muslim men got their hands upon minor slave girls by making them captives through wars, or directly buying them from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery. </p>
<p class="western">Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (also known as the younger Imam Malik) wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">A slave-mother and her baby could be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) after baby has his two molar tooth (i.e. about 6 months)</blockquote>
<p class="western">A mother could only weep the tears of blood if her 6 months old baby is separated from her and sold in the slave market and then used for sexual pleasure by the Muslim owner. </p>
<p>Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (who is also known as the younger Imam Malik), writes in his Fiqh book (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>واستبراء الامة في انتقال الملك حيضة انتقل الملك ببيع أو هبة أو سبي أو غير ذلك. ومن هي في حيازته قدحاضت عنده ثم إنه اشتراها فلا استبراء عليها إن لم تكن تخرج. واستبراء الصغيرة في البيع إن كانت توطأ ثلاثة أشهر</p>
<p>And the Istibra (i.e. waiting period) of a slave woman during the transfer of ownership occurs through sale, gift, capture, or other means. If a person possesses a slave woman who is menstruating, and then he purchases her, there is no requirement for Istibra (i.e. waiting period) ....<strong> As for the Istibra (waiting period) of a minor slave girl through sale is concerned, then it is three months</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Imam Ibn Qayyam al-Jawziyya recorded (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150512090314/http://islamport.com/w/qym/Web/3181/859.htm">link</a>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>في الفصول روى عن أحمد في رجل خاف أن تنشق مثانته من الشبق أو تنشق انثياه لحبس الماء في زمن رمضان يستخرج الماء ولم يذكر بأي شيء يستخرجه قال: “وعندي أنه يستخرجه بما لا يفسد صوم غيره كاستمنائه بيده أو ببدن زوجته أو أمته غير الصائمة فإن كان له أمة طفلة أو صغيرة استمنى بيدها وكذلك الكافرة ويجوز وطؤها فيما دون الفرج فإن أراد الوطء في الفرج مع إمكان إخراج الماء بغيره فعندي أنه لا يجوز لأن الضرورة إذا رفعت حرام ما وراءها</p>
<p>Ahmed said about a man who feared that sperm would flow from his penis or that his testicles were unable to retain semen during Ramadan, he can ejaculate. But he didn’t say with what. In my opinion, he must release it with what would not spoil the fast of others. Like masturbating with his hand, or against the body of his wife or a slave who is not fasting. <strong>If he has a child or a small slave, let him masturbate with her hand</strong>. The Same for the unbelieving woman, he can penetrate her but not in her vagina. But if he wants to penetrate her vagina while he has other options to ejaculate, this would not be allowed in my opinion. If the need is fulfilled, it is forbidden to go beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Islam handed over captive minor girls to Jihadists, where they were alone in their tents and fully on their mercy. There was no one to stop them from raping these small captive girls. </p>
<p>And it was a regular practice of Muhammad's Companions to rape minor PRISONER girls. Ali raped a minor captive girl on the same night when she was made captive after the war.</p>
<p><a href="https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2">Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Buraydah: <br>I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: "O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!" Ali replied: "Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, <em><strong>and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.</strong></em>" ...<br><strong>Grading: </strong>Classed <em>Sahih</em> by al-Arna'ut</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Istibra </em>is a period of sexual abstinence required till the first period of the captive girl is over. This is to ensure no confusion on paternity. Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any<em> Istibra</em>, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة<br>"It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing<em> Istibra</em>, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.<br>As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a <em><strong>virgin and not pubescent</strong></em>. He recognized that someone like her need not observe<em> Istibra</em>, and<em><strong> it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.</strong></em>"<br>Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.</p>

<p><a href="https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&ID=4081&bk_no=52&flag=1">Sahih Bukhari (link)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ولم ير الحسن بأسا أن يقبلها أو يباشرها. وقال ابن عمر ـ رضى الله عنهما ـ إذا وهبت الوليدة التي توطأ أو بيعت أو عتقت فليستبرأ رحمها بحيضة، ولا تستبرأ العذراء. وقال عطاء لا بأس أن يصيب من جاريته الحامل ما دون الفرج.<br>Translation:<br>Al-Hasan did not see any harm in kissing or having sexual intercourse with a female slave. Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: "If a female slave who has been engaged in sexual intercourse is given as a gift, sold, or freed, she should be purified by waiting for her menstrual cycle. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, a <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">virgin</span> does not require purification <span style="color: #0005ff; text-decoration: underline;">(i.e. the minor girls are also virgins)</span></strong></span>."  And Atta said if a slave woman had become pregnant (from the earlier owner/husband), then still pleasure could be derived from whole of her body, except for her vagina.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Risala is a famous treatise of Maliki fiqh (jurisprudence). It says the same i.e. virgin woman (including virgin minor girls) don't need any waiting period and can be raped immediately. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/lawbase/risalah_maliki/book33.html">The Risalah, 33:5 (Maliki Fiqh)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Istibra' is observed in the case of a slavegirl who changes ownership. It is one menstruation. Ownership changes by selling, giving away, capture, or any other way. If the woman menstruates after being in the possession of the new master (i.e. she was a minor girl) before he has bought her, then <strong>she does not have to observe an istibra' if she has not gone out</strong>. The istibra' for a child when she is sold is three months as it is for a woman who no longer menstruates. <strong>There is no istibra' for a woman who has never had intercourse</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please imagine the profound trauma endured by the small girls who experienced the unimaginable horrors inflicted upon them. In a single day, they tragically lost their fathers and brothers to Muslims. Shortly thereafter, they were forcibly expelled from their homes, subjected to looting by the same perpetrators. To compound their suffering, they were then cruelly torn apart from their mothers on that very same night and then they were raped by Jihadists.</p>
<p>Muhammad didn't even grant the poor small girls the period of one month to come out of the shock of the killing of their fathers and brothers (like the Jews/Christians did), before raping them <a href="../islamic-slavery/47-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity.html">(link).</a></p>
<p>If any God really exists, then can He ever bring such shame to humanity?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people have lost all their <em><strong>Humanity</strong></em> and all their <em><strong>Shame</strong></em> due to religious brainwashing. They still come out and start defending Islam against this <strong><em>ugliest crime</em></strong> which it committed against humanity. </p>
<p>This was the practice of Companions and all Muslims of the last 1400 years, till the <em><strong>secular non-religious West</strong></em> saved humanity against these evil religious practices of slavery and raping.</p>

<p>At a certain juncture, it becomes necessary to transcend the 1400-year-old tenets of Sharia law. There are no alternative paths available to us. For example, the Quran says that even a minor girl (under the age of 9) could be married and penetrated.</p>
<blockquote>(<a href="http://www.quranwebsite.com/text55/065___at_talaq.html">Quran 65:4</a>) And if you are in doubt about those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, (you should know that) their waiting period is three months,<b> and the same applies to those (minor girls) who have not menstruated as yet</b>.</blockquote>
<p>Modoudi's Tafseer of verse 65:4 (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=65&verse=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>They may not have menstruated as yet <b>either because of young age</b>, or delayed menstrual discharge as it happens in the case of some women, the waiting-period of such a woman is the same as of the woman, who has stopped menstruation, that is three months from the time divorce was pronounced.<br><b>Here, one should bear in mind the fact that according to the explanations given in the Qur'an the question of the waiting period arises in respect of the women with whom marriage may have been consummated, for there is no waiting-period in case divorce is pronounced before the consummation of marriage. (Al-Ahzab: 49). Therefore, making mention of the waiting-period for the girls who have not yet menstruated, clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl in marriage at this age but it is also permssible for the husband to consummate marriage with her. Now, obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Qur'an has held as permissible.</b></blockquote>

Ibn Abd al-Barr, may Allah have mercy on him, said: "Scholars unanimously agree that a father has the right to marry off his young daughter without her consent, and he is not required to consult her. The Prophet, peace be upon him, married Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, when she was a young girl of six or seven, and her father married her to him." (See "Al-Istidhkar" 16/49). Ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, said: "The young virgin girl can be married off by her father without her consent, except in rare cases." (See "Fath al-Bari" 9/239) ... If the father marries off his non-adult daughter, she has no choice once she reaches adulthood.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_VmVKG9iA&t=418s">This video from "Nabi Asli" </a>makes it more clear.</p>
<p><!--StartFragment --> Sharia Law book titled "Reliance of the Traveler"( or Umdat al Salik in Arabic), which is one of the most renowned classical manuals of fiqh, on page 592 (<a href="../../images/fistula_Reliance_traveler.jpg">link</a>):<small><small><small><br></small></small></small></p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>The Indemnity for Bodily Injuries</strong></div>
<div>A full indemnity is also paid for injuries which paralyze these members,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> or for injuring the peritoneal wall between the vagina and rectum (anus) so they become one aperture</span>.</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">What does this mean?</span></p>
<p>The forced penetration by an adult man to the underage girl causes her small vagina to rupture and rip apart up to her rectum. It is known as "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vaginal+fistula&oq=vagin&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i512l4j69i60j69i61.1646j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Fistula</a>" in medical terminology.<br>You can imagine the pain that the little girl suffers because of this action.</p>
<p>This is another Sharia book titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062229/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Behisti_Zewar.jpg">Heavenly Ornaments or Bahisti Zewar (page 50)</a> that also mentions this type of injury. The paragraph talks about ghusl or ritual washing after having intercourse:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If a woman is underage but not so small that if one has intercourse with her <strong>there is a fear of the vaginal tissues tearing to such an extent that the vagina and anus will virtually come together</strong>; then by the insertion of the glans of the penis into her vagina ghusl will become Fardh (i.e. obligatory) on the man if he has reached the age of puberty. However, if there is the aforementioned fear in a very minor girl, then mere insertion of the penis does not render ghusl obligatory.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that if the man is an adult and he is worried that inserting his genitalia into a prepubescent, or infant or a baby girl can cause the tearing of the vagina to the anus, then just insert the head of his penis. .... Unbelievable!</p>
<p>We can read a similar explanation from another Sharia book titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062510/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Digest_Muhammad_law.jpg">A Digest of Moohummudan Law, Part II, translated by Neil Baillie. This is about the Marriage Law in Islam, page 26</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">When a man has had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of nine years, <strong>and has ruptured the parts (i.e. her vagina, tearing apart because of what the adult man did to her)</strong>. It is unlawful for him to have further connection with her (i.e. he cannot have a sex with her), <strong>but she is not released from her ties, if connected with him by marriage or slavery</strong>. This means that if the vagina ruptures, then the man should not continue the coitus. <strong>But that doesn't mean that the girl can divorce the man, if the man is her husband, or that the girl is free if the man is her slave master</strong>. If no rupture has taken place, the prohibition is not incurred according to the most valid opinion. </span></div>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This means that if no rupture happens, then the man can go ahead to continue with the coitus. But if the rapture happens, then such a girl cannot have sex her entire life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This is DOUBLE cruelty against the poor minor girl:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">First and foremost, she is condemned to endure the anguish and physical trauma of the fistula throughout her entire existence. </span></li>
<li>Secondly, she is trapped in a perpetual state of being unable to liberate herself from him through divorce, forced to confront the presence of the abhorrent individual who violated and subjected her to such excruciating torment. This inflicts not only physical agony but also profound mental anguish upon her.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that the rupture incident is mentioned repeatedly in many Sharia books, means that such horrific accidents happen often during child marriages.</p>

<p>Shia Islam also allows marriage with a minor girl. </p>
<p>Shia Imam Khomeini wrote (<a href="http://islamicvirtues.com/2013/12/28/deriving-sexual-pleasure-from-infants/">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>مسألة 12 : لا يجوز وطء الزوجة قبل إكمال تسع سنين ، دواما كان النكاح أو منقطعا ، و أما سائر الاستمتاعات كاللمس بشهوة و الضم و التفخيذ فلا بأس بها حتى فى الرضيعة ولو وطئها قبل التسع ولم يفضها لم يترتّب عليه شي‏ء غير الإثم على الأقوى، وإن أفضاها - بأن جعل مسلكي البول والحيض واحدا أو مسلكي الحيض والغائط واحدا - حرم عليه وطؤها أبدا، لكن على الأحوط في الصورة الثانية. وعلى أيّ حال لم تخرج عن زوجيّته على الأقوى، فيجري عليها أحكامها من التوارث وحرمة الخامسة وحرمة اُختها معها وغيرها</p>
<p>Tahreer al-Waseelah, volume 2, page 343</p>
<p>Issue #12: It is not permissible to have sexual intercourse (with one’s wife) before she reaches 9 years in age, be it in Nikaah (permanent marriage) or Mut’a (temporary marriage). As for all other pleasures such as lustful touch, embracing, and thighing, there is no problem in it, even if she is a suckling baby. A man having intercourse with a girl younger than nine years of age has not committed a crime, but only an infraction, if the girl is not permanently damaged by vagina and anus becoming one. If the girl, however, is permanently damaged, the man must provide for her all her life. But this girl will not count as one of the man's four permanent wives. He also is not permitted to marry the girl's sister.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Shia Imam Sistani wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2368/">Ruling 2428</a>:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If a person marries a non-bālighah girl, it is unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her until she has completed nine lunar years. However, if he does have sexual intercourse with her before then, it will not be unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her after she reaches bulūgh even if she has developed a cloacal abnormality (the meaning of which was explained in Ruling 2399). And if she has developed a cloacal abnormality, he must pay her blood money (diyah), which is equivalent to the blood money for killing a human being, and he must also pay for her living expenses forever, even after divorce. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, even if that girl marries someone else after getting divorced [he must still pay for her living expenses] </span><span>....</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2367/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cloacal abnormality explained in #2399 point 6:</strong></span></a></p>
<p><span> “the woman had a cloacal abnormality, meaning that her urethral opening and vagina had become one [vesicovaginal fistula], or her vagina and anus had become one [rectovaginal fistula], or all three had become one [persistent cloaca], …”</span></p>

<p><strong>Firstly: The rate of death among “Teen Mothers” and their babies is the highest</strong></p>
<p>The whole internet is full of this information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy">link</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>The rate of death of Teen Mothers is the highest.</li>
<li>And the rate of death among their babies is also the highest.</li>
<li>And not only the death rate, but these children also suffer highly from other mental and physical handicaps. </li>
<li>And birth becomes very often complicated and OPERATION has to be performed instead of natural birth. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Secondly: Psychiatrists are WISER than Allah</strong></p>
<p>Islam sends a minor girl to an old man of the age of her father and grandfather so that that old man can take sexual pleasure from her.</p>
<p>But Psychiatrists claim that separating a minor girl from her parents, and then sending her alone to an old man for being used as a sexual object, causes a huge psychological depression to her. </p>
<p>While Allah claims that he is the All-Wisest, and he does not do any injustice to such a minor girl, and she is not depressed. </p>
<p>So, who is truthful? </p>
<p>Allah or these Psychologists?</p>
<h2 class="indexed"><span id="does-verse-4-6-prohibit-marriage-with-minor-girls" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_text"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId10537"></a>Does verse 4:6 prohibit marriage with minor girls?</span></h2>
<p>There was an Ijma (إجماع i.e. CONSENSUS) of Muslim Ummah that marriage with a minor girl is allowed. But in the present century, few modern Muslim Preachers (and the Quranists, i.e. those who reject Hadith) have started denying it. They are trying to misuse verse 4:6 as an argument to deny marriage to minor girls in Islam. </p>
<p>Verse <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&verse=6">4:6</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>وَٱبْتَلُوا۟</strong> ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ</p>
<p>And test the orphans until when they reached the age of marriage (Nikah), then if you perceive in them sound judgement then deliver to them their wealth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Modern Muslim preachers claim that one gets sound judgement about his wealth when one is already an adult person. Thus, this means that Islam prescribed that one can marry only after becoming an adult. </p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Please note that the word <a class="mw-redirect" title="Nikah" href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah">Nikah</a> has a double meaning in the Arabic language:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to the Islamic Sharia, "Nikah" is a terminology, whose meaning in Islamic Sharia is “marriage”. </li>
<li>While the literal meaning of “Nikah” in the Arabic language is "<a title="Nikah (Sexual Consummation of Marriage)" href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah_%28Sexual_Consummation_of_Marriage%29">To do Sexual Intercourse</a>"</li>
</ol>
<p>It becomes even more evident from another verse of Quran 17:34:</p>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/17.34?Context=3" rel="nofollow">Quran 17:34</a></p>
<blockquote>وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ <b>أَشُدَّهُۥ</b> ۚ<br>Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of <b>full strength</b></blockquote>
<p>The word أَشُدَّهُ (full strength) in this verse means the age when young boys and girls start feeling the desire/strength to do sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>Please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>As far as Shar'i Nikah (marriage) is concerned, then there is no condition present in it of reaching the أَشُدَّهُ (i.e. Full Strength to do the act of intercourse).</li>
<li>And the proof is that prophet Muhammad himself did the Shar'i Nikah with 'Aisha, when she was only 6 years old.</li>
<li>And no one tests a 6 years old child for handing over his/her property to him/her, as a 6-year-old child has neither أَشُدَّهُ (Strength/Desire) nor he/she has any kind of “sound judgement” to look after his/her property.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the Shar'i Nikah has nothing to do with the أَشُدَّهُ (strength), as Muhammad did this Shar'i Nikah with 6 years 'Aisha.</p>
<p>Actually, even at the age of 9, when 'Aisha finally came to the house of Muhammad for the consummation of marriage, she was still not mentally sound enough to look after any property or business. It is evident from the following hadith:</p>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-6130/" rel="nofollow">Sahih Bukhari 6130:</a></p>
<blockquote>Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.</blockquote>
<p>Fourthly, according to Islamic Sharia:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a girl reaches puberty, then she herself gets the right to give her consent for the marriage or to deny the marriage.</li>
<li>But if she is a minor or prepubescent girl, then her father/guardian could wed her to anyone, even without her consent (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses">link</a>).</li>
<li>And if she is prepubescent and also an orphan, then her guardian has the right to wed her with himself (even without her consent), in order to get her property and wealth.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is evident from the following Hadith:</p>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5064/" rel="nofollow">Sahih Bukhari 5064:</a></p>
<blockquote>Narrated 'Urwa: that he asked `Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, "O my nephew! <b>(This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr (bride-dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr</b>, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them."</blockquote>
<p>It is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:</p>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3" rel="nofollow">Quran 4:127:</a></p>
<blockquote>You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) <b>to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage</b>, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans." The good you do is known to God.</blockquote>
<p>The orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reasons that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. </li>
<li>Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). </li>
<li>Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. </li>
<li>Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no longer considered an orphan. </li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, Islamqa.com, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet, also refutes these modern Muslim preachers regarding verse 6:4 (<a href="https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>This verse 4:6 explains that an orphan’s money is given to him/her after they reach puberty and attain sound judgement. What’s meant by sound judgment is sound management of money. This can only happen after puberty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Reaching Nikah” mentioned in the verse means reaching puberty which can be known through sings such as menstruation for females and the growth of pubic hair. The verse used the expression “reaching Nikah” to actually mean “reaching puberty” because in most cases, it’s adults who perform Nikah. But this doesn’t mean that it’s not possible for non-adults to perform Nikah, which is permissible as proven by the Quran, Sunnah and the consensus of scholars. Plus, the same Surah and the same context of verses proves it (the permissibility of child marriage). (The verse that speaks about giving an orphan his money when he/she reaches Nikah is verse no.6) Verse no.3 says: “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. ”.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This verse proves it’s allowed to marry an orphan. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And an orphan cannot be an adult</span></strong>. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, "It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of Allah's Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning women..' (4.127) “<a class="external free" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965" rel="nofollow">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“This shows it’s allowed to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans</strong></span>.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your (newborn) sons and let your women-folk (i.e. newborn girls) live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.</blockquote>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/7.127?Context=3" rel="nofollow">Quran 7:127</a>:</p>
<blockquote>وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ أَتَذَرُ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُۥ لِيُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَءَالِهَتَكَ ۚ قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْىِۦ نِسَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَٰهِرُونَ</blockquote>

<p>In the above verses, the word <i>"Nisaa'"</i> is referring to female infants.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Quran used the expression “Nisaa’ orphans” to mean “female orphans”. Orphans cannot be adults which means non-adults can be included in the word Nisaa’.</p>
<p><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3" rel="nofollow">Quran 4:127:</a></p>

<p>An Islamic apologist website wrote (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/476539/ruling-on-giving-in-marriage-a-young-girl">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic principle is that there is nothing in Shari‘ah that stipulates a particular age of marriage for the man or the woman. The issue in question, which is related to specifying a particular age for marriage, falls under a general matter, which is: Does the guardian have the right to restrict what is permissible for the public interest? This is one of the matters of ijtihad, so no one should disapprove of it for what his ijtihad has led him to.</p>
<p>A resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy on the marriage of young girls reads: "The age of marriage for young girls is determined with the permission of the judge and the matter is left (entrusted) to the ruler in each country according to the circumstances of time, place, and age, in a way that achieves the interest of all."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>It is against Islamic rule that the Halal of Allah cannot be made Haram by any man.</p>
<p>Even Muhammad was not allowed to make Halal of Allah haram.</p>
<p>And indeed Muhammad didn't make it to Haram in the incident where a foster father married his adopted daughter for her beauty and wealth. At maximum, Muhammad asked such men in the Quran to do justice and pay full Haq Mahr to their adopted minor daughters, but nothing was made illegal.</p>
<p>That is why Sahaba were raping minor captive and minor slave girls.</p>
<p>Throughout the Islamic history of 14 centuries, no one stipulated sex with minor girls to be Haram.</p>

</ul>
<p>Just look at the Quran, which claims that its verses are Clear and Easy to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its verses are "easy to understand" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/54.17">54:17</a>)</li>

<p>However according to modern Muslim apologists and the Quranists, then this Quran was neither a guide nor mercy for billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years, as minor girls were being wed and being used for sexual pleasures. And millions of minor slave girls were also bought from the slave markets, and used for sexual pleasure. </p>
<p>Who is then responsible for the plight of these minor girls?  </p>
<p dir="ltr">Were really Muslims of the last 1400 years responsible, who were reading this Quran and pondering upon it, and despite that came to absolutely wrong and horrible conclusions? </p>

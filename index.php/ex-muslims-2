Just go and live your life. Stop comparing Islam. Just do something else.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you accept the same rule that the prophet should have quietly left the pagan religion without making a noise about it and no one would have noticed and missed him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see your double standards here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see, if the Quran and Muslims have a right to criticize religions and gods of others, then humanity within us guides is clearly that others also have the same right to criticize Islam and Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamists' Objection 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: Why are ex-Muslims obsessed with Islam? You left Islam, yet you are always talking about Islam. Why don't you criticize other religions like Christianity and Judaism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the criticism of Islam and the preaching of Islam go hand in hand. There are no limitations on criticizing ideologies like Islam, just as there are no limitations on Muslims preaching Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Muslims wants to have a right to &quot;PREACH&quot;, then they also have to give right to others to &quot;CRITICIZE&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing Practical Oppression&lt;/strong&gt;: Ex-Muslims focus their criticism on Islam because we face real and present persecution and oppression from Islamic societies. We are not subjected to the same level of persecution by Jews or Christians. It makes sense to address and combat the source of our suffering, which is currently Islam and the Muslim community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical Precedent&lt;/strong&gt;: When the Prophet Muhammad faced persecution by the Meccan pagans, the Quran's criticisms were directed solely at the pagans and their gods. He did not criticize Jews, Christians, Hindus, or any other religion because they were not the source of his persecution at that time. Similarly, when he moved to Medina and faced opposition from Jews and Christians for not accepting him as a prophet, the Quran's condemnations were directed at them, not at other religions that were not persecuting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Standards&lt;/strong&gt;: Islam and Muslims often exhibit an obsession with ex-Muslims, actively persecuting and even calling for the killing of apostates under the charge of Murtad (apostasy). It is not ex-Muslims who cannot let go of Islam; it is Islam that refuses to let go of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand for Equal Rights&lt;/strong&gt;: Ultimately, our criticism stems from a demand for equal human rights and justice. We seek only the same freedoms and rights that are afforded to others. The call for equal rights is a fundamental principle of justice, and anyone who values humanity should recognize that our demands are justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, ex-Muslims focus on criticizing Islam not out of an obsession, but out of a need to address the tangible persecution they face. This criticism is aimed at achieving equal rights and justice, principles that are inherently fair and just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Even after Muhammad left the pagan religion, still this Quran kept on teaching that Kafirs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Ex-Muslims claim that Islamic preachers are only showing double standards, where they make Quranic/Prophetic criticism HALAL, but if others criticize Islam, then they label it as an obsession. &lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamists' Objection 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &quot;If you have left Islam, then live your life and there is no need to keep returning back to Islam and Muslims. Just go and live your life. Stop comparing Islam. Just do something else.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you accept the same rule that the prophet should have quietly left the pagan religion without making a noise about it and no one would have noticed and missed him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see your double standards here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see, if the Quran and Muslims have a right to criticize religions and gods of others, then humanity within us guides is clearly that others also have the same right to criticize Islam and Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamists' Objection 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: Why are ex-Muslims obsessed with Islam? You left Islam, yet you are always talking about Islam. Why don't you criticize other religions like Christianity and Judaism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the criticism of Islam and the preaching of Islam go hand in hand. There are no limitations on criticizing ideologies like Islam, just as there are no limitations on Muslims preaching Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Muslims wants to have a right to &quot;PREACH&quot;, then they also have to give right to others to &quot;CRITICIZE&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing Practical Oppression&lt;/strong&gt;: Ex-Muslims focus their criticism on Islam because we face real and present persecution and oppression from Islamic societies. We are not subjected to the same level of persecution by Jews or Christians. It makes sense to address and combat the source of our suffering, which is currently Islam and the Muslim community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical Precedent&lt;/strong&gt;: When the Prophet Muhammad faced persecution by the Meccan pagans, the Quran's criticisms were directed solely at the pagans and their gods. He did not criticize Jews, Christians, Hindus, or any other religion because they were not the source of his persecution at that time. Similarly, when he moved to Medina and faced opposition from Jews and Christians for not accepting him as a prophet, the Quran's condemnations were directed at them, not at other religions that were not persecuting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Standards&lt;/strong&gt;: Islam and Muslims often exhibit an obsession with ex-Muslims, actively persecuting and even calling for the killing of apostates under the charge of Murtad (apostasy). It is not ex-Muslims who cannot let go of Islam; it is Islam that refuses to let go of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand for Equal Rights&lt;/strong&gt;: Ultimately, our criticism stems from a demand for equal human rights and justice. We seek only the same freedoms and rights that are afforded to others. The call for equal rights is a fundamental principle of justice, and anyone who values humanity should recognize that our demands are justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, ex-Muslims focus on criticizing Islam not out of an obsession, but out of a need to address the tangible persecution they face. This criticism is aimed at achieving equal rights and justice, principles that are inherently fair and just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Even after Muhammad left the pagan religion, still this Quran kept on teaching that Kafirs:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Are ex-Muslims cowards for hiding their identities?</title>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;To those who criticize ex-Muslims for hiding their identity, we'd like to point out that even the Prophet Muhammad himself initially kept his prophethood hidden for three years. Additionally, many of his companions hid their beliefs to avoid harm, as encouraged by Quran 3:28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran 3:28:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Let) not take the believers, the disbelievers (as) allies from instead of the believers. And whoever does that, then not he (has) from Allah in anything &lt;strong&gt;except that you &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;fear&lt;/span&gt; from them, (as) a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0013ff;&quot;&gt;precaution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Muslims face significant danger and persecution from radical Muslims, far surpassing what the early Muslims faced from pagans. While it's true that pagans restricted the preaching of Islam and conversion, it's important to recognize that Islam and its radical followers sometimes perpetuate similar restrictions and even worse treatment of those who leave the faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If pagans put restrictions upon preaching Islam and conversion of religion, then they acted wrongfully. But unfortunately, Islam and its radical followers are themselves following the Sunnah (practice) of those pagans, whom they condemned for that crime. Actually, their behaviour is even worse than the pagans in this regard and they kill ex-Muslims immediately for leaving Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ibrahim declared her wife Sarah to be his sister and also sent her to the King&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) told lies three times, including when he referred to his wife Sarah as his sister to protect her from the king's intentions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2371&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2371&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophet Ibrahim never told a lie but only thrice: ... He had come in a land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with Sara. She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these people were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, &lt;strong&gt;so if they ask you tell them that you are my sister &lt;/strong&gt;... so he (the king) sent someone and she was brought to him, &lt;strong&gt;and (instead of fighting against the kidnapping of Sarah) Ibrahim stood in prayer &lt;/strong&gt;... (and the tradition further tells after this cowardice of Ibrahim, Allah had to defend Sarah himself from being raped by the King).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, Ex-Muslims have all the right to hide their identity to save themselves from the HARM of Islam and radical Muslims. And these radical Muslims should be ashamed of their evil intentions of killing innocent ex-Muslims, and they should reform themselves instead of blaming ex-Muslims for cowardice. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<title>Intelligence and Critical Thinking is a CURSE for Muslim Kids</title>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Some children possess exceptional intelligence and critical thinking skills, making them resilient against religious indoctrination. Unfortunately, this can become a burden for these kids as they find it difficult to accept the deceptions of religion, leading them to leave Islam at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;However, sharing their true beliefs with their parents, family, and friends is not an option for them. They lack someone they can confide in about their struggles and doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;For Muslim parents, Islam comes first, and their children come later.  These young individuals must pretend to be devout Muslims to please their parents and gain their approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Imagine a child who no longer believes in Islam, yet his parents wake him up at 5 o'clock every morning to attend mosque prayers in Islamic countries. He is obligated to pray five times a day, a routine that can be overwhelming. Even ex-Muslim girls, who are not required to go to mosques, face difficulties praying five times daily at home. Actually, they have to face more hardships as the Hijab suffocates them their entire lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Schools also play a significant role in religious indoctrination, teaching Islamic studies, the Quran, and Jurisprudence. In some cases, even science classes may propagate misinformation, such as dismissing the Theory of Evolution as a Western conspiracy to mislead Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more religious households, ex-Muslim children may be prohibited from engaging in activities like watching TV dramas, films, or playing video games. Instead, they are compelled to attend Quran School daily, spending hours there every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kids have to lead double lives, and have to fake it all day with no place to drop the facade without fear of retaliation. It is exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their suffering does not end there. When they become adults, they already know they cannot allow themselves to fall in love, as they don't know a single non-religious person they can choose as a partner. They end up in arranged marriages with religious partners, especially difficult for ex-Muslim girls, who know they have to provide sex services to their religious Muslim husbands their entire life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, it was believed that only a few girls left Islam, but it appears that the number of ex-Muslim girls exceeds that of ex-Muslim boys. This could be attributed to the added challenges imposed on their lives by Islam. Despite not believing in Allah, they must wear hijab almost constantly, even inside their homes, to avoid arousing male family members. Leaving the house requires the company of brothers or fathers, significantly limiting their freedom compared to ex-Muslim boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This fact is confirmed by thousands of stories of ex-Muslims in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/&quot;&gt;ex-Muslim subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, where the number of ex-Muslim girls far exceeds that of ex-Muslim boys, and they endure more suffering compared to boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Another burden they face is the inability to educate their own children about the issues with Islam.  Their male children are circumcised, and they are compelled to send their children to Quran Schools. This is perhaps the most depressing matter for an ex-Muslim parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plight of ex-Muslim individuals needs to be brought to the world's attention. Currently, many people are unaware of what it means to be an ex-Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Overall, the plight of ex-Muslim individuals needs greater awareness and understanding in society. They face unique challenges and deserve support and empathy to navigate their journey outside of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;In more religious households, ex-Muslim children may be prohibited from engaging in activities like watching TV dramas, films, or playing video games. Instead, they are compelled to attend Quran School daily, spending hours there every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kids have to lead double lives, and have to fake it all day with no place to drop the facade without fear of retaliation. It is exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their suffering does not end there. When they become adults, they already know they cannot allow themselves to fall in love, as they don't know a single non-religious person they can choose as a partner. They end up in arranged marriages with religious partners, especially difficult for ex-Muslim girls, who know they have to provide sex services to their religious Muslim husbands their entire life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, it was believed that only a few girls left Islam, but it appears that the number of ex-Muslim girls exceeds that of ex-Muslim boys. This could be attributed to the added challenges imposed on their lives by Islam. Despite not believing in Allah, they must wear hijab almost constantly, even inside their homes, to avoid arousing male family members. Leaving the house requires the company of brothers or fathers, significantly limiting their freedom compared to ex-Muslim boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This fact is confirmed by thousands of stories of ex-Muslims in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/&quot;&gt;ex-Muslim subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, where the number of ex-Muslim girls far exceeds that of ex-Muslim boys, and they endure more suffering compared to boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Another burden they face is the inability to educate their own children about the issues with Islam.  Their male children are circumcised, and they are compelled to send their children to Quran Schools. This is perhaps the most depressing matter for an ex-Muslim parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plight of ex-Muslim individuals needs to be brought to the world's attention. Currently, many people are unaware of what it means to be an ex-Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Overall, the plight of ex-Muslim individuals needs greater awareness and understanding in society. They face unique challenges and deserve support and empathy to navigate their journey outside of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists Have No Right to Criticize Islam After Reading Just Four Books&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we reply to Islamists that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly: Disputes are not resolved based on the amount of knowledge someone possesses but rather on the ability to understand and evaluate arguments and evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In courts, decisions are not made by determining which side has a more knowledgeable lawyer. Instead, justice is achieved when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge can understand and assess the strength of the arguments presented by both sides, even if they were unfamiliar with the case before the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weighing these arguments and evidence, the judge decides which side has a stronger case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when people analyse a particular issue, they can evaluate arguments and evidence from both sides without needing to understand every other detail. For example, they don’t need to know 99.99% of Islam to form a judgment on one specific issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly: LOGIC and Common Sense are enough to reject Islam entirely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not necessary to disprove &lt;strong&gt;EVERY&lt;/strong&gt; aspect of Islam to justify leaving it. If a &lt;strong&gt;Single Fundamental&lt;/strong&gt; claim of Islam is shown to be flawed, logic and common sense alone can lead to rejecting the remaining 99% of Islam without further scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, Islam asserts that Allah is absolutely 100% perfect and incapable of making even a &lt;strong&gt;single error&lt;/strong&gt;. However, if it can be demonstrated that the Quran contains even one scientific mistake, this &lt;strong&gt;single error&lt;/strong&gt; is then sufficient to reject the entirety of Islam. Such reasoning is grounded in logic and basic common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is straightforward: One does not require a PhD degree to enter Islam or to criticize or to leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lastly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suggest that Islamic preachers first examine Islam thoroughly before raising objections against others. Let's consider whether Muhammad himself ever read even four books. What about his thousands of companions? Did they even read a single book? In fact, the Jews of that time were likely more educated than Muhammad and his illiterate companions. However, Muhammad justified his lower level of knowledge (and of his companions) by calling Jews &quot;donkeys&quot;, who are only carrying a load of books (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/62.5&quot;&gt;62:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ex-Muslim atheists have often delved into Islam far more extensively than just reading four books. They possess greater knowledge than non-Muslims who convert to Islam. Thus, these are only Double Standards of Islamists, where they are ok if a people convert to Islam without having any knowledge, but put a condition of PhD in order to leave it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/exMuslim_journey.png&quot; alt=&quot;exMuslim joureny to leave Islam&quot; width=&quot;437&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/exMuslim_journey.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Image courtesy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/haramdoodles/&quot;&gt;Haramdoodle.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The most painful and dangerous ride of our lives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) All ex-Muslims were also told as children to believe and fear eternal hellfire and punishment in the grave. Thus, doubting Islam or raising questions about any single Islamic ruling, immediately triggered that extreme fear of eternal hellfire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) All ex-Muslims were also told that Allah is 100% PERFECT and JUSTICE is one of his attributes. But when we come to know about injustices like the rape of captive and slave women against their consent, then it is one of the most painful shocks of our lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) All of us were aware that doubting Islam would mean our own family would turn against us, expel us from home and we would end up having no family. The fear of being shunned by family and friends, losing social support networks, and facing discrimination weigh extremely heavily on ex-Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) The process of reevaluating deeply held beliefs and ideologies can lead to a profound sense of &lt;strong&gt;identity crisis&lt;/strong&gt; and existential turmoil. Ex-Muslims struggle heavily with feelings of &lt;strong&gt;guilt, shame, and confusion&lt;/strong&gt; as they navigate their new worldview and sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) Leaving Islam also entails grappling with the loss of cultural and religious traditions that were once integral to one's identity. Ex-Muslims experience a profound sense of grief and disconnection from their cultural heritage, as well as the loss of rituals, customs, and communal practices that provided a &lt;strong&gt;sense of belonging&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(7) Ex-Muslims face heightened risks of persecution, discrimination, and violence in societies where apostasy is punishable by law or where blasphemy is vigorously enforced. The threat of legal prosecution, imprisonment, or even death can cast a shadow over the decision to renounce Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(8) For many ex-Muslims, leaving Islam involves a complex process of deconstructing and challenging deeply ingrained beliefs about &lt;strong&gt;morality, spirituality, and the nature of existence&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these painful challenges and extreme dangers, ex-Muslims are driven by an innate sense of humanity and a commitment to intellectual honesty. The pursuit of truth compels them to challenge the beliefs and ideologies they once held sacred, even at great personal cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not an Immediate, but a Gradual Change in Distinct PHASES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change doesn't happen overnight; it takes a longer period of time and occurs &quot;gradually&quot; in distinct &quot;phases,&quot; often spanning many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one ex-Muslim described the phases during his journey in the following words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Grief &amp;amp; Emptiness&lt;/strong&gt; - feeling a profound sense of loss, confusion, and emptiness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Nihilism &amp;amp; Anger&lt;/strong&gt; - everything seems meaningless and pointless, anger at myself for being fooled and anger at Islam and the horrible things in it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Cynicism &amp;amp; Individualism&lt;/strong&gt; - shoring up my sense of identity after having it shattered when I “uninstalled” Islam from my operating system and regaining a sense of self, figuring out how to navigate society without betraying myself and making sure my needs are met, struggling to maintain empathy and compassion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Gratitude &amp;amp; Freedom&lt;/strong&gt; - realizing I have an entire universe of meaning to draw from, without limit, to construct my sense of self, my understanding of reality (world view), and my relationship with reality, deep gratitude for my freedom and the ability to experience expanded consciousness and opportunity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Allegation by Islamists: Ex-Muslims leave Islam for money, fame, activism, or a career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the claims of Islamic apologists, the reality for millions of ex-Muslims, the vast majority of whom reside in Islamic countries, is one of constant fear and persecution. Forced into hiding to evade apostasy and blasphemy laws, as well as the threats posed by extremist religious adherents and even their own families, these individuals live in a perpetual state of vulnerability. In such circumstances, it is implausible to suggest that leaving Islam could bring them any monetary gain, fame, or career advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in Western nations, where ex-Muslims may theoretically enjoy greater freedoms, many still choose to conceal their apostasy to avoid risking their familial relationships. The number of openly ex-Muslims is a mere fraction of the total population, with only a small percentage—likely between 2% to 5%—willing to publicly declare their departure from Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While money, fame, and career opportunities are indeed valued pursuits for individuals worldwide, the vast majority of ex-Muslims do not leverage their apostasy for personal gain. In reality, only a minuscule portion—perhaps 1% —of openly ex-Muslims actively pursue such avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the crucial question: what about the remaining 99% of ex-Muslims who do not use their apostasy for any financial or career-related purposes? Their experiences underscore the profound challenges and sacrifices faced by those who dare to question and leave their former faith, highlighting the inherent injustice and hardship inherent in their struggle for freedom of belief and expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allegation by Islamists: Ex-Muslims leave Islam for their sinful lifestyle like Girlfriends/Partying/Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's then a puzzling question why millions of Muslims in countries such as Tunisia, Iraq, Turkey, and Algeria react with intense anger and vigorously defend their prophet and scripture when faced with criticism or mockery. This fervent reaction persists despite the prevalence of activities like nightclubbing, pre-marital dating, modern music, and even alcohol consumption in these societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Western countries, too, Muslim youth are involved in all these Haram activities, but still, they never eat pork and they stay Muslim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, enjoying, partying and dancing are integral parts of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Islam puts restrictions on opposite genders interacting with each other, then Islam is going against human nature. Due to this unnatural Islamic system, there is a huge problem of sexual frustration among Muslim youth in Islamic countries. That is why Islamic countries are at the top of the list for watching porno films. Please read our articles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=80&amp;amp;catid=12&quot;&gt;Are Islamic countries suffering from sexual frustration and ahead in watching Porn movies or is it only false propaganda?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allegation by Islamists: Ex-Muslims face a SINGLE bad experience in life, blame Allah for it, and leave Islam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't encountered a single ex-Muslim, where only a SINGLE incident was a reason for leaving Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All former Muslims are acutely aware of the injustices perpetrated by Islam against women. They are well-versed in how Islam encroaches upon women's rights in matters such as marriage, divorce (talaq), domestic violence, compulsory veiling (Hijab), confinement to the home, subservience to men, and the endorsement of polygamy and the exploitation of slave girls. All of them are appalled by the sanctioning of child marriage, where girls as young as six are wedded without their consent and subjected to sexual violence at the age of nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are those ex-Muslims who didn't know how Islam shows double standards where it wants rights for Muslims to preach Islam to non-Muslims and to convert them to Islam? But if non-Muslims preach their religion and if any Muslim leaves Islam, then Islam kills them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are those ex-Muslims who didn't know the clash between the &quot;Theory of Evolution&quot; and fantasy religious stories of the creation of Adam and Eve and how the devil made them eat the forbidden fruit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One single incident may be a trigger, but the injustices of Islam are many and all ex-Muslims were aware of them, and all these doubts played a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Muslims fail to see these Islamic injustices, then it is their own problem and they are suffering from religious indoctrination. They should cure their own disease instead of blaming ex-Muslims wrongfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the problem with Islam is, that it claims that Allah is 100% PERFECT. Thus, even if there is a SINGLE mistake found in Islam, then it destroys the remaining 99.99% of Islam automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, allows Muslim men to rape poor captive/slave women without their consent and even make all children slaves for their entire lives (although they had no role in wars), our innate sense of humanity unequivocally tells us that it is morally wrong. We cannot cherry-pick, accepting Allah as a deity in the majority of cases while denouncing him as oppressive only in instances like the rape of slave women. It's a binary choice: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;either Allah is divine in all matters, or he is not divine at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the claims of Islamic apologists, the reality for millions of ex-Muslims, the vast majority of whom reside in Islamic countries, is one of constant fear and persecution. Forced into hiding to evade apostasy and blasphemy laws, as well as the threats posed by extremist religious adherents and even their own families, these individuals live in a perpetual state of vulnerability. In such circumstances, it is implausible to suggest that leaving Islam could bring them any monetary gain, fame, or career advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in Western nations, where ex-Muslims may theoretically enjoy greater freedoms, many still choose to conceal their apostasy to avoid risking their familial relationships. The number of openly ex-Muslims is a mere fraction of the total population, with only a small percentage—likely between 2% to 5%—willing to publicly declare their departure from Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While money, fame, and career opportunities are indeed valued pursuits for individuals worldwide, the vast majority of ex-Muslims do not leverage their apostasy for personal gain. In reality, only a minuscule portion—perhaps 1% —of openly ex-Muslims actively pursue such avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the crucial question: what about the remaining 99% of ex-Muslims who do not use their apostasy for any financial or career-related purposes? Their experiences underscore the profound challenges and sacrifices faced by those who dare to question and leave their former faith, highlighting the inherent injustice and hardship inherent in their struggle for freedom of belief and expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allegation by Islamists: Ex-Muslims leave Islam for their sinful lifestyle like Girlfriends/Partying/Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's then a puzzling question why millions of Muslims in countries such as Tunisia, Iraq, Turkey, and Algeria react with intense anger and vigorously defend their prophet and scripture when faced with criticism or mockery. This fervent reaction persists despite the prevalence of activities like nightclubbing, pre-marital dating, modern music, and even alcohol consumption in these societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Western countries, too, Muslim youth are involved in all these Haram activities, but still, they never eat pork and they stay Muslim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, enjoying, partying and dancing are integral parts of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Islam puts restrictions on opposite genders interacting with each other, then Islam is going against human nature. Due to this unnatural Islamic system, there is a huge problem of sexual frustration among Muslim youth in Islamic countries. That is why Islamic countries are at the top of the list for watching porno films. Please read our articles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=80&amp;amp;catid=12&quot;&gt;Are Islamic countries suffering from sexual frustration and ahead in watching Porn movies or is it only false propaganda?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allegation by Islamists: Ex-Muslims face a SINGLE bad experience in life, blame Allah for it, and leave Islam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't encountered a single ex-Muslim, where only a SINGLE incident was a reason for leaving Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All former Muslims are acutely aware of the injustices perpetrated by Islam against women. They are well-versed in how Islam encroaches upon women's rights in matters such as marriage, divorce (talaq), domestic violence, compulsory veiling (Hijab), confinement to the home, subservience to men, and the endorsement of polygamy and the exploitation of slave girls. All of them are appalled by the sanctioning of child marriage, where girls as young as six are wedded without their consent and subjected to sexual violence at the age of nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are those ex-Muslims who didn't know how Islam shows double standards where it wants rights for Muslims to preach Islam to non-Muslims and to convert them to Islam? But if non-Muslims preach their religion and if any Muslim leaves Islam, then Islam kills them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are those ex-Muslims who didn't know the clash between the &quot;Theory of Evolution&quot; and fantasy religious stories of the creation of Adam and Eve and how the devil made them eat the forbidden fruit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One single incident may be a trigger, but the injustices of Islam are many and all ex-Muslims were aware of them, and all these doubts played a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Muslims fail to see these Islamic injustices, then it is their own problem and they are suffering from religious indoctrination. They should cure their own disease instead of blaming ex-Muslims wrongfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the problem with Islam is, that it claims that Allah is 100% PERFECT. Thus, even if there is a SINGLE mistake found in Islam, then it destroys the remaining 99.99% of Islam automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, allows Muslim men to rape poor captive/slave women without their consent and even make all children slaves for their entire lives (although they had no role in wars), our innate sense of humanity unequivocally tells us that it is morally wrong. We cannot cherry-pick, accepting Allah as a deity in the majority of cases while denouncing him as oppressive only in instances like the rape of slave women. It's a binary choice: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;either Allah is divine in all matters, or he is not divine at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ex-Muslims respond to this objection by pointing out that Muslims assert their right to reject all false deities before acknowledging Allah (i.e., لأ إله إلا الله There is no god but Allah). Then, what's wrong with us exercising our right to renounce Islam first by identifying as ex-Muslims?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even if we call ourselves Christian or Hindu or atheist, do Islam and Muslims admit it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, absolutely not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islam/Muslims don't consider us like other non-Muslims and don't call us Christian/Hindu/Atheist, but they call us Murtad (Apostates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All non-Muslim minorities get registration as Christian/Hindu/Jew/Nones etc. But the Islamic countries don't register us (i.e. ex-Muslims) as Christian/Hindu/Atheists. Instead of that, they register us Murtads (apostates) and file a crime charge against us, imprison us and then kill us. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even in the Western countries, where they cannot kill us, still they don't consider us like other Christians/Jews, but they always consider us Murtads. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see this difference between a normal Christian/Jew/Hindu and an ex-Muslim turned Christian/Jew/Hindu?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Islam refers to us with the abusive terminology of Murtad (i.e. An Islamic Apostate), Islamic preachers happily accept this abusive terminology for us. But when we label ourselves ex-Muslims, it becomes an issue for Islamic preachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they want us to leave the terminology of ex-Muslim, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, Muslims have to stop the use of the abusive Quranic terminology of Murtad. Murtad does not mean &quot;apostate&quot;, but it means &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;an Islamic apostate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. Islam/Muslims have no problem with normal apostasy like if any non-Muslim apostates from his/her religion and converts to Islam. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, Muslims have to agree that the usage of the word &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Murtad &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;is a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRIME against humanity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, just like the use of the &quot;N&quot; word. Yes, the word Murtad is a bigger derogatory term than the &quot;N&quot; word, and it also brings more HATRED and HARM to innocent people than the &quot;N&quot; word. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Muslims start considering us like other non-Muslim Christians/Jews/Atheists, only then they can demand us to stop calling ourselves ex-Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the reality is that we leave Islam, &lt;strong&gt;but Islam never leaves us&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is Islam that is &lt;strong&gt;obsessed &lt;/strong&gt;with us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;challenge &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Muslims to prove us otherwise i.e. Islam does leave us and Islam is not obsessed with us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's our fundamental human right to select whatever terminology we believe best represents us. We will never leave using its usage while it is helping us to fight back us Islamic Oppression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives an individual a feeling that he/she is not alone in rebelling against the religion of Islam, but there is a whole community of people who have done so. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ex-Muslims are arguably the most persecuted religious community on earth at present. They are often lonely individuals who must conceal their beliefs and live in fear throughout their lives. They cannot share their secrets with their Muslim families or even their children, as there is a risk that innocent children may reveal their secrets to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They feel obligated to raise their children as Muslims, despite considering Islam to be a false religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The usage of the term ex-Muslims serves as the most effective means of bringing awareness to the existence of these oppressed individuals who have abandoned Islam. This terminology helps highlight their struggles, hardships, and suffering to the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thus the term ex-Muslim is self-descriptive and can open the eyes of people who are kept in the dark, those who say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;- I didn't even know you could be an Ex-Muslim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It's a name that passively fights against Islamic propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim preachers ask: &quot;If there exist ex-Jews, ex-Hindus, ex-Christians, ex-Buddhists? If not, why then ex-Muslims?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ex-Muslims challenge these Muslim preachers to show them where any other religion (except for Islam) is &lt;strong&gt;obsessed &lt;/strong&gt;with people who leave the religion, abuse them with terminology like &quot;mulhid&quot;, and kill them in the name of &quot;murtad&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) No Advanced Qualifications are Required to Join or Leave Islam:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become Muslim or to leave Islam, you don't need a PhD or any advanced degrees. Having a basic understanding of the reasons for or against Islam is enough to make a personal decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when non-Muslims convert to Islam, they often do so without deep academic study. Their knowledge of Islam is far inferior compared to that of ex-Muslims. Yet, it's acceptable for Muslim preachers when these new converts embrace Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when ex-Muslims, who often possess a deeper understanding of Islam, choose to leave the religion, there's suddenly a demand for high-level expertise as justification. This shift in standards are nothing else than Double Standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It raises the question: Why is basic knowledge acceptable for joining Islam, but leaving it requires expert-level credentials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) We don't need to be experts on the entirety of Islam, but a single inconsistency or injustice attributed to a supposedly perfect deity is enough to raise questions about the faith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Islamic claim, Allah is 100% Perfect and can never commit a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, if it is proven that there exist even a SINGLE flaw or mistake by Allah, then the rest 99.99% of Islam will be automatically proven wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quranic story about the CREATION goes completely against the scientific Theory of Evolution. The Quran has no chance against science. It is not needed to waste time any more, and this single Quranic mistake is enough to leave the rest 99.99% of Islam too. And there are so many Scientific Blunders present in the Quran. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, the issue of &quot;Slavery and Sex Slavery&quot; is alone enough to leave Islam, while it become proven after it that Allah is UNJUST, and an unjust entity can never be a GOD. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even today, in the era of mass communication, hardly 0.000001% of people convert to Islam. This means, the rest of 99.999999% of innocent people, who by Allah's DESIGN take birth in non-Muslim families, will become fuel of eternal hellfire, despite their good deeds for humanity. This again proves that Islamic god (i.e. Allah) is UNJUST. And an unjust entity can never be a GOD. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) It's Not Just About Knowledge; It's About Doing &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Justice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Islamic teaching, Satan is considered highly knowledgeable—so knowledgeable that no Islamic scholar can surpass him. However, despite his vast knowledge, Satan is believed to have gone astray because he failed to do justice with the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Muslims don't necessarily claim to be more knowledgeable about Islam than Islamic scholars. What they do claim, however, is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islamic scholars are deeply indoctrinated by religious teachings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This indoctrination leads to blindness. The evidence that Islam is flawed is right in front of them, but rather than using their knowledge to seek truth and do justice, they focus all their energy on defending falsehood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(4) The Decision Isn't Based on Knowledge, But on Arguments and Proofs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a court of law, the outcome of a dispute isn't determined by which lawyer has more knowledge. Instead, it's based on the &quot;Arguments and Proofs&quot; presented by the lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Quran does not suggest that knowledge alone is the standard for determining what is right or wrong. Instead, it challenges skeptics with the words: &quot;Bring your &lt;strong&gt;proof &lt;/strong&gt;if you are truthful.&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quran.com/2/111?translations=84,17,26,101,20,85,18,95,19,22,52&quot;&gt;2:11&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ex-Muslims, our decision to leave Islam was based on &quot;Arguments and Proof.&quot; If Muslims wish to bring us back to Islam, they must convince us with compelling arguments and solid proofs. Simply criticizing us for not being as well-versed in Islamic studies as their scholars won't achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;(5) Ex-Muslims Have Greater Insight into Islam's Dark Side than Average Muslims:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we don't claim having a PhD degree about Islam, but we still believe that, on average, ex-Muslims have a deeper understanding of Islam compared to typical Muslims, particularly when it comes to recognizing the darker aspects of the religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic scholars have created an isolated environment where only one-sided, favourable information about Islam is shared. They highlight the positive aspects while completely suppressing any criticism that could shed light on the darker sides of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any criticism of Islam is immediately branded as blasphemy, leading to harsh consequences such as imprisonment or even killing those who dare to criticize Islam. This Muslim behaviour is a great injustice. Muslim communities must be ashamed of themselves for committing these crimes against humanity. Not even the polytheist pagans did so much ZULM upon Muhammad. Muslim communities are far ahead in committing this ZULM against non-Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we also do believe that ex-Muslims, on average, have a higher IQ than their Muslim counterparts. Most ex-Muslims are atheists, and studies suggest that atheists generally exhibit higher IQ levels compared to religious groups. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religiosity_and_intelligence&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It raises the question: Why is basic knowledge acceptable for joining Islam, but leaving it requires expert-level credentials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) We don't need to be experts on the entirety of Islam, but a single inconsistency or injustice attributed to a supposedly perfect deity is enough to raise questions about the faith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Islamic claim, Allah is 100% Perfect and can never commit a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, if it is proven that there exist even a SINGLE flaw or mistake by Allah, then the rest 99.99% of Islam will be automatically proven wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quranic story about the CREATION goes completely against the scientific Theory of Evolution. The Quran has no chance against science. It is not needed to waste time any more, and this single Quranic mistake is enough to leave the rest 99.99% of Islam too. And there are so many Scientific Blunders present in the Quran. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, the issue of &quot;Slavery and Sex Slavery&quot; is alone enough to leave Islam, while it become proven after it that Allah is UNJUST, and an unjust entity can never be a GOD. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even today, in the era of mass communication, hardly 0.000001% of people convert to Islam. This means, the rest of 99.999999% of innocent people, who by Allah's DESIGN take birth in non-Muslim families, will become fuel of eternal hellfire, despite their good deeds for humanity. This again proves that Islamic god (i.e. Allah) is UNJUST. And an unjust entity can never be a GOD. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) It's Not Just About Knowledge; It's About Doing &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Justice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Islamic teaching, Satan is considered highly knowledgeable—so knowledgeable that no Islamic scholar can surpass him. However, despite his vast knowledge, Satan is believed to have gone astray because he failed to do justice with the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Muslims don't necessarily claim to be more knowledgeable about Islam than Islamic scholars. What they do claim, however, is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islamic scholars are deeply indoctrinated by religious teachings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This indoctrination leads to blindness. The evidence that Islam is flawed is right in front of them, but rather than using their knowledge to seek truth and do justice, they focus all their energy on defending falsehood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(4) The Decision Isn't Based on Knowledge, But on Arguments and Proofs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a court of law, the outcome of a dispute isn't determined by which lawyer has more knowledge. Instead, it's based on the &quot;Arguments and Proofs&quot; presented by the lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Quran does not suggest that knowledge alone is the standard for determining what is right or wrong. Instead, it challenges skeptics with the words: &quot;Bring your &lt;strong&gt;proof &lt;/strong&gt;if you are truthful.&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quran.com/2/111?translations=84,17,26,101,20,85,18,95,19,22,52&quot;&gt;2:11&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ex-Muslims, our decision to leave Islam was based on &quot;Arguments and Proof.&quot; If Muslims wish to bring us back to Islam, they must convince us with compelling arguments and solid proofs. Simply criticizing us for not being as well-versed in Islamic studies as their scholars won't achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;(5) Ex-Muslims Have Greater Insight into Islam's Dark Side than Average Muslims:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we don't claim having a PhD degree about Islam, but we still believe that, on average, ex-Muslims have a deeper understanding of Islam compared to typical Muslims, particularly when it comes to recognizing the darker aspects of the religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic scholars have created an isolated environment where only one-sided, favourable information about Islam is shared. They highlight the positive aspects while completely suppressing any criticism that could shed light on the darker sides of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any criticism of Islam is immediately branded as blasphemy, leading to harsh consequences such as imprisonment or even killing those who dare to criticize Islam. This Muslim behaviour is a great injustice. Muslim communities must be ashamed of themselves for committing these crimes against humanity. Not even the polytheist pagans did so much ZULM upon Muhammad. Muslim communities are far ahead in committing this ZULM against non-Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we also do believe that ex-Muslims, on average, have a higher IQ than their Muslim counterparts. Most ex-Muslims are atheists, and studies suggest that atheists generally exhibit higher IQ levels compared to religious groups. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religiosity_and_intelligence&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello. Upon request, I've been asked to turn a comment I made into a post so that it can be a resource for more people. This post is a collection of advice I've given out about how to handle your life as a closeted exmuslim and how you'll come out in the future. It is largely based on my experience but also from what I've seen from others in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you've left Islam. You've delved through arguments, the apologetics and the bullshit and you've come to the conclusion that you no longer believe in Islam. And you may have also reached an alternative philosophical outlook on life that you can believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what now? You may have left Islam, but have you left the Muslim world? One of the most common misconceptions outsiders have is that since exmuslims are no longer Muslims, they no longer live in the Muslim world. This is painfully naive - in reality many exmuslims are closeted due to young age and financial dependency and/or live in Islamist countries or societies that enforce Islamic values. In fear of social stigma or even violence, exmuslims have to contend with closeted lives even after leaving Islam. So how do you deal with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time to come out to family is in your own home, over a dinner you paid for, alongside people who support you. That takes a lot of preparation and it means doing what you can to live your life as best as you can whilst working towards independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This basically means that a lot of what helps you come out of the closet will depend heavily on how well you prepared for it, so you will need to make the most of your closeted life. You may not be able to stop the shitstorm but you can at least prepare yourself to weather it. Here are some tips to achieve that goal (in no particular order)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;1) Don't meander in life due to a lack of decision making skills.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the worst mistakes I made was not realise I was an exmuslim sooner. As a result I had barely any time to prepare for when the inevitable happened and I was forced to come out. I spent a lot of my life meandering, trying to reconcile the irreconcilable, and trying to be a Muslim when I knew my values didn't align with it. I didn't really have much of a concept of exmuslims, but if I had been smarter I would have figured it out. I now tell people in a similar position that it's fine to take your time but don't take too long. Half arsing two very different cultures will leave you a loser in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly whilst planning for independence can be scary, don’t let it frighten you into inaction. The following is a passage from &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a
  
  
  
  
  hover:underline
  &quot; href=&quot;https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-make-a-tough-decision-break-it-down-and-listen-to-your-gut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about decision making:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research from the 1990s led by the US psychologist Thomas Gilovich provides further evidence for why it can be shortsighted to kick a difficult decision down the road. Gilovich and his team showed that although, in the short term, people experience more regret from ‘errors of commission’ (taking an action that leads to a disappointing outcome), in the long term it is actually ‘errors of omission’ that lead to more regret – that is, disappointing outcomes that arise from not taking an action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taking the time to make decisions and plans, don’t underestimate how effective it can be to map out your options on an excel spreadsheet. When I had to decide whether I should come out or not, I actually made a spreadsheet listing out my options, what they would result in and what the impact would be. Actually having it written down to look at really put things into perspective. We waste a lot of our time keeping it in our heads, which forces us to recalculate everything from scratch every time we revisit our thoughts. But the more that is mapped out, the less you have to recalculate and the more you can focus on evaluation and further planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;2) Study, career and finances.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your studies/career is almost always your best ticket out of your toxic situation, and the one thing to prioritise the most. If you’re young, do whatever you can to ensure that you can get into further education away from home. Even if it means spending all your time at a local library. If you suspect that your parents would be against you going to a university away from home, aim for a placement at the most prestigious university you can aim for so your parents would look worse for rejecting it. The quickest and most effective way in achieving long term independence is through good studies/career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;3) Do not telegraph irreligiosity whilst being closeted.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important for younger exmuslims because they telegraph to their parents in ways they would just not understand until they see it for themselves when they're older. Try your best to meet the religious obligations expected from your family. The more you slip, the more they will monitor you and the more difficult it will be to do the things you need to do discreetly when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for girls, this usually means that wearing the hijab is a necessity and it’s inadvisable to try and get out of. (However, that subject matter is not my forte: prioritise advice from exmuslim women such as from faithlesshijabi.org)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 100.015%;&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 99.9147%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 237); border: 1px solid rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Your Safety is your utmost Duty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Please regularly remind yourself of these suggestions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;You are fully capable of faking prayers and fasting etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;You are fully capable of living a double life until the right time comes for your escape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Your safety is your utmost duty, and you must never forget it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Make a 5, 10, or 15-year plan for your escape. Gather information and make reliable ex-Muslim (or non-Muslim) friends in different countries who can help you in an emergency. Find emergency shelters in your country. Get your passport ready. Always have a visa for countries like Sri Lanka or others where you can immediately seek asylum. As a Saudi citizen, you can also get visas for EU countries, and seeking asylum there is a much better choice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Gather all information and proofs, including older posts, to show that you are an ex-Muslim. Record any fights or arguments with your mother/family as proof of leaving Islam and evidence of danger to your life. Document everything on your mobile phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;4) Sometimes you may need to go above and beyond.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get the impression that your family is beginning to catch onto your apostasy then it's likely that they have and you may need to reverse that impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to do that would be to start getting books on Islam and not just for show. My advice would be to get books on Islamic history because that's the least boring stuff. Or better yet, just get whatever unapologetic salafi hate crime you can get your hands on so you can entertain yourself with how fucked up it is. Or get an annotated Qur'an like the Study Qur'an. Do something to ease their suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What book you get depends on what kind of message you want to telegraph to your parents. If you want to telegraph a message then it will need to be a paper book and not an e-book. Something that you can lay around in your room and that you know they'll see. That means you're restricted to what you can get from your local library or Masjid. Also depends on what interests you because you'll have to actually read and demonstrate you learnt from it if you want send the best message you can. If you want purely what Muslims write about Islamic history, you can check out works like The Sealed Nectar or works by &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a

If you want something a little more academic, but not something that would rouse suspicion then check out university press works like &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a

&lt;p&gt;But you may find that your best bet is to just see what your local Masjid might have and see what tickles your fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;5) Actually coming out is usually a shitstorm.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for lots of sobbing, guilt tripping and an inability to respect your beliefs and boundaries. Learn techniques like the Broken Record Technique to establish boundaries. Know what you have to say when they inevitably tell you to speak to a scholar - you don't have to eat the whole apple to know it's rotten. You know all that you need to know about Islam and you know even more about the world outside of Islam to put it into context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel yourself with months and months of your family sending you bad dawagandist videos through WhatsApp trying to bring you back. You may have to spend months beating their attempts and going to toe to toe with them without mercy before they’re finally willing to relent and get off your back. Even then don’t expect them to relent entirely. There will always be some micro aggressions that they will resort to, like playing religious videos loudly in your vicinity. The most you can do in those circumstances is reduce contact with them as much as possible. At this point you would hopefully already be independent from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;6) Do not feel guilt.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an exmuslim, you will go through a lot of guilt. Whilst this does show you are human, you need to forget about guilt: you are not responsible for your parents' failure to be reasonable, not even your mother. They take responsibility for the social stigma and oppressive life they choose to live in and perpetuate. You get &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; out of that guilt. It's completely pointless and ultimately counterproductive. You can't set yourself on fire to make others warm and you gain no recognition from martyrizing yourself. Do not feel guilt for what you have to do to have a completely reasonable life. The only ones to blame are those who forced you into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't underestimate parents either. They will use guilt against you. Give them an inch and they will take a mile. They very often bring up their health problems as a weapon against you. Don't fall for it. It only affects them because they choose to let it affect them. They can choose to be reasonable. You have to respect their autonomy and let them deal with the consequences of their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;7) Don't come out too soon thinking it's a release.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come across a lot of exmuslim kids who think coming out will help explain to their religious parents why they don't want to wear the hijab or do other religious things. But the likelihood is more that those same parents will react extremely poorly and restrict your freedom even more, making it more difficult to achieve long term independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the mistake in assuming that coming out will lead to being disowned in the vain hope that you get an quick clean break that takes all the responsibility from you. For some exmuslims this does actually work out, but for a lot of others it's miscalculated. My family didn't disown me, I still had to deal with months of my family being insufferable manipulators and the responsibility was still on me to separate from them. And for women it can be much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you are financially dependent on your family then coming out early will very typically result in your family using that leverage against you and making your life worse. I've seen stories of exmuslims who thought their family was better and badly miscalculated - be mindful of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;8) Don’t panic too much if they find out.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some exmuslims get found out, sometimes because of a snitch in the family or sometimes because they just weren’t convincing enough. Don’t panic – Muslims can be pretty damn deluded about their faith and your family will want to believe that you can come back very easily because according to them Islam is just common sense and most disbelievers are just silly and ignorant. Try to do your best to convince them as per Point 4. If it’s because you did something haram, blasphemous or otherwise worthy of takfir, try to act like it was because you were a misguided Quranist or progressive Muslim. They will still retain suspicion but it’s still better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re at the point of no return and you know you can’t convince them then now is the time to make calls to any secular friends you have, ask for support and maybe even shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for Western exmuslims, make sure to act quickly if you suspect that your parents want to send you abroad and trap you in your country of ethnic origin. Sadly some parents will go to these lengths. Do not go, no matter the cost. Find organisations willing to advise, such as those listed in Point 10. Hide your passport if you have to. Note down the contact details of your embassy in that country just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;9) Go no contact if you fear abuse.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually think about whether it's even wise for you to come out in any circumstance. Do you suspect that there could be violence or abuse? If so then you have absolutely no need to go through this stupid bullshit. Leave and don't look back. If your parents couldn't give you safe environment to even come out about different beliefs then they are not worth the time. As per Point 6 - You have to respect their autonomy and let them deal with the consequences of their own ways. This is particularly pertinent for those who live in a predominantly Muslim countries. They have a very real reason to fear persecution and absolutely do not need to risk their own lives for the sake of their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;10) Make use of organisations and resources.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into secular organisations like recoveringfromreligion.org, faithlesshijabi.org and faithtofaithless.com. Look into women's charities in your area like womensaid.org.uk or karmanirvana.org.uk (UK examples). Look into LGBT charities like rainbowrailroad.org. If you have secular school counsellors and friends then talk to them. Get advice from adults you can absolutely trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: On the flip side don't take risks with people you can’t be sure of. You may be tempted to come out to your Muslim friend, but I've seen plenty of stories of exmuslims who heavily regret doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also informal exmuslim groups on other social media platforms such as Facebook or Discord, but be careful about how much information you share and especially be wary of private messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;11) You may have to leave the country.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly the case for exmuslims living in predominantly Muslim countries. Unfortunately, I don't have any real world experience to offer here but you may be able to find localised advice by digging around. For example sites like wearesaudis.net might have some information (but you'll need a VPN to access this one.

&lt;p&gt;Note: some exmuslims in Muslim countries fall for the doomscrolling hyperbole and think Europe is “doomed” with too many Muslims. They have a tendency of asking which country is best to migrate to as an exmuslim to avoid Islam. Please ignore the doomsayers and prioritise the country you choose based on ease of access and career opportunities. As long as it is a secular country, you can worry about avoiding Islam later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello. Upon request, I've been asked to turn a comment I made into a post so that it can be a resource for more people. This post is a collection of advice I've given out about how to handle your life as a closeted exmuslim and how you'll come out in the future. It is largely based on my experience but also from what I've seen from others in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you've left Islam. You've delved through arguments, the apologetics and the bullshit and you've come to the conclusion that you no longer believe in Islam. And you may have also reached an alternative philosophical outlook on life that you can believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what now? You may have left Islam, but have you left the Muslim world? One of the most common misconceptions outsiders have is that since exmuslims are no longer Muslims, they no longer live in the Muslim world. This is painfully naive - in reality many exmuslims are closeted due to young age and financial dependency and/or live in Islamist countries or societies that enforce Islamic values. In fear of social stigma or even violence, exmuslims have to contend with closeted lives even after leaving Islam. So how do you deal with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time to come out to family is in your own home, over a dinner you paid for, alongside people who support you. That takes a lot of preparation and it means doing what you can to live your life as best as you can whilst working towards independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This basically means that a lot of what helps you come out of the closet will depend heavily on how well you prepared for it, so you will need to make the most of your closeted life. You may not be able to stop the shitstorm but you can at least prepare yourself to weather it. Here are some tips to achieve that goal (in no particular order)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;1) Don't meander in life due to a lack of decision making skills.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the worst mistakes I made was not realise I was an exmuslim sooner. As a result I had barely any time to prepare for when the inevitable happened and I was forced to come out. I spent a lot of my life meandering, trying to reconcile the irreconcilable, and trying to be a Muslim when I knew my values didn't align with it. I didn't really have much of a concept of exmuslims, but if I had been smarter I would have figured it out. I now tell people in a similar position that it's fine to take your time but don't take too long. Half arsing two very different cultures will leave you a loser in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly whilst planning for independence can be scary, don’t let it frighten you into inaction. The following is a passage from &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a
  
  
  
  
  hover:underline
  &quot; href=&quot;https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-make-a-tough-decision-break-it-down-and-listen-to-your-gut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about decision making:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research from the 1990s led by the US psychologist Thomas Gilovich provides further evidence for why it can be shortsighted to kick a difficult decision down the road. Gilovich and his team showed that although, in the short term, people experience more regret from ‘errors of commission’ (taking an action that leads to a disappointing outcome), in the long term it is actually ‘errors of omission’ that lead to more regret – that is, disappointing outcomes that arise from not taking an action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taking the time to make decisions and plans, don’t underestimate how effective it can be to map out your options on an excel spreadsheet. When I had to decide whether I should come out or not, I actually made a spreadsheet listing out my options, what they would result in and what the impact would be. Actually having it written down to look at really put things into perspective. We waste a lot of our time keeping it in our heads, which forces us to recalculate everything from scratch every time we revisit our thoughts. But the more that is mapped out, the less you have to recalculate and the more you can focus on evaluation and further planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;2) Study, career and finances.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your studies/career is almost always your best ticket out of your toxic situation, and the one thing to prioritise the most. If you’re young, do whatever you can to ensure that you can get into further education away from home. Even if it means spending all your time at a local library. If you suspect that your parents would be against you going to a university away from home, aim for a placement at the most prestigious university you can aim for so your parents would look worse for rejecting it. The quickest and most effective way in achieving long term independence is through good studies/career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;3) Do not telegraph irreligiosity whilst being closeted.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important for younger exmuslims because they telegraph to their parents in ways they would just not understand until they see it for themselves when they're older. Try your best to meet the religious obligations expected from your family. The more you slip, the more they will monitor you and the more difficult it will be to do the things you need to do discreetly when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for girls, this usually means that wearing the hijab is a necessity and it’s inadvisable to try and get out of. (However, that subject matter is not my forte: prioritise advice from exmuslim women such as from faithlesshijabi.org)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;You are fully capable of living a double life until the right time comes for your escape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Your safety is your utmost duty, and you must never forget it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Make a 5, 10, or 15-year plan for your escape. Gather information and make reliable ex-Muslim (or non-Muslim) friends in different countries who can help you in an emergency. Find emergency shelters in your country. Get your passport ready. Always have a visa for countries like Sri Lanka or others where you can immediately seek asylum. As a Saudi citizen, you can also get visas for EU countries, and seeking asylum there is a much better choice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Gather all information and proofs, including older posts, to show that you are an ex-Muslim. Record any fights or arguments with your mother/family as proof of leaving Islam and evidence of danger to your life. Document everything on your mobile phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;4) Sometimes you may need to go above and beyond.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get the impression that your family is beginning to catch onto your apostasy then it's likely that they have and you may need to reverse that impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to do that would be to start getting books on Islam and not just for show. My advice would be to get books on Islamic history because that's the least boring stuff. Or better yet, just get whatever unapologetic salafi hate crime you can get your hands on so you can entertain yourself with how fucked up it is. Or get an annotated Qur'an like the Study Qur'an. Do something to ease their suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What book you get depends on what kind of message you want to telegraph to your parents. If you want to telegraph a message then it will need to be a paper book and not an e-book. Something that you can lay around in your room and that you know they'll see. That means you're restricted to what you can get from your local library or Masjid. Also depends on what interests you because you'll have to actually read and demonstrate you learnt from it if you want send the best message you can. If you want purely what Muslims write about Islamic history, you can check out works like The Sealed Nectar or works by &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a

&lt;p&gt;But you may find that your best bet is to just see what your local Masjid might have and see what tickles your fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;5) Actually coming out is usually a shitstorm.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for lots of sobbing, guilt tripping and an inability to respect your beliefs and boundaries. Learn techniques like the Broken Record Technique to establish boundaries. Know what you have to say when they inevitably tell you to speak to a scholar - you don't have to eat the whole apple to know it's rotten. You know all that you need to know about Islam and you know even more about the world outside of Islam to put it into context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel yourself with months and months of your family sending you bad dawagandist videos through WhatsApp trying to bring you back. You may have to spend months beating their attempts and going to toe to toe with them without mercy before they’re finally willing to relent and get off your back. Even then don’t expect them to relent entirely. There will always be some micro aggressions that they will resort to, like playing religious videos loudly in your vicinity. The most you can do in those circumstances is reduce contact with them as much as possible. At this point you would hopefully already be independent from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;6) Do not feel guilt.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an exmuslim, you will go through a lot of guilt. Whilst this does show you are human, you need to forget about guilt: you are not responsible for your parents' failure to be reasonable, not even your mother. They take responsibility for the social stigma and oppressive life they choose to live in and perpetuate. You get &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; out of that guilt. It's completely pointless and ultimately counterproductive. You can't set yourself on fire to make others warm and you gain no recognition from martyrizing yourself. Do not feel guilt for what you have to do to have a completely reasonable life. The only ones to blame are those who forced you into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't underestimate parents either. They will use guilt against you. Give them an inch and they will take a mile. They very often bring up their health problems as a weapon against you. Don't fall for it. It only affects them because they choose to let it affect them. They can choose to be reasonable. You have to respect their autonomy and let them deal with the consequences of their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;7) Don't come out too soon thinking it's a release.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come across a lot of exmuslim kids who think coming out will help explain to their religious parents why they don't want to wear the hijab or do other religious things. But the likelihood is more that those same parents will react extremely poorly and restrict your freedom even more, making it more difficult to achieve long term independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the mistake in assuming that coming out will lead to being disowned in the vain hope that you get an quick clean break that takes all the responsibility from you. For some exmuslims this does actually work out, but for a lot of others it's miscalculated. My family didn't disown me, I still had to deal with months of my family being insufferable manipulators and the responsibility was still on me to separate from them. And for women it can be much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you are financially dependent on your family then coming out early will very typically result in your family using that leverage against you and making your life worse. I've seen stories of exmuslims who thought their family was better and badly miscalculated - be mindful of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;8) Don’t panic too much if they find out.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some exmuslims get found out, sometimes because of a snitch in the family or sometimes because they just weren’t convincing enough. Don’t panic – Muslims can be pretty damn deluded about their faith and your family will want to believe that you can come back very easily because according to them Islam is just common sense and most disbelievers are just silly and ignorant. Try to do your best to convince them as per Point 4. If it’s because you did something haram, blasphemous or otherwise worthy of takfir, try to act like it was because you were a misguided Quranist or progressive Muslim. They will still retain suspicion but it’s still better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re at the point of no return and you know you can’t convince them then now is the time to make calls to any secular friends you have, ask for support and maybe even shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for Western exmuslims, make sure to act quickly if you suspect that your parents want to send you abroad and trap you in your country of ethnic origin. Sadly some parents will go to these lengths. Do not go, no matter the cost. Find organisations willing to advise, such as those listed in Point 10. Hide your passport if you have to. Note down the contact details of your embassy in that country just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;9) Go no contact if you fear abuse.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually think about whether it's even wise for you to come out in any circumstance. Do you suspect that there could be violence or abuse? If so then you have absolutely no need to go through this stupid bullshit. Leave and don't look back. If your parents couldn't give you safe environment to even come out about different beliefs then they are not worth the time. As per Point 6 - You have to respect their autonomy and let them deal with the consequences of their own ways. This is particularly pertinent for those who live in a predominantly Muslim countries. They have a very real reason to fear persecution and absolutely do not need to risk their own lives for the sake of their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;10) Make use of organisations and resources.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into secular organisations like recoveringfromreligion.org, faithlesshijabi.org and faithtofaithless.com. Look into women's charities in your area like womensaid.org.uk or karmanirvana.org.uk (UK examples). Look into LGBT charities like rainbowrailroad.org. If you have secular school counsellors and friends then talk to them. Get advice from adults you can absolutely trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: On the flip side don't take risks with people you can’t be sure of. You may be tempted to come out to your Muslim friend, but I've seen plenty of stories of exmuslims who heavily regret doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also informal exmuslim groups on other social media platforms such as Facebook or Discord, but be careful about how much information you share and especially be wary of private messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;text-16 xs:text-18&quot;&gt;11) You may have to leave the country.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly the case for exmuslims living in predominantly Muslim countries. Unfortunately, I don't have any real world experience to offer here but you may be able to find localised advice by digging around. For example sites like wearesaudis.net might have some information (but you'll need a VPN to access this one.

&lt;p&gt;Note: some exmuslims in Muslim countries fall for the doomscrolling hyperbole and think Europe is “doomed” with too many Muslims. They have a tendency of asking which country is best to migrate to as an exmuslim to avoid Islam. Please ignore the doomsayers and prioritise the country you choose based on ease of access and career opportunities. As long as it is a secular country, you can worry about avoiding Islam later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>The Quran contains many scientific errors regarding the nature of meteors, also known as shooting stars. According to the Quran:</p>
<ol>
<li>It describes the existence of seven heavens, with the lowest 1st heaven being closest to Earth.</li>
<li>The stars (which appear <strong>STATIC</strong> to us) are depicted as '<strong>burning</strong> <strong>lamps</strong>' as they are visible to us emitting light. They are placed under the lowest 1st heaven of the Earth to <strong>adorn</strong> it.</li>
<li>The Quran claims that these same stars  (which are static in their normal state and serve as lamps) transform into SHOOTING stars (i.e. meterors) when angels throw these static stars as missiles to attack the devils who try to listen to Allah's commandments in the first heaven.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, modern scientific knowledge contradicts this Quranic account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lamps like static stars don't turn into shooting stars. Stars are massive, self-luminous celestial bodies made of gas, emitting light and heat through nuclear fusion.</li>
<li>But the shooting stars are asteroids, which are rocky objects, primarily found between Mars and Jupiter in the asteroid belt.</li>
<li>These asteroids are not burning and emitting lights as '<strong>burning lamps</strong>'. And they are also not <strong>adorning</strong> the sky. No, but they are dark, and cold and totally invisible to our human eye. </li>
<li>When asteroids collide, they break into smaller fragments called meteoroids. When these meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere, they burn up due to friction and appear as meteors.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next clash between the Quran and science is that the author of the Quran was unaware of the existence of dark stars along with asteroids:</p>
<ul>
<li>In space, aside from burning stars like the sun, there are trillions of solid stars similar to our Earth, but they don't appear twinkling to us; rather, they are completely dark and invisible to the human eye.</li>
<li>Apart from burning stars like the sun, we can only see a few nearby planets, such as Mars and Jupiter, which twinkle because they reflect sunlight.</li>
<li>However, the trillions of stars that do not burn like the sun remain invisible to us, and they do not adorn the sky because their distance from Earth is so great that their reflected light cannot reach us.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the author of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad himself) had no knowledge of these trillions of dark stars, along with asteroids. Instead, according to the Quran, all stars in the sky are twinkling because Allah created all of them to adorn the world’s first heaven with their brightness.</p>

<p>Please see the following 2 verses:</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5">37:6-10</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>إِنَّا <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>زَيَّنَّا</strong></span> <span style="color: #1200ff;"><strong>ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا</strong></span> بِزِينَةٍ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ٱلْكَوَاكِبِ</strong></span> وَحِفْظًا مِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَٰنٍ مَّارِدٍ</p>
<p>Indeed, We have adorned (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>زَيَّنَّا</strong></span>) (lowest of 7 heavens, i.e.) the heaven of Earth (<span style="color: #1200ff;"><strong>ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا</strong></span>) with an adornment of stars (Arabic: Kawakib <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>كَوَاكِبِ</strong></span>). And (to) guard against every devil rebellious, [So] they may not listen to the exalted assembly [of angels] and are pelted from every side. Repelled; and for them is a constant punishment. <em><strong>Except one who snatches [some words] by theft, but they are pursued/chased by a burning flame</strong></em>, piercing [in brightness].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/67.5">67:5</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَلَقَدْ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>زَيَّنَّا</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #1200ff;">ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا</span></strong> بِمَصَٰبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَٰهَا رُجُومًا لِّلشَّيَٰطِينِ ۖ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلسَّعِيرِ</p>
<p>And certainly We have adorned (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>زَيَّنَّا</strong></span>) the <em><strong>Heaven of Earth</strong></em> <em>(i.e. the lowest heaven from among the 7 heaves, and which is closest to the Earth. Arabic:  السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا) <strong>with lamps </strong></em>(i.e. static stars) and We have made them (as) <em><strong>missiles</strong></em> for the <em><strong>devils.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quranic verses state that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Stars (which appear static to us) serve as beautiful lamps adorning the lowest heaven, closest to Earth.</li>
<li>These lamps (i.e. static stars) transformed into missile like "shooting stars", when used as missiles against the devils who attempt to eavesdrop on the heavenly assembly of angels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, according to these verses, Allah asserts that static looking stars are radiant lamps positioned by Him in the first heaven to enhance its beauty and, when required, become fiery projectiles to repel and punish rebellious devils seeking forbidden knowledge from the divine assembly.</p>
<p>The following Hadith also proves that these <em>shooting stars</em> are the same as <em>the static lamps like stars.</em></p>

<p>As we were sitting during the night with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), a meteor <em><strong>(Note: This is a Tehrif (distortion) in the English Translation, as Hadith did not use the word meteor, but <span style="color: #ff0000;">STAR بِنَجْمٍ</span>) </strong></em>gave a dazzling light. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: What did you say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shooting star? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: These shooting stars neither appear at the death of anyone nor on the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues <em><strong>Command</strong></em> when He decides to do a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of heaven who are near to them<strong> </strong><em>until this glory of God reaches them who are in the</em><strong> heaven of this world </strong><em>(i.e. the first and the lowest heaven, السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا)</em>. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches <strong><em>the (lowest) heaven of the world</em></strong>. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages to overhear and he carries it to his friends. <em><strong>And when the Angels see the jinn (devil) they attack them with the meteors (shooting stars)</strong></em>. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Therefore, in this hadith:</p>
<ul>
<li>The companions witnessed a star, which gave a dazzling light.</li>
<li>Muhammad affirmed to his companions that these celestial phenomena were, indeed, the burning flames employed to assail and chase the devils.</li>
<li>Moreover, Muhammad also confirmed in this hadith that the whole star نجم becomes a shooting star (i.e. meteor), which is a scientific mistake. </li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the following supporting Hadith establishes too that these whole stars turn into shooting stars (i.e. meteors)</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&idfrom=3030&idto=3030&bk_no=0&ID=2016">link 1 </a>and <a href="https://sunnah.com/mishkat:4602">link 2</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَعَن قتادةَ قَالَ: خلقَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى هَذِه <strong>النجومَ</strong> لثلاثٍ جَعَلَهَا زِينَةً لِلسَّمَاءِ وَرُجُومًا لِلشَّيَاطِينِ</p>
<p>Qatada said God most high created these (static looking) <strong>stars</strong> for three purposes; He made them an adornment for the sky, missiles for the devils, and signs by which people find their way.</p>

<p>Contrary to the Quranic assertion:</p>
<ul>
<li>The static looking stars, described as lamps in verse <a href="https://quranx.com/67.5">67:5</a>, are <strong>visible </strong>celestial bodies that adorn the first heaven. But these static stars do not transform into shooting stars as claimed by the Quran.</li>
<li>Instead, shooting stars, known as meteoroids, are small pebble-sized objects that ignite into burning flames only upon entering Earth's atmosphere.</li>
<li>Prior to their atmospheric entry, meteoroids do travel like missiles towards the earth due to its gravitational power, but without emitting any fire or light or flame.</li>
<li>They also don't serve as adornments for the sky; in fact, they remain dark and imperceptible to the naked eye.</li>
<li>Moreover, meteoroids do not possess the ability to guide people in finding their way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/15.16?context=3">15:16-18</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And We have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers. And We have protected it from every devil accursed. <em>Except one who steals a hearing and is <strong>chased</strong> away by <strong>a clear burning flame</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5">37:6-10</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, We have adorned (lowest of 7 heavens, i.e.) the heaven of Earth (Arabic:  السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا) with an adornment of stars. And (to) guard against every devil rebellious, [So] they may not listen to the exalted assembly [of angels] and are pelted from every side. Repelled; and for them is a constant punishment. <em>Except one who snatches [some words] by theft, but they are <strong>pursued</strong> by<strong> </strong>a burning flame</em>, piercing [in brightness].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If these Quranic verses are indeed accurate, then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, an angel must specifically aim at the devils while throwing the meteors towards them.</li>
<li>Secondly, pursuing or chasing an escaping devil like a missile also implies that the burning flame should have the ability to change its path.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the Quran is mistaken in this regard, as even meteors never alter their path. They solely follow the gravity of the earth and adhere to the laws of physics, travelling in a straight line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Up to 50 shooting stars an hour are expected to light up the night sky during the Eta Aquarid meteor shower. The dazzling display takes place between April 19 and May 28 but will peak this year on Friday (May 6) ... Experts at Royal Observatory Greenwich say the best time to catch a glimpse of the celestial display – which will be visible all over the world – will be between midnight and dawn on Friday ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, scientists can now predict in advance:</p>
<ol>
<li>The specific date and time when the devils will supposedly steal the so-called command of Allah from the 1st heaven.</li>
<li>They can also anticipate the "rate of stealing," i.e., how many devils will allegedly steal the commands of Allah per hour (up to 50 shooting stars an hour during the Eta Aquarid meteor shower).</li>
</ol>
<p>This implies that modern scientists seemingly possess knowledge of the future, paralleling Allah's omniscience.</p>
<p>We just hope that Muslims can realize how ridiculous the Quranic story about devils and shooting stars has become in the light of modern science.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM indexed"><span id="section-3rd-blunder-the-quran-implies-that-the-1st-heaven-of-earth-is-merely-62-miles-away-from-earth" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_text"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId807076"></a>3rd Blunder: The Quran implies that the 1st Heaven of Earth is merely 62 miles away from Earth</span></h2>
<p>According to the Quran, when devils attempt to eavesdrop on the assembly of angels to hear the commands of Allah, they are struck with shooting stars.</p>
<p>However, modern science has demonstrated that meteoroids only ignite upon entering Earth's atmosphere from space. Since space begins approximately 62 miles above Earth's surface, it suggests that the 1st Heaven is situated within this distance of 62 miles according to the Quran.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/72.8?context=2">72:8-9</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The Jinns said] We sought to <em><strong>touch the heaven</strong></em> but we found it filled (with) guards severe, and burning flames. And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider this: If scientists are not blind, they have not observed any solid heaven as the Quran and Ahadith claim, positioned only 62 miles away. Additionally, they have not witnessed the assembly of angels, nor have they seen Adam laughing and weeping, or the descendants of Adam there. Refer to the following Hadith:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:163">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 163</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ... Gabriel ascended with me to the heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven (i.e. the heaven of the earth), Gabriel said to the guardian of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied. It is Gabriel. He again asked who is there with you. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes. Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. <em>When he looked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept.</em> He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: <em>He is Adam (peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It casts doubt on the credibility of the Quran's writer, who narrated fictional tales to impress the people of that era when knowledge was limited, thinking no one could verify or refute his stories about shooting stars.</p>
<h2 class="indexed"><span id="section-4th-blunder-contradiction-in-the-quran-regarding-the-distance-of-the-1st-heaven" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_text"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId703226"></a>4th Blunder: Contradiction in the Quran regarding the distance of the 1st heaven</span></h2>
<p>On one hand, the Quran's writer claimed that shooting star incidents occur in the 1st heaven, implying that it is 62 miles away from Earth.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the same writer also asserted that all stars are positioned under the 1st heaven, placed by Allah to adorn this lowest heaven.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5">37:6</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, We (Allah) have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern science, however, has exposed this contradiction in the Quran, proving that stars are actually located billions of light-years away from Earth, which also then automatically mean that the 1st heaven is also billions of light years away from the Earth.</p>
<p>We urge Muslims to contemplate this apparent inconsistency in the Quran, if the 1st heave is 62 miles away, or billions of light years away. </p>

<p>This so-called Sahih Hadith presents an absurd account where Muhammad claims that devils ascend to the 1st heaven by forming a ladder of sorts, with the uppermost devil stealing the command of Allah and passing it down the chain to the lowest devil on Earth.</p>
<div class="text_details"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4800">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4800</a>:</div>
<div class="text_details">
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's Prophet said, "When Allah decrees some order in the heaven, the angels flutter their wings indicating complete surrender to His saying which sounds like chains being dragged on rock. And when the state of fear disappears, they ask each other, "What has your Lord ordered? They say that He has said that which is true and just, and He is the Most High, the Most Great." (34.23). <strong><em>Then the stealthy listeners (devils) hear this order, and these stealthy listeners are like this, one over the other [i.e. standing upon the shoulders of each other and making a ladder]." Sufyan, a sub-narrator demonstrated that by holding his hand upright and separating the fingers. A stealthy listener hears a word which he will convey to that which is below him and the second will convey it to that which is below him till the last of them will convey it to the wizard or foreteller.</em> <em>Sometimes a flame (fire) may strike the devil before he can convey it, and sometimes he may convey it before the flame (fire) strikes him</em></strong>, whereupon the wizard adds to that word a hundred lies. The people will then say, 'Didn't he (i.e. magician) tell such-and-such a thing on such-and-such date?' So that magician is said to have told the truth because of the Statement which has been heard from the heavens."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p> According to the Quran, the 1st heaven is located billions of light-years away from Earth, as all stars exist under the 1st heaven to beautify it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Muhammad's account states that devils can reach this faraway 1st heaven by merely standing on each other's shoulders.</p>
<p>It is highly implausible for any rational person in this modern scientific era to believe in such a ridiculous fairytale promoted by Muhammad.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Hadith becomes even more absurd when it claims that the missiles struck by Allah's orders sometimes miss their targets, allowing the devil to successfully hear and then pass on Allah's commands to the devil below him. But the question is h<span style="font-size: 1rem;">ow can infallible angels miss their target? </span></p>
<p>Apologists may argue that the Quran and Hadith are not books of science, but the question remains: Why do Allah and Muhammad present completely false scientific facts in them if they are not meant to be taken as scientific truths?</p>
<h2 class="indexed"><span id="section-6th-blunder-only-after-the-prophethood-of-muhammad-devils-were-started-to-be-hit-by-shooting-stars" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_text"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId812278"></a>6th Blunder: Only after the prophethood of Muhammad, devils were started to be hit by shooting stars</span></h2>
<p>It is important to understand why the writer of the Quran, who we believe to be Muhammad himself, fabricated the story of shooting stars and devils. It seems, there were 2 main reasons which compelled Muhammad to make this story: </p>
<p>Firstly, people were doubting Muhammad, as he claimed in the Quran that ONLY Allah knows UNSEEN. But then there was a contradiction in the Quran that soothsayers were able to tell Moses about the future unseen. </p>
<p>Secondly, despite claiming prophethood and receiving news of the future and the unseen from Allah, people still sought the services of soothsayers to inquire about the future, offering them money and sacrifices to gain knowledge about the future.</p>
<p>Muhammad desired to monopolize the domain of future knowledge and unseen events by discrediting soothsayers. To achieve this, he invented a narrative stating that soothsayers could indeed foretell the future in the past, as devils used to steal news, and then bring them news from the 1st heaven. However, after Muhammad's prophethood, this practice ceased, and Allah began to hit the devils with shooting stars whenever they tried to eavesdrop on His commands in the 1st heaven. Muhammad cited Quran 72:8-9 as evidence of this change.</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/72.8?context=2">72:8-9</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The Jinns said] We sought to <em><strong>touch the heaven</strong></em> but we found it filled (with) guards severe, and burning flames. And<em> <strong>we used to sit therein (in the past)</strong></em> in positions for hearing, but whoever listens <em><strong>now</strong></em> (i.e. after the prophethood of Muhammad) will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By crafting this story, Muhammad successfully undermined the significance of soothsayers and their ability to predict the future. However, this story created another issue. If shooting stars were not used for hitting the devils before Muhammad's prophethood, what purpose did the transformation of stars into burning flames (shooting stars) serve during that time?</p>
<p>Muhammad, or the writer of the Quran, never addressed this question during his lifetime, perhaps unable to provide a satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p>Later generations of Muslims were also unable to present any conclusive evidence to support this claim. Ibn Kathir attempted to provide an argument in his Tafsir (under verse 72:8), suggesting that incidents of shooting stars (meteors) occurred before Muhammad's prophethood, but they were infrequent  (<a href="http://www.quran4u.com/Tafsir%20Ibn%20Kathir/072%20Jinn.htm">Tafsir Ibn Kathir, under verse 72:8</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It used to be that shooting stars (meteors) occurred before this (i.e. the prophethood of Muhammad), however it did not happen much, rather only occasionally. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every sane person can see that the argument of Ibn Kathir is nothing more than a lame excuse and a lie. There is no proof that incidents of meteors occurred only occasionally before Muhammad, and their rate increased after his prophethood. Meteors were falling all over the world, and none of the people of that era in the rest of the world noted any increase in the rate of meteors after the prophethood of Muhammad. </p>
<h2 class="indexed"><span id="seventh-blunder-iblis-and-his-entire-nation-of-satans-were-unaware-of-the-prophethood-of-muhammad-and-existence-of-the-muslims-for-many-years" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_text">Seventh Blunder: Iblis and His Entire Nation of Satans Were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">Unaware</span> of the Prophethood of Muhammad and existence of the Muslims <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">for Many Years</span></span></h2>
<p>In the Islamic narrative, initially, there was only one Iblis (Satan/Lucifer). However, a question arose: How could this lone Iblis manage to reach millions of people around the world at every moment and tempt them all simultaneously? What, then, would be the difference between the solitary Satan and the monotheistic God, as both would seemingly exist everywhere at all times?</p>
<p>Thus, the Islamic story evolved, and now Satan was given minions—lesser devils were introduced. However, even the solitary Satan, like the monotheistic God, could not have offspring in this sense.</p>
<p>Then, in the Islamic narrative, the jinn were declared to be the lesser devils. These lesser devils (jinn) could marry and produce offspring.</p>
<p>[Note: The concept of "jinn" does not exist in the Bible of the Jews and Christians, but Muhammad adopted this idea of jinn from the Arab culture of the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic era), where the belief in jinn was prevalent.]</p>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/jinni">Source: https://www.britannica.com/topic/jinni</a><span></span></p>
<p>Moreover, Muhammad narrated a strange story, according to which neither Iblis nor small devils were aware of existence of Muhammad, his prophethood and the Muslims for many years. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:449">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 449</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn 'Abbas reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) neither recited the Qur'an to the Jinn nor did he see them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out with some of his Companions with the intention of going to the bazaar of 'Ukaz And there had been (at that time) obstructions between satans and the news from the Heaven, and there were flung flames upon them. So satan went back to their people and they said: What has happened to you? They said: There have been created obstructions between us and the news from the Heaven. And there have been flung upon us flames. <strong>They said: It cannot happen but for some (important) event. So traverse the eastern parts of the earth and the western parts and find out why is it that there have been created obstructions between us and the news from the Heaven. So they went forth and traversed the easts of the earth and its wests. Some of them proceeded towards Tihama and that is a nakhl towards the bazaar of 'Ukaz and he (the Holy Prophet) was leading his Companions in the morning prayer. So when they heard the Qur'an. they listened to it attentively and said: It is this which has caused obstruction between us and news from the Heaven. They went back to their people and said: O our people, we have heard a strange Qur'an which directs us to the right path; so we affirm our faith in it and we would never associate anyone with our Lord.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>And also look at this hadith, where Iblis is himself unawre of Muhammad and Muslims for many years: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3324">Sunan Tirmidhi, Hadith 3324</a>:</p>
Ibn Abbas said: “The jinns used to ascent through the heavens, trying to listen about the Revelation. So when they heard a statement, they would add nine to it. The statement that they heard would be true, while what they added was false. So it was with the advent of the Messenger of Allah that they were prevented from their places. So they mentioned that to <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><em><strong>Iblis</strong></em></span> – and the stars were not shot at them before that. <em>So Iblis said to them: ‘This is naught but an event that has occurred in the earth.’ So he sent out his armies, and they found the Messenger of Allah standing in Salat between two mountains” – I think he said “in Makkah” – “So they (returned) to meet with him (Iblis), and informed him. He said: ‘This is the event that has happened on the earth.’”</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Grade</strong>: <em>Sahih</em> (Darussalam)</blockquote>
<p>So, Muhammad asserted that after the shooting stars began striking the Jinns, some of them came to him and embraced Islam under his guidance. Through this narrative, Muhammad aimed to further elevate his significance and instill greater fear in the hearts of his followers by implying that even jinn were under his control.</p>
<p>However, the tale became highly implausible, as it implied that:</p>
<ul>
<li>No devil was present in Mecca for many years since none of them were aware of Muhammad's prophethood and existence of the Muslims.</li>
<li>This would imply that during all those years, the pagans of Mecca were free from committing any sin, as no devils were present in Mecca to mislead them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can any rational person believe such an implausible story? It is clear that when trying to cover up one lie, many more are often needed, and this narrative of Iblis' ignorance about Muhammad's prophethood for several years seems to be one such attempt.</p>
<p>And it was Muhammad himself, who otherwise claimed that a jinn is attached to every person:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2815">Sahih Muslim 2815</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>A'isha the wife of Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), reported that one day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came out of her (apartment) during the night and she felt jealous. Then he came and he saw me (in what agitated state of mind) I was. He said:</p>
</div>
<div class="text_details">A'isha, what has happened to you? Do you feel jealous? Thereupon she said: How can it be (that a woman like me) should not feel jealous in regard to a husband like you. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: It was your devil who had come to you, and she said: Allah's Messenger, is there along with me a devil? He said: Yes. I said: <strong>Is a devil attached to everyone? He said: <span style="color: rgb(254, 0, 0);">Yes</span>.</strong> I (Aisha) again said: Allah's Messenger,<strong> is it with you also? He said: Yes, but my Lord has helped me against him and as such I am absolutely safe from his mischief.</strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Where there are lies, there are also often <strong>CONTRADICTIONS</strong>, which we see in this case.<strong> </strong>Muhammad was only a human and it was not possible for him not to make human mistakes while narrating such fantastical stories. </p>
<h2 class="indexed"><span id="section-8th-blunder-the-false-challenge-of-allah-that-humans-and-jinns-cannot-cross-the-regions-of-heavens-and-earth" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_text"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId209155"></a>8th Blunder: The false Challenge of Allah that humans (and Jinns) cannot cross the regions of heavens and EARTH</span></h2>
<p>In Quranic verses 55:33-35, Allah challenges the jinn and mankind, daring them to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the Earth without His permission. The text suggests that those who try will be met with a flame of fire and smoke that they cannot defend against.</p>
<p>Quran 55:33-35:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O company of jinn and mankind,<strong> if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass</strong>. You will not pass except by authority/permission [from Allah] ... <strong>There will be sent upon you a <em>flame of fire (i.e. meteor) and smoke</em></strong>, and you will not be able to defend yourselves.</p>

<p>The desire to reach the heavens and encounter God is a recurring theme in various cultures and historical accounts, and the Quran also presents a story about Pharaoh's ambitious endeavor to construct a tower reaching the heavens. In Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/28.38">28:38</a> and Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/40.37">40:36-37</a>, it is narrated that Pharaoh instructed his minister Haman to build such a structure, hoping to challenge the divine authority of Moses' God. And there were also many stories in earlier civilizations that Pharaoh indeed reached near heaven. Imam Qurtabi recorded one such story in his commentary of this verse 28:38 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&tTafsirNo=5&tSoraNo=28&tAyahNo=38&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=1">link</a>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As-Suddi reported that Pharaoh climbed upon the tower and threw an arrow towards the sky, so it came down stained with blood. So Pharaoh said, 'I killed the God of Moosa (Moses).' It was reported that when Pharaoh said this, Allaah sent down Jibreel who struck the tower with his wing and cut it into three pieces</p>

<p>That is why, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) challenged that nobody can cross the regions of heaven and the earth. </p>
<p>However, contrary to Allah's claim, non-Muslims, atheists, and Hindus, who all deny Allah, have already crossed the regions of the Earth without His permission, and no flame of fire or smoke has stopped them.</p>
<p>This Quranic verse (which is threatening humans &amp; Jinns with <strong>flame of fire and smoke</strong>) seems to have a connection to the story in other parts of the Quran, where devils attempt to sit in the 1st heaven, and stars transform into <strong>flames of fire (i.e. meteors)</strong> to chase and attack them.</p>
<h3 class="indexed"><span id="muslim-excuse-these-are-not-meteors-but-the-guided-pulsar-gamma-rays-which-are-used-to-shoot-down-the-devils-by-allah" class="anchor"></span><span class="heading_text"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId349922"></a>Muslim Excuse: These are not meteors, but the <em>Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays, which</em> are used to shoot down the devils by Allah</span></h3>
<p>Furthermore, Muslim apologists sometimes claim that these challenges involve "Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays" (<a href="https://www.answering-christianity.com/shooting_stars_miracle.htm">link</a>) used by Allah to shoot down devils. However, this excuse has no basis in the original Quranic claim, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays" are not guided; they disperse in all directions and are invisible.</li>
<li>These gamma rays do not resemble burning flames of fire.</li>
<li>The Quran and Hadith specifically mention shooting stars (meteors) as the means to hit devils, not any form of invisible gamma rays.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="mw-headline">Moreover, t<span>he idea of shooting stars chasing away eavesdropping devils may have Jewish roots.</span></span></p>
<p><span>In the Testament of Solomon:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>The firmament is conceived in a tripartite structure and demons are portrayed as being capable of flying up to and past the firmament in order to eavesdrop on the decisions of God. (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testament_of_Solomon">Testament of Solomon - Wikipedia</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>In the Babylonian Talmud, demons are described as having some angelic qualities, including:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><span class="mt-md block"></span>"They know what will be in the future like ministering angels. The Gemara is puzzled by this last statement: Should it enter your mind that they know this? Not even the angels are privy to the future. Rather, they hear from behind the curtain when God reveals something of the future, like ministering angels." </span></p>

<p>In conclusion, even a single scientific mistake in the Quran is significant, as it challenges the notion of 100%  Allah's perfection and cast doubt on the authenticity of the entire Islamic belief system.</p>

<p>The killing of prisoners is not only a “war crime” today, but even the Arabs of time of ignorance hated this act. But Muhammad's morals were even worse than the Arabs of the time of ignorance.</p>
<p>Islamic preachers today do false propaganda that killing prisoners (who surrendered) is not allowed. But this is a lie, as Muhammad himself killed 800 men of Banu Qurayzah, who surrendered and accepted to become prisoners of Muhammad.</p>
<p>It was not an exceptional case, but the Quran is itself a witness that the slaughter of prisoners is necessary upon the prophet:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/8.67">8:67</a>) <strong>It is not fit for any prophet to have captives until he has made slaughter of them in the land</strong>. You desire the frail goods of this world, while Allah desires (for you) the hereafter</blockquote>

<p>Ishaq bin Mansur said: "I said to Ahmad: 'When the captives are captured' is killing or ransoming better to you?' He said: 'If they are able to ransom (by paying huge amount of money) then there is no harm in it. And if they (are) killed, then I do not know of any harm in it.'"

<p>Women were innocent. They had no part in the decisions of wars. They neither participated in the wars nor killed any Muslims. But despite this, Muhammad ordered the looting of captive women and then made them slaves.</p>
<p>And Muhammad also allowed raping the captive women in a Shia Mutta-type “<strong>Temporary</strong> Sexual Relationship”. This means that after fulfilling the lust, a master handed her over to his brother or any slave. And when all brothers and slaves also raped her one by one, then she was sold to another master, who again raped her, and then sold to the 3rd master .... and this chain of rape of slave women in temporary sexual relationships continued.</p>

<p><strong>Halal International Slave Trading</strong>:</p>
<p>Instead of giving freedom to poor women captives, and letting them go to their relatives, Muhammad made it Halal to use them even for international slave trading. Muhammad sold the Jewish captive women of Banu Qurayzah (who believed in a God) to Kuffar (who were polytheists). </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Then the apostle sent Sa`d b. Zayd al-Ansari brother of b. `Abdu’l-Ashhal with some of the captive women of B. Qurayza to Najd and he sold them for horses and weapons.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, Islamic countries became some of the biggest hubs of international slave trading. </p>

<p>Young Children were also made slaves for the whole of their lives.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Young and small girls and boys (under the age of 12)  had no role in the wars against Muslims, but still, they were also made slaves for their entire lives and were compelled to serve their Muslim masters for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even worse, the coming generations of these slave children were also born automatically as slaves too. It was due to the EVIL of “<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Slavery by Birth</strong>” in Muhammad's Islam.

Ali replied: "Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus.

<p>وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة<br>"It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing<em> Istibra</em>, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.<br>As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a <em><strong>virgin and not pubescent</strong></em>. He recognized that someone like her need not observe<em> Istibra</em>, and<em><strong> it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.</strong></em>"<br>Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.</p>

<p>Can you imagine the trauma of these small pre-pubescent girls? Their fathers and brothers were killed during the daytime, and Muslim Jihadists were raping them the same night.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/56/221">Sahih Bukhari, 3012</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me at a place called Al-Abwa or Waddan, and was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "<strong>They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)</strong>."</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1745b">Sahih Muslim 1745b</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>It is narrated by Sa'b b. Jaththama that he said (to the Holy Prophet): Messenger of Allah, we kill the children of the polytheists during the night raids. He said: <strong>They are from them</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words of Muhammad (i.e.  <strong>They are from them</strong>) are extremely problematic. With these words, he is encouraging his companions to become <strong>merciless </strong>against children and women during attacks, as there is no problem killing them as they also belong to pagan Kafirs. </p>
<p>Collateral damage is something else. For that, Muhammad had to tell his companions to avoid killing children and women as much as possible if they were not armed against them and attacking them. However, with the usage of the words {<strong>They are from them</strong> i.e. the pagan Kuffar} he incited hatred in his companions against children and women too. </p>
<p>The US took thousands of times more precautions than Muhammad, in order to avoid the killing of innocent children and women while bombing the terrorists of al-Qaeda and Taliban and ISIS. </p>

He wrote (in reply) to me that <strong>it was necessary (only) in the early days of Islam.</strong> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at the water. He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Why this ruling of invitation to Islam and the last chance to save themselves was abrogated? The answer is, only for the greed of more looting and more women and more graze-lands.</p>
<blockquote>

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId496684"></a>Either accept Islam, or you will be beheaded</h2>
<p>Please note that JIZYA was allowed only for the 'people of the book' (i.e. Christians, Jews, Magians). As far as polytheists and all other religions were concerned, there was no JIZYA for them, but they had to accept either Islam or be killed. </p>
<p>Islam Q&amp;A is the largest Muslim Fatwa Website, which is run by Saudi Salafi Scholars. It writes (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34770/there-is-no-compulsion-to-accept-islam">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The kuffaar (i.e. polytheists) should be compelled to enter Islam</strong> if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken (i.e. from the people of book), because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood.<strong> Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allaah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential,</strong> because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued. <br>Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, <strong>because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is why ISIS took Jizya from Christians in Iraq but didn't accept the Jizya from “Yazidis”. Following Muhammad, ISIS slaughtered all the Yazidi men and took all their women as slaves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira: The Verse:--"You (true Muslims) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind." means, the best of peoples for the people, as you bring them with chains on their necks <strong>till they embrace Islam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId82845"></a>Jizya was enforced only in order to humiliate Jews &amp; Christians</h2>
<p>Pagans were compelled directly to accept Islam under the threat of beheading them otherwise. </p>
<p>While Jews &amp; Christians were also compelled Indirectly to accept Islam by humiliating them through Jizya. </p>
<p>The Quran is clear about this humiliation through Jizyah. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran 9:28-29) يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْمُشْرِكُونَ <strong>نَجَسٌ </strong>فَلاَ يَقْرَبُواْ الْمَسْجِدَ الْحَرَامَ بَعْدَ عَامِهِمْ هَـذَا وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ عَيْلَةً فَسَوْفَ يُغْنِيكُمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِن شَآءَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ - قَـتِلُواْ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَلاَ بِالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَلاَ يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَلاَ يَدِينُونَ دِينَ الْحَقِّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ حَتَّى يُعْطُواْ الْجِزْيَةَ عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ <strong>صَـغِرُونَ </strong></p>

<p>O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are <strong>unclean (/impure/filthy)</strong>; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque ... Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, of the People of the Book (i.e. Christians and Jews and Zoroastrians), until they pay the Jizya (tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves <em><strong>humiliated (</strong><strong>Arabic</strong><strong>: صَـغِرُونَ)</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here صَـغِرُونَ is an Arabic word, which means humiliation (<a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=9&vid=29" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">link</a>). This same word has also been used in Quran in verse (<a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=7&vid=119" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">7:119</a>) and verse (<a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=7&vid=13" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">7:113</a>) with the same meaning of “Humiliation”.</p>
<p>Ibn Kathir wrote in the commentary of this verse 9:29 (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180603162803/http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2566&Itemid=64">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>(and feel themselves subdued.), disgraced, humiliated and belittled</strong>. Therefore, Muslims are not allowed to honor the people of Dhimmah or elevate them above Muslims, for they are miserable, disgraced and humiliated. Muslim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, لَا تَبْدَءُوا الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَارَى بِالسَّلَامِ، وَإِذَا لَقِيتُمْ أَحَدَهُمْ فِي طَرِيقٍ فَاضْطَرُّوهُ إِلَى أَضْيَقِه (Do not initiate the Salam to the Jews and Christians, and if you meet any of them in a road, force them to its narrowest alley).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note:</p>
<p><strong>Jizya has nothing to do with the exemption of Jihad (as Islam apologists claim). Muslims went for Jihad, and they got a share of the war Booty as a reward, while non-Muslims didn't get any war booty. </strong>If any Muslim does not go for Jihad, he will not get a share of war booty, but at least he does not have to pay Jizyah. But Jews &amp; Christians will not get a share from war booty, and as well as they have to pay the Jizya. </p>

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>In brief, Muhammad brought 100% destruction upon his opponents. He slaughtered men or made them slaves. He took all women as slaves and let his companions rape them. He also made all small children slaves for their entire lives (although they were innocent and had no role in wars). And the later generations of those slave children were also automatically born as slaves due to the evil of Slavery By Birth in Islam. </p>

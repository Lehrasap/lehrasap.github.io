</ul>
<p>Muhammad and his Allah made this critical error by failing to understand the original questions.</p>
<p>The Jews asked Muhammad the following 3 Questions from<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16484"> The Book of Denial</a> (The Bible).</p>

<p>The Jews asked Muhammad about the "<strong>Spirit of God <span class="mw-page-title-main"><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3">الروح القدس</a></span></strong>" in the context of the Book of Daniel (i.e. if Daniel <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84"><span dir="rtl">دانيال</span></a> was a prophet or not despite the fact that the Spirit of God showed him "Visions").</p>
<p>A significant dispute arose when the Christians regarded Daniel as a prophet, as the Spirit of God had shown him visions, whereas the Jews did not. Consequently, the Jews believed that if Muhammad was truly a prophet of God, he would be able to resolve this disagreement.</p>

<p>However, Muhammad (and his Allah) didn't have any clue about the original question, and he thought it about "Human Spirit". Thus Muhammad gave a very VAGUE answer:</p>

This legend was not even a part of the Bible, but only a later days Christian legend.

<p>Additionally, Muhammad (and his Allah) also became confused about the NUMBERS of people, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original story in the Book of Daniel involved 3 young men.</li>
<li>The Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus involved 7 people (with some versions mentioning 8), who were sleeping in the cave.</li>

<h2>Details:</h2>
<p>In the 2nd part of this series of "The Test", we saw how Muhammad (and his Allah) FAILED constantly to show even a single tinniest miracle in front of the pagan Meccans, despite repetitive demand from them. Please read this 2nd part here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="48-allah-failed-to-pass-his-own-test-of-showing-a-miracle.html">Allah's FAILURE to pass his own <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>TEST</strong></span> of showing any <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>MIRACLE</strong></span> to the Pagans</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The pagan Meccans, in an attempt to test Muhammad's claims further, sought assistance from the Jews. The Jews sent them three challenging questions, which should serve as a Test i.e. if Muhammad could answer those questions through revelation from Allah. </p>
<p>When the Meccans presented these questions to Muhammad, he struggled to provide answers for a period of 15 days (as he was gathering information from people, instead of getting any information through revelation). He then attributed this delay to the absence of Gabriel, claiming that the presence of a puppy in his home prevented the angelic visitation.</p>
<p>Imam Syuti documented the following tradition in his commentary concerning this verse<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&tTafsirNo=26&tSoraNo=18&tAyahNo=23&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=1">18:23 (link)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أخرج ابن المنذرعن مجاهد، أن قريشاً اجتمعت فقالوا: " يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، فما هذا الدين الذي جئت به؟ قال: هذا دين جئت به من الرحمن. فقالوا: إنا لا نعرف الرحمن، إلا رحمن اليمامة - يعنون مسيلمة الكذاب - ثم كاتبوا اليهود فقالوا: قد نبغ فينا رجل يزعم أنه نبي، وقد رغب عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، ويزعم أن الذي جاء به من الرحمن. قلنا: لا نعرف الرحمن إلا رحمن اليمامة، وهو أمين لا يخون.. وفيّ لا يغدر.. صدوق لا يكذب، وهو في حسب وثروة من قومه، فاكتبوا إلينا بأشياء نسأله عنها. فاجتمعت يهود فقالوا: إن هذا لوصفه وزمانه الذي يخرج فيه. فكتبوا إلى قريش: أن سلوه عن أمر أصحاب الكهف، وعن ذي القرنين، وعن الروح. فإن يكن الذي أتاكم به من الرحمن، فإن الرحمن هو الله عز وجل، وإن يكن من رحمن اليمامة فينقطع. فلما أتى ذلك قريشاً أتى الظفر في أنفسها فقالوا: يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائك... فحدثنا عن أمر أصحاب الكهف وذي القرنين والروح. قال: ائتوني غداً. ولم يستثن، فمكث جبريل عنه ما شاء الله لا يأتيه، ثم أتاه فقال: سألوني عن أشياء لم يكن عندي بها علم فأجيب حتى شق ذلك عليّ. قال: ألم ترنا لا ندخل بيتاً فيه كلب ولا صورة؟ - وكان في البيت جرو كلب - ونزلت { ولا تقولن لشيء إني فاعل ذلك غداً إلا أن يشاء الله واذكر ربك إذا نسيت وقل عسى أن يهدين ربي لأقرب من هذا رشداً } من علم الذي سألتموني عنه أن يأتي قبل غد؟ ونزل ما ذكر من أصحاب الكهف ونزل{ ويسألونك عن الروح... } [الإسراء: 85] الآية ".</p>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic">... Quraysh (the pagan tribe of Muhammad) wrote to Jews that there had appeared a person among them, who claims himself to be a prophet, and he had left the religion of their ancestors ... Jews replied: "Asked him 3 questions about the Ashab-e-Kuhf (The people of Cave), Dhulqarnain ("the Two-Horned One") and Ruh (i.e. the Spirit) ... Quraysh became happy upon it and they said to Muhammad: "If you have already left the religion of our ancestors, then tell us about Ashab-e-Kuhf (The people of Cave), Dhulqarnain, and the spirit."  Muhammad said to them: "Come to me tomorrow (and I will reply)." But Muhammad forgot to say Insha-Allah (i.e. if Allah wills). <strong>Gabriel came to him after only 15 days.</strong> Muhammad said to Gabriel: "Quraysh came to me and they asked me about somethings (as a test of my prophethood), which I didn't know. Thus, I was in a very difficult state during this period." Gabriel replied: <em><strong>"Have you not seen we (i.e. angels) don't enter a house which has a dog or a picture? And there was a puppy in your house (who entered the house and Muhammad didn't know about it).</strong></em>" Upon that this verse was revealed: [... <em><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>and do not enquire about those questions from any one of them<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"> (i.e. Muhammad was collecting information about those 3 questions from people during those 15 days)</span></strong></span>.</em> <em><strong>And never say of anything, "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow," Except (when adding), "If Allah wills</strong>." </em>Quran 18:22-24] </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual situation was as under:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muhammad neither knew the answers to the three questions nor was he in contact with any Allah or angel.</li>
<li>Consequently, Muhammad began <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>enquiring about those questions from others (<span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);">and the Quran (verse <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/18/22/default.htm">18:22</a>) is itself a witness of this action of Muhammad</span>)</strong></span>. It took him 15 days to gather some information about those 3 questions. </li>
<li>Later Muhammad made an excuse that he was unable to answer the questions the next day, as he had forgotten to say Insha-Allah (if God wills). And he claimed that a puppy entering his house prevented Gabriel from delivering the answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, those answers from Muhammad (which consisted of alleged divine revelation), were not only "incomplete", but Muhammad (and his Allah) were not even able to understand the original Jewish questions. </p>
<h2>Background of the 3 Jewish Questions:</h2>
<p>(The following information is provided by Adam ElMasri in his video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSFwSvX1RoU">Link</a>), along with some additions made by us)</p>
<h3>The First Question:</h3>
<p>For a long period before Islam began, both Christians and Jews tried to classify and canonize the books of the Bible. A few decades prior to Islam, an interesting dispute arose between Christians and Jews, precisely around the prophetic books. The Jewish Bible is divided into three sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>Torah (the first 5 books that consist of the law),</li>
<li>Ketovim (which means the writings),</li>
<li>and Navieem (which means the prophets).</li>
</ol>
<p>When it came to classifying and canonizing <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16484">The Book of Denial</a>, a big argument occurred between some Jewish rabbis and other Jewish sects and Christians about whether the book of Daniel should be included in the Navieem (writing) section or in the Ketovim (prophets) section.</p>
<p>In fact, the core argument was about whether Daniel is a prophet or not!</p>
<p>Jews then canonized the book of Daniel in the Ketovim (writings ... i.e. Daniel (Arabic: <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84"><span dir="rtl">دانيال</span></a>) was not a prophet), while Christians placed the book of Daniel in the prophets (Navieem). The debate continued for decades.</p>
<p>Daniel himself claimed that he had seen a <strong>vision</strong>. But in Rabbinic sources, there is a clear distinction between a <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);">prophetic vision</span></strong> and a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>prophecy</strong></span> through <span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);"><strong>the spirit of God</strong></span>, which is called in Hebrew <strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);">Ruach ha Kodesh</span></strong>, in Arabic Al Rouh el Kodos <span class="mw-page-title-main"><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3">الروح القدس</a> </span>or the Holy Spirit, sometimes referred to simply as The Spirit – Ha Ruach – Al Rouh الروح. This is the spirit that the Jews asked Muhammad about, and he had no clue what they were talking about.</p>
<p>The prophethood of Daniel was a hot debate topic, whether he was a prophet or not, until just a few decades before Muhammad. Therefore, the Jews believed that if Muhammad was truly a prophet of God, he would be able to resolve this dispute. Thus, they asked Muhammad this question. However, Muhammad disappeared for 15 days trying to find clues with no luck. So he came back with this answer: (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.85">17:85</a>):"They ask you about the Spirit. Say: '<em>The Spirit is by command of my Lord, and you have not been given of knowledge except a little.</em>'"</p>
<p>In essence, Muhammad evaded answering the this question completely by using the excuse that only limited knowledge about the spirit is granted to humans.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1735365/jewish/Why-Isnt-the-Book-of-Daniel-Part-of-the-Prophets.htm">Why Isn’t the Book of Daniel Part of the Prophets?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The 2nd Question:</h2>
<p>There existed two famous (but very much similar) stories at that time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one was in the Book of Daniel (in the Bible) involving 3 young Jewish men.  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%203%3A8-30&version=NIV"><strong>Daniel 3:8-30 (NIV)</strong></a> . And the Jews beleived in it. </li>
<li>The second story was about "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seven-Sleepers-of-Ephesus">The Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus</a> (i.e. The people of the Cave)", which involved 7 Christian people (with some versions mentioning 8 people. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seven-Sleepers-of-Ephesus">Link</a>). It was not even a part of the Bible. and the Jews didn't even believe in it (but opposed it, as it was telling about 3 faithful Christians, who were enemies of the Jews).  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Jews asked Muhammad about the first strory from the Book of Daniel (in the Bible). But Muhammad and his Allah got confused, and thought it was about the 2nd story of the Christian legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus (i.e. The people of the Cave).</p>
<p>The resemblance between the story of the three young men in the Book of Daniel and the legend of the seven sleepers lies primarily in their themes of faith, divine protection, and miraculous preservation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Faith and Divine Protection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three Young Jewish Men in the Book of Daniel</strong>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown into a fiery furnace for refusing to worship a golden statue set up by King Nebuchadnezzar. Their unwavering faith in God led to their miraculous preservation. An angel protected them, and they emerged from the furnace unharmed, demonstrating God's power and their faith.</li>
<li><strong>Legend of the Seven (or Eight) Sleepers</strong>: This Christian legend (which was not a part of the Bible) tells of seven or eight young Christian men who hid in a cave to escape persecution for their faith. They fell asleep and miraculously awoke centuries later, unharmed and unchanged, during a time when Christianity was no longer persecuted. Their story is seen as a testament to divine protection and the enduring nature of faith.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Miraculous Preservation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three Young Men</strong>: The miracle here is their survival in the fiery furnace without any harm, symbolizing God's direct intervention and protection.</li>
<li><strong>Seven (or Eight) Sleepers</strong>: The miracle is their prolonged sleep and preservation over centuries, which serves as a sign of God's care and the passage of time without physical change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to resemblance in these two stories, the people (whom Muhammad enquired for information) got confused, which made Muhammad ultra confused as a result. Thus, Muhammad mixed the both stories and clamed their numbers exactly from 3 to eight in the Quran.</p>

<p><span>سَیَقُولُونَ ثَلَـٰثَةࣱ رَّابِعُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡ وَیَقُولُونَ خَمۡسَةࣱ سَادِسُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡ رَجۡمَۢا بِٱلۡغَیۡبِۖ وَیَقُولُونَ سَبۡعَةࣱ وَثَامِنُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡۚ قُل رَّبِّیۤ أَعۡلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِم مَّا یَعۡلَمُهُمۡ إِلَّا قَلِیلࣱۗ فَلَا تُمَارِ فِیهِمۡ إِلَّا مِرَاۤءࣰ ظَـٰهِرࣰا وَلَا <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>تَسۡتَفۡتِ</strong></span> فِیهِم مِّنۡهُمۡ أَحَدࣰا</span></p>
<p><span>They will say there were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>three</strong></span>, the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">fourth</span></strong> of them being their dog; and they will say there were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>five</strong></span>, the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">sixth</span></strong> of them being their dog - guessing at the unseen; and they will say there were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>seven</strong></span>, and the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">eighth</span></strong> of them was their dog. Say, [O Muhammad], "My Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows them except a few. So do not argue about them except with an obvious argument <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>and do not <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">inquire <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">(arabic:  تَسۡتَفۡتِ)</span></span> about them from anyone among them.</strong></span>" (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=18&verse=22">Translated by Corpus Quran</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, the question is, why was Muhammad <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>ENQUIRING</strong></span> others about these questions? This alone is enough to understand that the answers were not delivered to him by any angel, but rather, he gathered information by <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>Enquiring</strong></span> from people during those 15 days. People were not fools, and they were able to see Muhammad asking people about those information. They started making fun of his Allah. Thus, Muhammad wanted to deflect the blame from his Allah and thus showed if he was enquiring about them from people on his own, while his Allah later stopped him from doing it.</p>
<p>Muhammad claimed that his Allah was 100% perfect and all-knowing. Therefore, it was crucial for Muhammad to keep his Allah free from any accusations of ignorance or shortcomings. To achieve this, Muhammad often employed the tactic of taking the blame upon himself to deflect any criticism from his Allah. An example of this can be seen in the incident of the <a href="../divine-revelation-or-human-drama/85-satanic-verses-the-original-incident-exposing-muhammad-revelation.html">Satanic Verses (Quran 17:73-75)</a>, where he assumed full responsibility for the Satanic Verses, thereby absolving his Allah of any fault.</p>
<p>Secondly, on one hand, Muhammad asserted that Allah possessed precise knowledge of the number of people in the cave, but on the other hand, Allah did not disclose the exact figures. The question arises: Why? One wonders, <strong><span style="color: rgb(230, 126, 35);">what potential harm would have arisen if Allah had revealed the precise numbers of the people in the cave</span></strong>? </p>
<p>Thirdly, Please also note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original story in the Book of Daniel involved 3 young men.</li>
<li>The Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus involved 7 people (with some versions mentioning 8), who were sleeping in the cave.</li>
<li>Thus, Muhammad mixed both of these stories and came to the figures of 3 to 8 in the Quran. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fourthly, this legend was not even a part of the Bible, but only a later made legend by Christians. And Jews could not have asked about this Christian legend, as it is about PIOUS and Faithful Christian men, which went against Jewish beliefs. </p>
<h3>The 3rd Question:</h3>
<p>Then the Jews asked about the story of the ram with 2 horns in the Book of Daniel. However, Muhammad got confused and thought that the Jews were asking about Alexander the Great (who was also historically known as "the Two-Horned One"). </p>
<p>Jews then asked Muhammad and his Allah about a story from the Book of Daniel (Bible), which was a dream involving a ram with two horns.</p>
<p>Firstly, the verse 3 to 4 are telling about the VISION about the ram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 8:3-4: <br></strong>I looked up (in the vision), and there before me was a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>ram with two horns</strong></span>, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. I watched the ram as it charged toward <span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);"><strong>the west and the north and the south</strong></span>. <strong>No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power</strong>. It did as it pleased and became <strong>great</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the verse 20 gave the interpretation of the VISION:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 8:20: <br></strong><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 9);">The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia</span> </strong>...<span id="en-NIV-21985" class="text Dan-8-23">“In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise.</span> <span id="en-NIV-21986" class="text Dan-8-24">He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people.</span> <span id="en-NIV-21987" class="text Dan-8-25">He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Muhammad falsely thought that the Jews were asking the question about the story of Alexander the Great, who was also historically known as "the Two-Horned One."  In Hellenistic culture, Alexander the Great was depicted with horns, symbolizing divinity and power. For example, coins from the era of Alexander depict him with ram's horns, which were associated with the Egyptian god Amun. Alexander was declared the son of Amun in the Siwa Oasis, and this imagery was used to represent his divine status and authority.</p>
<p>The Quranic Arabic word "Dhulqarnain" itself literally means "<strong>the two-horned one.</strong>"</p>
<p>And then Muhammad gave the following answer about this story, in which Dhulqarnain goes to the West and no one could stand against him. Later he went to the East, and again no one could stand against him. Then he went to the North, and again no one could stand against him. </p>
<p>The story of Dhul-Qarnain is found in Surah Al-Kahf (Chapter 18) of the Quran, verses 83-101. Dhul-Qarnain is presented as a righteous and powerful ruler who embarks on three major expeditions across the world, guided by divine wisdom and justice. Here is a summary of his story and expeditions:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Expedition: The Western Expedition</strong></span></p>
<p>Dhul-Qarnain's first journey takes him to the far west, where he reaches the setting place of the sun, described as a "murky spring." There, he finds a people living in that region. God gives him the choice to either punish them or treat them with kindness. Dhul-Qarnain chooses justice, rewarding those who do good and punishing wrongdoers. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Second Expedition: The Eastern Expedition</strong></span></p>
<p>His second journey takes him to the far east, where he finds a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third Expedition: The Northern Expedition and the Barrier</strong></span></p>
<p>In his final and most famous expedition, Dhul-Qarnain travels to a region between two mountains. There, he encounters a people who seek his help against the tribes of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj), who are causing great corruption and havoc. Dhul-Qarnain agrees to help them and constructs a massive barrier of iron and molten copper between the mountains, effectively containing Gog and Magog. He declares that this barrier will hold until the Day of Judgment when God will cause it to collapse.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad failed to provide a clear answer regarding the true identity of Dhulqarnain, leading to ongoing confusion among Muslims. The vague response given by the Quran and Muhammad perpetuated an endless cycle of uncertainty. This confusion is exemplified by various contradictory statements.</p>
<p>Firstly, Muslim apologists claimed that it was <strong>Alexander the Great</strong> who was Dhulqarnain. But then the problem occurred that historical and archaeological evidence reveals that Alexander the Great was a polytheist who believed he was the literal son of Greek and Egyptian gods. Moreover, the version of the Quran includes Alexander building a huge iron wall (Gates of Alexander) to trap the people of Gog and Magog behind, which will be broken at the end of times. However there's no evidence this wall exists at all, and Muslims suddenly started claiming 'it's somewhere underground' once Google Maps became a thing.</p>
<p>Thus, Islamic apologists tried to shift the identity of Dhul Qarnayn from Alexander to other prominent historical kings, such as <strong>Cyrus the Great</strong>. However, that shift holds very little evidence and has major flaws compared to the overwhelming evidence that the story is actually based on the Syriac legend of Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's not going to be Cyrus either, because, like Alexander, he also prayed to and tolerated pagan deities and religions, not very Islamic.</p>
<p>Muslims have to suffer for centuries due to all these contradictions, while Muhammad (and his Allah) were not able to tell clearly about the story of ram with two horns. </p>
<h2>Islamist apologist: How can you be sure that the Jews asked questions from the Book of Daniel?</h2>
<p>An apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But how do you know that they were asking about the book of Daniel? It seems you just put your own interpretation of the questions and blame Muhammad for not using the same interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Just use common sense, and everyone can easily see the Truth. </p>
<p>Muslims did not preserve any Jewish or Pagan writings or oral narratives for future generations, which could have provided their version of the story. Thus, we are left only with the Quran and Muslim traditions. However, as humans, we have <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">COMMON SENSE</span></strong> and can still deduce conclusions from surrounding evidences.</p>
<p>Please consider these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why would the Jews ask about a Christian legend instead of the original Bible? How could they ask about something that contradicted their beliefs, as they did not consider Christians to be faithful and righteous people?</li>
<li>And why did Muhammad/Allah became confused about the exact numbers of person? How did Muhammad (and his Allah) mentioned EXACTLY the figures of 3 to 8? </li>
<li value="3">And what harm had it caused, if Allah would have told the exact numbers?</li>
<li>What purpose would it serve for the Jews to ask about the <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>INFIDEL</strong></span> Alexander the Great and his achievements?</li>
<li>What interest would there be for the Jews in asking about the "Human Spirit"? But surely, they had a great interestest in SOLVING the great DISPUTE, if the vision shown by the "<strong>Spirit of God</strong> <a class="relative pointer-events-auto a

  " href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">الروح القدس</a>" is an evidence of prophethood or not. </li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, consider this: <strong>How many pagans or Jews converted to Islam due to Muhammad's answers to these questions?</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps none.</p>
<p>If Muhammad had miraculously provided correct answers to these three questions through revelation, <strong>it would be logical to expect a significant number of pagans and Jews to convert to Islam due to this miracle</strong>. <strong>However,<em><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"> it appears that not a single Pagan/Jew converted to Islam as a result of these revelatory answers</span></em></strong><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">.</span></em> Why?</p>
<p>In the second part of this series, we saw that pagans and Jews constantly asked Muhammad to show them any miracle. The Quran records many excuses from Muhammad for his inability to show any miracle, <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><em><strong>but neither Muhammad nor the Quran once used these three answers as proof of miracle</strong></em></span>. Why?</p>
<p>Moreover, please also reflect on this question: "Was there any <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>MIRACOLOUS Information</strong></span> present in the 3 answers that Muhammad provided"? The story of Alexander the Great was well-known among the masses, as was the story of the sleepers in the cave.  And would it not be logical that Allah would have told the exact numbers, so that Muhammad should not have to enquire their numbers from them? Similarly, how can Muhammad's response, “The Spirit belongs to the domain of my Lord; and you were given only little knowledge,” be considered "<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>miraculous information</strong></span>?" Please ask this question to yourself, if it was not possible for any false prophet to gather such superficial (non-miraculous information) during those 15 days? </p>

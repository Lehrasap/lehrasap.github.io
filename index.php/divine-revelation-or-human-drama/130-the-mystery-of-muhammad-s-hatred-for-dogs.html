<p>Dogs unfortunately became scapegoats.</p>
<p>This began when the pagans of Mecca presented three questions to Muhammad as a test. However, he was unable to provide answers for the next 15 days. Muhammad then offered an excuse, stating that Gabriel had not visited him with the answers because there was a puppy in his home.</p>
<p>Imam Syuti documented the following tradition in the commentary on verse <a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&tTafsirNo=26&tSoraNo=18&tAyahNo=23&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=1">18:23 (link)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic">أخرج ابن المنذرعن مجاهد، أن قريشاً اجتمعت فقالوا: " يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، فما هذا الدين الذي جئت به؟ قال: هذا دين جئت به من الرحمن. فقالوا: إنا لا نعرف الرحمن، إلا رحمن اليمامة - يعنون مسيلمة الكذاب - ثم كاتبوا اليهود فقالوا: قد نبغ فينا رجل يزعم أنه نبي، وقد رغب عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، ويزعم أن الذي جاء به من الرحمن. قلنا: لا نعرف الرحمن إلا رحمن اليمامة، وهو أمين لا يخون.. وفيّ لا يغدر.. صدوق لا يكذب، وهو في حسب وثروة من قومه، فاكتبوا إلينا بأشياء نسأله عنها. فاجتمعت يهود فقالوا: إن هذا لوصفه وزمانه الذي يخرج فيه. فكتبوا إلى قريش: أن سلوه عن أمر أصحاب الكهف، وعن ذي القرنين، وعن الروح. فإن يكن الذي أتاكم به من الرحمن، فإن الرحمن هو الله عز وجل، وإن يكن من رحمن اليمامة فينقطع. فلما أتى ذلك قريشاً أتى الظفر في أنفسها فقالوا: يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائك... فحدثنا عن أمر أصحاب الكهف وذي القرنين والروح. قال: ائتوني غداً. ولم يستثن، فمكث جبريل عنه ما شاء الله لا يأتيه، ثم أتاه فقال: سألوني عن أشياء لم يكن عندي بها علم فأجيب حتى شق ذلك عليّ. قال: ألم ترنا لا ندخل بيتاً فيه كلب ولا صورة؟ - وكان في البيت جرو كلب - ونزلت { ولا تقولن لشيء إني فاعل ذلك غداً إلا أن يشاء الله واذكر ربك إذا نسيت وقل عسى أن يهدين ربي لأقرب من هذا رشداً } من علم الذي سألتموني عنه أن يأتي قبل غد؟ ونزل ما ذكر من أصحاب الكهف ونزل<b>{ <span class="TextAyah">ويسألونك عن الروح...</span> }</b> [الإسراء: 85] الآية ".</span></p>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic">Ibn Mundhir narrated from Mujahid that the pagans of Quraysh gathered and said to Muhammad, "You have deviated from the religion of our ancestors. Where did you get this new religion from?" Muhammad replied, "This religion is from Rahman (i.e. another name of Allah)." The Quraysh responded, "We only know Rahman  from Yemen." They associated Musaylmah Kadhab with it, who was another person claiming false prophethood during Muhammad's era and also claimed his new religion was from al-Rahman, i.e., God. Then, the Quraysh wrote to the Jews, informing them that a person had emerged among them claiming to be a prophet, having abandoned the religion of their ancestors ... The Jews replied, "Ask him three questions about the Ashab-e-Kuhf (the People of the Cave), Dhulqarnain, and the spirit. If he can answer these questions, then he is from Rahman, who is God. But if Rahman is from Yemen, he will not be able to answer them." The Quraysh became pleased with this and said to Muhammad, "If you have already abandoned the religion of our ancestors, then tell us about the Ashab-e-Kuhf, Dhulqarnain, and the spirit." Muhammad told them, "Come to me tomorrow (and I will answer)." However, Muhammad forgot to say Insha-Allah (i.e., if Allah wills). Gabriel appeared to him after only 15 days. Muhammad said to Gabriel, "The Quraysh came to me and asked me about certain things (as a test of my prophethood), but I didn't know the answers. I was in a very difficult situation during this period." Gabriel replied, "Have you not seen that we (i.e., the angels) do not enter a house with a dog or a picture? There was a puppy in your house, and you were not aware of it." Consequently, the following revelation was sent down: "[... and do not say of anything, 'Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,' except (when adding), 'If Allah wills.' Quran 18:22-24]" (i.e., the puppy entered his house while he forgot to say Insha-Allah).<br></span></p>

<p>The actual situation was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muhammad neither knew the answers to the three questions nor was he in contact with any Allah or angel.</li>
<li>Consequently, Muhammad began seeking information from others, which took him 15 days to gather.</li>
<li>However, Muhammad made an excuse that he was unable to answer the questions as he had forgotten to say Insha-Allah (if God wills). And he claimed that a puppy entering his house prevented Gabriel from delivering the answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are reasons to question the validity of this excuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad went outside of his house during those 15 days to relieve himself and pray in the mosques. Why didn't Gabriel come to him there?</li>
<li>How was it that the purity of a great angel like Gabriel could not overcome the presence of a small puppy?</li>
<li>Why couldn't the purity of Muhammad himself overcome the impurity of a small puppy?</li>
<li>What about the two angels, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiraman_Katibin"><em>Kiraman Katibin</em></a>, who are said to sit on the shoulders of every person, recording their deeds? Are Kiraman Katibin also expelled from the house by dogs, allowing one to commit sins inside without being recorded?</li>
<li>Furthermore, if dogs are truly considered impure, why did the "people of the cave أصحاب الكهف" take a dog along with them?</li>
</ul>
<p>In simple terms, it appears that Muhammad used the puppy as a scapegoat for his inability to answer the questions the next day.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId949643"></a>Muhammad's Allah didn't know about the Panting of dogs </h2>
<p>After the incident of Muhammad's test, he continued to present dogs in a bad light. </p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/7.176">7:176</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So his example is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants. That is the example of the people who denied Our signs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse compares the actions of those who deny the signs of Allah to the behavior of a dog, stating that if you chase him or leave him, he pants. This analogy raises questions about the connection between panting and accepting or rejecting the message.</p>
<p>Muhammad's Allah seemingly did not acknowledge that panting is a natural process for dogs to regulate their body temperature through evaporation, similar to how humans cool down through sweating. However, using panting as a symbol of rejecting the message appears to be an illogical and erroneous comparison.</p>
<p>Sweating, a natural bodily process in humans, does not imply rejection of a message. Therefore, it is puzzling why the panting of dogs would be attributed to message rejection.</p>
<p>This example is highly flawed and does not align with the wisdom one would expect from a divine entity characterized as All-Wise.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId833021"></a>Orders of killing all Dogs in Medina</h2>
<p>The situation in Medina after Muhammad's arrival unfolded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad had already declared dogs to be impure and discouraged their presence as pets inside homes, as it would invalidate prayers.</li>
<li>However, the people of the desert, whose livelihoods revolved around livestock, cherished their dogs, considering them highly valuable. Consequently, there were roaming dogs within the city of Medina.</li>
<li>The Jewish community in Medina was aware of the incident in which Muhammad used the excuse of a puppy in his house to explain the delay in Gabriel's arrival with revelation for 15 days. Simultaneously, they observed that Muslims from the Aus and Khazraj tribes in Medina kept dogs in close proximity to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears that Muhammad grew displeased with the behavior of the Aus and Khazraj tribes, who disregarded his explicit orders to remove dogs from their houses. This might have been a motivating factor behind Muhammad eventually issuing a command to kill all dogs in Medina.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId567896"></a>The Hints of Human Drama in the Revelations Regarding the Killing of Dogs</h2>
<p>The Evolution of Sharia Ruling on the Killing of Dogs in Four Stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Stage: Initially, Muhammad commanded the killing of all dogs, regardless of their roles or appearances.</li>
<li>2nd Stage: In response to public outcry against the mass killing of dogs, then Allah (i.e. Muhammad) revised the ruling, allowing people to keep dogs for hunting and livestock protection while maintaining the directive to kill all other dogs.</li>
<li>3rd Stage: However, further protests led to another revision, whereby the Divine Allah rescinded the order to kill all other dogs, except those with black coloration. In this stage, black dogs were deemed as associated with devils.</li>
<li>4th Stage: Continuing opposition to the killing of black dogs prompted yet another revision. Then Allah (i.e. Muhammad) reversed the ruling once more, abolishing the killing of all black dogs, except for those that were jet-black with two spots on their eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout these four stages, the Sharia ruling regarding the killing of dogs underwent transformations due to the protests and concerns raised by the people.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1572">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1572</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill (all) dogs, and we carried out this order so much so that we also kill the dog coming with a woman from the desert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2845">Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2845</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Were dogs not a species of creature I should command that they all be killed; but kill every pure black one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:510a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 510a</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Dharr reported: The Messenger of 'Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguishes it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as you are asking me, and he said: <strong><em>The black dog is a devil</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1572">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1572</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill (all) dogs ... Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) forbade their killing. He (the Prophet further) said: It is your duty (to kill) the jet-black (dog) having<strong> <em>two spots (on the eyes), for it is a devil</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an Intriguing Contradiction in the Sharia Rulings on Dogs.</p>
<p>The contradiction becomes apparent when considering that if the devil was not present in dogs other than the jet-black ones with two spots on their eyes, why did Muhammad/Allah initially decree the killing of all other innocent dogs who did not possess any demonic qualities?</p>
<p>It is crucial to remember that a "divine revelation" should not be subject to trial and error but rather should embody the flawless wisdom of an All-Wise God from its very inception.</p>
<p>When examining the evolution of Islamic orders regarding alcohol, we observe a progression from leniency to strictness in three stages, reflecting an understanding of human psychology. Initially, praying while intoxicated was prohibited, followed by a complete prohibition of alcohol, and finally, the introduction of 80 lashes as punishment.</p>
<p>However, the case of dogs follows an opposite trajectory—orders transitioned from strict to lenient. This means that the initial decree to kill all dogs went against human psychology, and subsequent modifications were made due to the protests of people who vehemently opposed the killing of their pet dogs and advocated for the retention of dogs for hunting and guarding purposes.</p>
<p>Muhammad/Allah was indeed compelled to change the orders due to the intense opposition and protest from people who were unwilling to part with their beloved canine companions. This sentiment of resistance is evident in the hadith:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1573a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1573a</a>: </p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Mughaffal reported: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered the killing of dogs and then said: <em><strong>what is the trouble with them (i.e. Why were the people protesting)? How are dogs a nuisance to them (the citizens of Medina)?</strong></em> He then permitted the keeping of dogs for hunting and (the protection of) herds.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In conclusion, a divine revelation should be grounded in divine wisdom rather than relying on a trial-and-error approach.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId213799"></a>The Hints of Human Drama within the Revelations (Part 2: The Influence of Superstitions on Muhammad's Beliefs)</h2>
<p>In various parts of the world, the belief that encountering a black cat is a sign of bad luck prevails. Muslims, however, reject this notion and often mock Hindus and others who adhere to such superstitions. Look at this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121107043021/http://shaheedeislam.com/aap-k-masaul-or-un-ka-hal/ap-k-masail-or-unka-hal-jild-1/1267-toham-parasti">Fatwa</a>, where the Mufti is asserting that believing in such superstitions is a sign of ignorance.</p>
<p>Muslims are justified in their dismissal of this superstition, as there is no inherent malevolence associated with either black cats or their act of crossing paths.</p>
<p>However, it is noteworthy that Muhammad himself was influenced by superstitions prevalent in the ignorant Arab society of his time. One such superstition pertained to the black ram, which Muhammad adopted due to the customs and beliefs of his society.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1967">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1967</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded that <em><strong>a ram with black legs, black belly and black (circles) round the eyes</strong></em> should be brought to him, so that he should sacrifice it. He said to 'A'isha: Give me the large knife, and then said: Sharpen it on a stone. She did that. He then took it (the knife) and then the ram; he placed it on the ground and then sacrificed it</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Muhammad took the prevailing superstition surrounding the color black a step further by associating it with black dogs, resulting in more severe implications. While other cultures limited their belief in black cats as bad omens, Muhammad declared that black dogs were not only ill-fated signs but considered devils themselves.</p>
<p>According to Muhammad's teachings, the presence of a black dog could disrupt prayers or even sever the connection to the divine if they were in the vicinity or present within a household. Such beliefs were taken to an extreme extent, with Muhammad advocating for the killing of all black dogs.</p>
<p>By intertwining superstition with his religious teachings, Muhammad reinforced the negative perception of black dogs, exacerbating the superstitions surrounding them and promoting their harm. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:510a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 510a</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of 'Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguish it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as you are asking me, and he said: <em><strong>The black dog is a devil</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Dear Muslims,</p>
<p>When you look at this black dog, do you perceive it as a devil deserving to be killed? Alternatively, do you recognize it as a loving, caring, and loyal friend to this baby?</p>
<p>I urge you to tap into the humanity within you to make a compassionate and informed decision. Trust in your innate sense of compassion, as it will always guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>It is essential to remember that the historical orders attributed to Muhammad, commanding the killing of all black dogs or black dogs with two spots on their eyes, still exist today. Consider carefully whether you truly believe in implementing such directives in the present time.</p>
<p>Let empathy and reason guide your actions, ensuring that you treat all living beings with kindness and respect.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId145170"></a>Questionable Fabrication: Separating the Puppy Excuse from Gabriel's Delay in Muslim Accounts</h2>
<p>Muslims claim that the incident of the puppy didn't happen during Muhammad's test in Mecca, but later in Medina. They present the following tradition by 'Aisha:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2104a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2104a</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A'isha reported that Gabriel (peace be upon him) made a promise with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to come at a definite hour; that hour came but he did not visit him. And there was in his hand (in the hand of Allah's Apostle) a staff. He threw it from his hand and said: Never has Allah or His messengers (angels) ever broken their promise. Then he cast a glance (and by chance) found a puppy under his cot <strong>and said: 'A'isha, when did this dog enter here? She said: By Allah, I don't know </strong>He then commanded and it was turned out. Then Gabriel came and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: You promised me and I waited for you, but you did not come, whereupon he said: It was the dog in your house which prevented me (to come), for we (angels) do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Muhammad's explanation that the presence of a puppy prevented Gabriel from visiting him for 15 days appears to be a highly implausible excuse. As a result, it seems that Muslims attempted to disassociate the puppy incident from Muhammad's inability to answer the questions during that time. This intention becomes evident through the creation of fabricated Hadiths aimed at separating the dog's involvement from Muhammad's 15-day struggle.</p>
<p>The fabrication becomes even more apparent when we examine the <strong>contradictory</strong> Hadith attributed to 'Aisha herself. I<strong>n this Hadith, she denies witnessing such an incident unfold before her eyes </strong>(although in the first tradition, she is present on the spot and witnesses the incident directly).</p>
<p>This raises doubts about the authenticity of the accounts that aim to isolate the puppy incident from Gabriel's delay, suggesting a deliberate effort to alter the narrative and mitigate Muhammad's inability to answer the questions during that critical period.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2106f">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2106f</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Talha Ansari reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture or portraits. I came to 'A'isha and said to her: This is a news that I have received that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had said: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture or a dog, (and further added)<em><strong> <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">whether she had heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) making a mention of it. She said: No (I did not hear this myself)</span>, </strong></em>but I narrate to you what I saw him doing. I bear testimony to the fact that he (the Holy Prophet) set out for an expedition. I took a carpet and screened the door with it. When he (the Holy Prophet) came back he saw that carpet and I perceived signs of disapproval on his face. He pulled it until it was torn or it was cut (into pieces) and he said: God has not commanded us to clothe stones and clay. We cut it (the curtain) and prepared two pillowa out of it by stuffing them with the fibre of date-palms and he (the Holy Prophet) did not find fault with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon examining the contradictory traditions present in Sahih Muslim, a clear 180-degree contradiction emerges. This raises several logical possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first tradition could have been fabricated by later Islamic apologists.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the second tradition may have been fabricated by later Islamic apologists.</li>
<li>It is also plausible that both traditions were fabricated by later Islamic apologists.</li>
</ol>
<p>These contradictory traditions strongly suggest that the later Islamic apologists had a motive for concealing or altering certain aspects of the narrative. It is highly probable that their intention was to obscure or downplay Muhammad's excuse of the puppy's presence hindering Gabriel's entry into his house, which ultimately resulted in Muhammad's failure to provide timely answers.</p>
<p>The fabrication of these traditions serves as evidence that later Islamic apologists aimed to manipulate the narrative, possibly to shield or downplay Muhammad's shortcomings during the incident.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId277709"></a>2nd Apologetic Excuse: Traditions of Ali and Maimuna also prove that this incident happened in Medina and not in Mecca</h2>
<p>Islam algologists also bring the following 2 traditions:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/ahmad:845">Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 845:</a></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">It was narrated that ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I used to come to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) every morning. If he cleared his throat, I would enter, and if he remained silent, I would not enter. He came out to me (on one occasion) and said: “Something happened last night. I heard some movement in the house, then I saw Jibreel (عليه السلام). I said: ‘What prevented you from entering the house?` He said: “In the house there is a dog.` I went in and I saw a puppy belonging to al-Hasan beneath a chair of ours. He [Jibreel] said: “The angels do not enter a house if there are three things in it: a dog or an image or a person who is junub.`</div>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2105">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2105:</a></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Maimuna reported that one morning Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was silent with grief. Maimuna said: Allah's Messenger, I find a change in your mood today. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Gabriel had promised me that he would meet me tonight, but he did not meet me. By Allah, he never broke his promises, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) spent the day in this sad (mood). Then it occurred to him that there had been a puppy under their cot. He commanded and it was turned out. He then took some water in his hand and sprinkled it at that place. When it was evening Gabriel met him and he said to him: you promised me that you would meet me the previous night. He said: Yes, but we do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture. </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>These 2 more Ahadith are not proving the point of view of Islam apologists (i.e. this incident happened in Medina), but:</p>
<ul>
<li>These 2 more Ahadith are also proving the presence of the FABRICATION Factory of Ahadith by Islam apologists.</li>
<li>Not only these 2 more Ahadith are <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>contradicting</strong></span> each other, but they are also contradicting the hadith of 'Aisha too. Logically, this incident can happen with either one of them among 'Aisha, 'Ali and Maimuna. Thus, it is again proof of the fabrication of Ahadith in order to hide the real story. </li>
</ul>
<p>There was no limit to the fabrication of Ahadith by Islam apologists. The whole FACTORY was present there for this purpose. </p>
<p>We request the readers to read our 2 articles on Muslims deception of Fabricating Hadiths:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="114-muslim-hadith-fabrication-factories-to-defend-islam.html">The Hadith Fabrication Factory in order to save the honour of Islam</a>: There were 131 traditions (including Sahih Ahadith), which were present in Hadith books, which claimed Ishaq was the son who was sacrificed. But later Hadith Fabrication Factory by Islam apologists fabricated 133 traditions (including Sahih Ahadith) in order to counter the first Statement and they claimed it was Ismael who was sacrificed. Through this, they wanted to give preference to Muhammad and his ancestor (Ismael) over Jews and their ancestor Ishaq. </li>
<li><a href="../the-unreliability-of-hadith-and-ilm-ul-hadith/295-the-lie-of-moon-splitting-ample-proof-that-hadiths-cannot-be-trusted.html">The Lie of Moon Splitting: Ample Proof that Hadiths Cannot Be Trusted</a>: There are many of so-called Sahih Hadiths which claim that Muhammad split the moon into two in front of the Meccan Pagans. But all these lies caught red-handed while the Quran itself became a witness that Allah/Muhammad failed to show even a tiniest of any miracle in front of the Meccan Pagans. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId692962"></a>Conclusion:</h2>

<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">
<p>In conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unfortunate dogs were unjustly made scapegoats for Muhammad's failure to answer the questions during those 15 days.</li>
<li>Throughout the 1400 years of Islamic history, they were despised and held responsible for a crime they were not even guilty of. </li>
<li>And perhaps the most unfortunate issue is, still today 1.5 billion people HATE dogs due to Muhammad/Allah. </li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we were to assume that the incident with the puppy was unrelated to Muhammad's inability to answer the questions, it remains impossible to accept these Sharia Orders as a "divine revelation" from an All-Wise and All-Knowing entity. These orders are characterized by cruelty, superstitions, and a trial-and-error approach that changes multiple times in response to people's anger and protests.</p>
<p>Even without the explicit order to kill dogs, Muhammad's claim that black dogs are devils is inherently illogical, contradicting the natural sense of compassion within humanity.</p>
<p>These aspects are not indicative of divine revelation but rather reflect the intricate complexities and dynamics of human drama.</p>

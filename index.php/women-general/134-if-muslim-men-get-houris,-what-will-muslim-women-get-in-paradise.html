<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:15"><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:181">Do you know that there is absolutely no mention of any Houris in the thousands of pages of the Old Testament and the New Testament? It was Muhammad who later made it all up himself.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:247">By the time of Muhammad (i.e., 7th century AD), the stories of many religions and cultures had reached Arabia. Muhammad mixed all of those stories from different religions and <span class="citation-0">cultures in order to form his new religion of Islam. For example:</span></p>
<ul data-sourcepos="9:1-12:0">
<li data-sourcepos="9:1-9:88"><span class="citation-0 citation-end-0">Muhammad took the basic idea of his new religion from Judaism</span> and Christianity.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="10:1-10:220">At the same time, Muhammad also introduced the Hajj rituals of pagan Arabs into Islamic Sharia. This suited his new religion and gave it strength by connecting with pagan Arabs through the continuation of Hajj rituals.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="11:1-12:0">Muhammad also took many practices from Zoroastrians, such as praying five times a day, wearing head coverings during prayers, the Ascension to Heaven, ritual purification before prayer, and the Bridge over Hell (Islamic Pul-Sirat). (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210316190807/https://lampofislam.wordpress.com/2020/09/01/zoroastrian-influence-on-traditional-islam/">link</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Muhammad also took the concept of houris from Zoroastrianism (<a href="https://darbyblion.com/?p=2334">link</a>). This helped him to entice men into joining his new religion and also to wage wars for him in the greed of getting houris by becoming martyrs.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId105003"></a>Question: If Muslim men receive Houris in Paradise, then what will pious Muslim women receive in Paradise?</h2>
<p>The Quran remains silent on what pious Muslim women will receive in Paradise, despite its numerous descriptions of Houris for men. However, a Hadith suggests that women will be reunited with their last husbands as their companions in Paradise.</p>
<p>This Hadith is as under:</p>
<p>Imaam al-Tabaraani said in his book al-Mu’jam al-Awsat, 3/275:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>خطب معاوية بن أبى سفيان أم الدرداء بعد وفاة أبي الدرداء فقالت أم الدرداء إني سمعت أبا الدرداء يقول سمعت رسول الله  صلى الله عليه وسلم  يقول أيما امرأة توفي عنها زوجها فتزوجت بعده فهي لآخر أزواجها وما كنت لأختارك على أبي الدرداء </p>
<p>Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan proposed marriage to Umm al-Darda’ after Abu’l-Darda’ had passed away. Umm al-Darda’ said: I heard Abu’l-Darda’ say: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say:<strong><em> any woman whose husband dies and she marries someone else after him, she will be with the last of her husbands (in paradise), and I would not choose you over Abu’l-Darda’</em></strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even this reward for women in paradise is also problematic, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Hadith ultimately stops a poor widow Muslim woman from remarrying in this world due to the fear of not being able to reunite with her deceased husband in paradise.</li>
<li>What if she loves someone else but is forced to marry a person (for example, an old man) whom she never loved throughout her married life?</li>
<li>Even if we assume that a woman in this world will also become beautiful in paradise (like Houris) and remain a virgin whom her husband can deflower every time, it is still a reward for the man and not for the woman.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: There is another tradition that claims women will get their favorite husband in paradise, but that Hadith is considered 'extremely weak' by Muslim authorities (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10053/will-men-in-paradise-have-intercourse-with-al-hoor-aliyn">link</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, both the Quran and Ahadith are completely silent about the fate of a female believer who dies unmarried or was married to a man who will not enter Paradise.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId230917"></a>Why are women denied the opportunity to enjoy 72 male Houris?</h2>
<p>The concept of physical pleasures, including sex, drinking, and eating, being available in paradise was introduced by Allah/Muhammad. As such, men will be granted 72 virgin Houris to indulge in physical intimacy whenever they desire.</p>
<p>While sex may or may not be a factor, women undeniably require <strong>Companionship and Affection</strong>.</p>
<p>One wonders what harm could come from providing women with the companionship, affection and love of attractive young males (غلمان), or male Houris? Women would surely relish their company and might even experience love through sexual interaction with them. After all, love is an integral aspect of sexual intimacy, and women are known to appreciate it.</p>
<p>Instead, women are left waiting for their husbands, who will be preoccupied with their 72 Houris. This raises the question: Why should women not be endowed with the unique ability to savour the love and companionship of 100 male Houris simultaneously, just as men will purportedly possess the enhanced strength of a hundred? </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2536">Jami' at-Tirmidhi 2536:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (s.a.w) said: "The believer shall be given in paradise such and such strength in intercourse ." it was said: "O Messenger of Allah! And will he able to do that?" He said: "<strong>He will be given the strength of a hundred.</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This begs the question: Why should women be subjected to double standards when it comes to sexual pleasure and intimacy in the afterlife? Instead of receiving equal treatment, women are expected to patiently await their spouses, who'll presumably be preoccupied with their 72 Houris. It's worth noting that women also naturally crave sexual satisfaction and experience profound love during this act.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId510828"></a>Threatening women to obey their husbands through curses and mocking by Houris</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We all know about Islamic brainwashing: if women don't allow their husbands to rape them, then angels curse them the whole night. But this is not the only curse that women receive; they are also cursed and mocked by the army of Houris if their husbands are merely annoyed.</span></p>

<p>The Prophet said, "No woman annoys her husband in this world except that his wife among the Al-Huril-Ain says, 'Do not annoy him, may Allah destroy you, he is only like a guest with us, soon he will part from you for us.'"</p>

</blockquote>
<p>However, in contrast, if a Muslim husband annoys his wife, there are no male Houris present to curse and mock him. Even if a Muslim husband beats his wife brutally, he has full permission for that, and no male Houris are present to curse him. That is why, even the Sahaba (male companions) of Muhammad used to beat their wives even more brutally than non-Muslims, but Muhammad never threatened them with the curse of angels or any male Houris.</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5825/">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5825:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rifa`a divorced his wife whereupon `AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. `Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil (and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her <strong>a green spot</strong> (bruise) on her skin caused by severe beating).<strong> It was the habit of ladies to support each other</strong>, so when Allah's Apostle came, <strong>`Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women (i.e. even the non-Muslim men don't beat their non-believing women so brutally)</strong>.<strong> Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many Sahaba, including Zubair Ibn 'Awam, who was among the ten most esteemed companions, were known for beating their wives. Despite this, they were never threatened with curses from angels or the presence of male Houris. Why the double standards?</p>

<blockquote>

And it is given to them in likeness.<strong> </strong>And they will have therein <strong><em>purified spouses</em></strong>, and they will abide therein eternally<strong>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Islam apologists attempt to deceive by claiming that this verse refers to Muslim women of this world, who will be wives of men in Paradise. However, this interpretation is incorrect, as the Arabic word Azwaj (أَزْوَٰجٌ) is used, and in previous verses <a href="https://quranx.com/44.54">44:54</a> and <a href="https://quranx.com/52.20">52:20</a>, the same word is used by the Quran to refer to the marriage of Houris with men in Paradise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the number of pious Muslim women is fewer than pious Muslim men, as most of them will be in Hell, according to Muhammad <a href="https://bewley.virtualave.net/bukhari4.html#6">Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 6, Hadith 298</a>). Therefore, every pious man in Paradise cannot have multiple wives if Muslim women of this world are meant here. The condition of multiple wives for pious Muslim men can only be fulfilled in the case of Houris.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Surah Baqarah was revealed during the Meccan period, while the following Hadith indicates that until the Medinan period, there was no verse in the Quran regarding women in Paradise.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3211">Jami` at-Tirmidhi, Hadith 3211</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Umm 'Umarah Al-Ansariyyah: that she came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: "<strong><em>I do not see but that everything is for the men, and I do not see anything being mentioned for the women.</em></strong>" So this Ayah was revealed: Verily men and women who have come to submission, men and women who are believers, men and women who are devout, truthful men and truthful women, men and women with endurance, men and women who are modest, men and women who give alms, men and women who observe fasting, men and women who guard their private parts, and those men and women who remember God a great deal, for them God <strong>has forgiveness and a great reward</strong>. (Verse <a href="https://quranx.com/33.35">33:35</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>She is an Ansariyyah woman, which proves that until that time in the Medinan period, nothing had been revealed in the Quran about women in Paradise. Moreover, Surah Ahzab (i.e., verse 33:35) was also revealed in Medina.</p>
<p>Therefore, it also proves that the verse of Surah Baqarah (<a href="https://quranx.com/2.25">2:25</a>) refers to Houris and not to Muslim women of this world, while Surah Baqarah was revealed earlier in the Meccan period.</p>
<p>Additionally, Umm Salama (Muhammad's wife) also noted the same thing - that nothing had been revealed in the Quran about women (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/170975/the-woman-companion-because-of-whom-the-verse-3335-was-revealed">link</a>). She also wed Muhammad only in Medina.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(6) Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.57">4:57</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا ۖ لَّهُمْ فِيهَآ<strong><em> أَزْوَٰجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ</em></strong> ۖ وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِلًّا ظَلِيلًا</p>
<p>But those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. For them therein are <em><strong>purified spouses</strong></em>, and We will admit them to deepening shade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3254">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3254</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The first batch (of people) <em><strong>who will enter Paradise</strong></em> will be (glittering) like the full moon, and the batch next to them will be (glittering) like the most brilliant star in the sky. Their hearts will be as if the heart of a single man, for they will have neither enmity nor jealousy amongst themselves; <em><strong>everyone will have two (to 72) wives (depending of their status) from the houris</strong>, (who will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the bones and the flesh</em>."</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>(7) Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/43.70">43:70</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ٱدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْجَنَّةَ أَنتُمْ وَ<strong>أَزْوَٰجُكُمْ </strong>تُحْبَرُونَ</p>
<p>Enter Paradise, you and your spouses delighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Surah Zukhruf was also revealed in Mecca, and we know nothing was revealed in Quran for women there. Thus, again Houris are meant here from spouses and not the worldly wives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(8) Quran: <a href="https://quranx.com/56.35?context=3">56:35-37</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَٰهُنَّ إِنشَآءًفَجَعَلْنَٰهُنَّ أَبْكَارًاعُرُبًا أَتْرَابًا</p>
<p>Indeed, We [We] have produced them (into) a creation, And We have made them virgins, loving and of matching age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Islam apologists try to claim this verse is not about Houris but about pious Muslim women of this world. But they are again refuted by the fact that this Surah 56 (i.e. Surah Waqiya) was also revealed in Mecca. Moreover, see the following hadith.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the previous verses have no mention of Muslim women of this world but they only mention Houris in paradise (see Verse <a href="https://quranx.com/56.22?context=3">56:22-23</a>). This also proves that verses <a href="https://quranx.com/56.35?context=3">56:35-37</a> are not for pious Muslim women of this world, but about Houris.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(9) Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/55.56">55:56</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>فِيهِنَّ قَٰصِرَٰتُ ٱلطَّرْفِ لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلَا جَآنٌّ</p>
<p>In the midst of these shall be maidens with modest, restrained glances; maidens whom no man or jinn has ever touched before.</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(10) Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/78.33?context=3">78:31-33</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>اِنَّ لِلۡمُتَّقِیۡنَ مَفَازًا حَدَآئِقَ وَ اَعۡنَابًا <strong>وَّکَوَاعِبَ</strong> اَتۡرَابًا</p>
<p>Verily for the Righteous there will be a fulfilment of (the heart's) desires; Gardens enclosed, and grapevines; And <em><strong>full-breasted voluptuous girls [i.e. Houris]</strong></em> of equal age</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of this verse (<a href="https://archive.org/details/TafsirIbnKathirVolume0110English_201702">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word (<strong>کَوَاعِبَ</strong>) has been interpreted to refer to <em><strong>"fully developed" or "round" breasts</strong></em> ... they meant by this that the breasts of these girls will be fully rounded and not sagging, because they will be virgins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quran explicitly mentions at least 10 times that men will receive beautiful Houris in Paradise. However, there is not a single verse that describes what women will receive in Paradise. This raises a question about the inspiration and motivation for women. Why does the Quran only describe the benefits for men and neglect to provide any such description for women?</p>
<p>Apologists argue that the mention of Houris serves to inspire men towards achieving Jannah. However, this response creates a double standard since it fails to address the lack of inspiration for women. If the purpose of describing Houris is truly to inspire both genders equally, then why did the Quran not include similar descriptions of male companions for women?</p>
<p>This discrepancy highlights a fundamental flaw in the argument that the Quran treats both men and women equally. It appears that the Quran caters primarily to the desires and aspirations of men, leaving women without equal representation or consideration.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId490174"></a>Quran and Ahadith are full of mention of the BEAUTY of Houris, but both are empty about the beauty of Muslim women in paradise</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">While the Quranic passages analyzed earlier highlight the alluring nature of Houris, there are no corresponding verses that extol the virtues of earthly women who will join their spouses in Paradise. Similarly, Ahadith accounts that detail the attributes of Houris are abundant, yet there are no parallel narratives that celebrate the beauty and grace of female believers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3254">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3254</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "...<em>every man will have two (to 72) wives from the houris, <strong>(who will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the bones and the flesh</strong></em><strong>.</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2796">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 2796</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "...<em> And if an houri from Paradise appeared to the people of the earth, she would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world and whatever is in it</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are hundreds of Ahadith recorded by Muslim scholars that describe the beauty of Houris, including their vaginas. For instance, one hadith states that all Houris will have libidinous vaginas, while Muslim men will have an eternal erection in their penises. </p>
<p>Please read the following article at <a href="https://wikiislam.net">WikiIslam.net</a> for details: <a href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Houri_%28Heavenly_Virgin%29">Houri (Heavenly Virgin)</a></p>
<p>Moreover, Maulana Tariq Jamil of Pakistan is known for his speeches that elaborate on these Ahadith, describing the beauty of Houris and how Muslim men will deflower them repeatedly, as well as the length and enjoyment of the sexual acts, and how they will continue for eternity.</p>
<p>In contrast, both the Quran and Ahadith lack mentions of the beauty of Muslim women in paradise. Islamic apologists justify this discrepancy by arguing that the emphasis on Houris is meant to inspire Muslim men. However, this raises questions about inspiring Muslim women.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that there aren't any verses in the Quran that encourage men to treat their wives well by promising them that their wives will be even more beautiful than Houris in paradise, and that they will receive their wives' companionship there if they treat them well.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Some scholars have attempted to fill this gap by claiming that Muslim women will be more beautiful than Houris in paradise. However, these claims are not supported by any authentic Quranic verses or Hadith. Instead, they appear to be based on personal interpretations and biases. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId38306"></a>Islam Apologists: It is in the nature of man to wish to have multiple women for sex, but women don't wish to have multiple partners</h2>
<p>Islamic Apologists argue that it's innate for men to desire multiple female partners for sexual gratification, yet women supposedly don't share this inclination. If this argument holds water, then shouldn't it follow that women naturally want to showcase their physical attractiveness and seek male admiration? And wouldn't it make sense for Islam to accommodate this aspect of human nature, just as it purportedly caters to men's desires?</p>
<p>However, the reality is that Islam restricts women's expression of their natural instincts while catering exclusively to men's wants. Women inherently require more time, attention, love, and affection from their partners. But Islam suppresses these fundamental aspects of women's nature by permitting polygamy and also allowing Muslim men to do sex with dozens of slave girls, leaving wives to wait patiently for their husbands to finish indulging in the company of 72 celestial virgins.</p>
<p>This oppressive treatment of women under Islam extends beyond this mortal realm; in paradise, Muslim husbands will allegedly be preoccupied with their heavenly brides, leaving their earthly spouses to languish in neglect. Why does Allah seemingly disregard the natural needs and desires of women, both in this life and the next?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId941044"></a>Islam apologists: The term Hūr refers both to pure men and pure women</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists have struggled to provide equal paradisaical rewards for Muslim women as they have for Muslim men, particularly regarding the latter's sexual activities with Houris. In response, some modern apologists have attempted to reinterpret the Quranic term Hūr as referring to both virtuous men and women.</p>
<p>However, this explanation won't suffice, as the Quran explicitly states in verses <a href="https://quranx.com/55.70?context=6">55:70-76</a> that these Houris are untouched by any man or jinn before them, thereby implying a feminine gender. Furthermore, the concept of Houris is consistently presented as a reward for faithful men, with no mention of a similar reward for women.</p>
<p>Muhammad's teachings on Houris, as recorded in various Hadiths, further reinforce the notion that Houris are female and exist primarily as sexual objects for male believers. The question remains whether modern Islamic apologists truly believe they possess a deeper understanding of the Quran than Muhammad himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId365664"></a>Islam apologists: The concept of Houris is only allegorical and not literal</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists argue that the reference to Houris should be understood allegorically, rather than literally. For example, <a title="Muhammad Asad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Asad">Muhammad Asad</a>, a modern Islamic scholar, cites Quran 32:17 as evidence that the idea of Houris is meant to symbolize spiritual rewards rather than physical pleasure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/32.17">32:17</a>: No one knows what delights of the eyes are kept hidden for them as a reward for their deeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p>Muhammad (the prophet of Islam) knew Quran better than <a title="Muhammad Asad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Asad">Muhammad Asad</a>, but he never took the concept of Houris to be allegorical, but totally literal in his Ahadith where he mentioned them as beautiful sexual objects. So, who is then <a title="Muhammad Asad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Asad">Muhammad Asad</a> to refute the understanding of Muhammad (the prophet of Islam)?</p>
<p>Even Quran is itself clear that it is not allegorical but literal when it describes the marriage with Houris, who had never been touched by any man or jinn before. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It was Muhammad, who</span><span class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU" style="font-size: 1rem;"> just made it all up</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> to entice men into joining his new religion and to wage wars for him in greed of getting houris by becoming martyrs. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Therefore, Muhammad didn't care much about the Muslim women in paradise, but he was only interested in telling what men will get in paradise if they accept Islam and get martyrdom in this life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In fact, Muhammad told in Ahadith that normal Muslim men will get 2 Houris, but martyrs will get 72 Houris:</span></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated"><a href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:1663">Jami` at-Tirmidhi, Hadith 1663</a>:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">Narrated Al-Miqdam bin Ma'diykarib: That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "There are six things with Allah for the martyr. He is forgiven with the first flow of blood (he suffers), he is shown his place in Paradise, he is protected from punishment in the grave, secured from the greatest terror, the crown of dignity is placed upon his head - and its gems are better than the world and what is in it - <em><strong>he is married to seventy two wives along Al-Huril-'Ayn of Paradise</strong></em>, and he may intercede for seventy of his close relatives." [Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad was indeed a smart and clever person, and a master of religious brainwashing by fabricating stories. Unfortunately, millions of innocent people had to pay the price of the smartness of Muhammad through their blood. </p>     </div>

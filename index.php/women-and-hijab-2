&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slave Bazaars in Saudi Arab in 1964, with slave girls with naked breasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Saudi Arabia had to ban slavery in 1962 due to the pressure of the Western world, still unofficially it continued. This documentary was made in 1964 where you can see slave girls with naked breasts are sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;video width=&quot;704&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; style=&quot;width: 704px; height: 528px;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/slave_bazaar_saudia.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how is it possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;The Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, as Islam prohibited Slave Women from wearing the Hijab or even covering their naked breasts in public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;According to Islam, the Hijab was considered a privilege and honor exclusively for free Muslim women, while slave women were not allowed to wear it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat slave women if they ever by mistake wore the Hijab, and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by wearing the Hijab. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, it is worth noting that Muhammad specified that the 'Awrah (nakedness) of slave women should be from the navel to the knee, while their chests remained uncovered. This meant that there were thousands of slave women who appeared publicly, even in the presence of Muhammad, with their breasts exposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;Understanding these historical facts about Islam could lead Muslim women today to reconsider the necessity of wearing the Hijab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Table of Contents:&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id=&quot;mozToc&quot;&gt;&lt;!--mozToc h1 1 h2 2 h3 3 h4 4 h5 5 h6 6--&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId895120&quot;&gt;Muhammad revived the old custom of Arabia, where only high-status women were allowed to take a Hijab&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId434974&quot;&gt;In the pre-Islamic era, neither free nor slave women used to cover their breasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId580552&quot;&gt;The Quranic Verse makes clear that Hijab was only for free Muslim women against slave women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId89821&quot;&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but it is this respect and acknowledgement of women's autonomy that truly embodies the concept of modesty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId63911&quot;&gt;Role of Umar Ibn Khattab&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId130774&quot;&gt;An excuse by Islamic preachers: But the verse of Hijab 33:59 was revealed during the incident of 'Umar and Sawda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId616740&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab, the second Caliph, used to beat the slave women with a stick if they ever attempted to take Hijab (Jilbab)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId741600&quot;&gt;Please also note the difference between &quot;Jilbab&quot; and &quot;Khimar&quot;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId674959&quot;&gt;Looking and touching the private parts of half-naked slave women in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId254524&quot;&gt;All four Sunni Imams are unanimous that the nakedness (Awrah عورۃ) of a slave woman is from the navel to the knee&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId101471&quot;&gt;Hanafi Fiqh:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId775153&quot;&gt;Traditions about the 'Awrah (i.e. nakedness) of a slave woman:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId790029&quot;&gt;Slave women were standing in the mosques with naked breasts, during prayers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId914412&quot;&gt;Some Original Photos of half-naked Muslim slave women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId828467&quot;&gt;The Hijab is not a CHOICE, but Women must be veiled outside the house in Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId304226&quot;&gt;Prophet Muhammad used to roam around the city in public while holding the hands of the slave girls who belonged to other men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId681614&quot;&gt;'Aisha bathed in front of two Mahram MEN, while the nakedness of a woman in front of Mahram man is also just like the nakedness of a slave woman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId666035&quot;&gt;Excuses by Islamic apologists:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId464960&quot;&gt;The Dishonest Translation of verse 24:31 by modern Islamic apologists to prove that Khimar was also used to cover the naked breasts of slave women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId747240&quot;&gt;Islamic Preachers: Hijab is necessary for a woman so that her husband does not feel jealous and uncomfortable due to his Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId93010&quot;&gt;'Lowering the gazes' is only an Unnatural restriction, which results only in 'sexual frustration':&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId223301&quot;&gt;Islamic Apologists: Slave women were allowed to expose their chest/breasts, but it was not necessary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId581033&quot;&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah claimed that 'Awrah of slave women is like that of free Muslim women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId895120&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad revived the old custom of Arabia, where only high-status women were allowed to wear the Hijab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pre-Islamic Arabia, there existed a cultural practice where high-status women were required to wear veils as a symbol of &quot;honor,&quot; while prostitutes and slave women were not allowed to veil themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Elite women in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Byzantine, Greek, and Persian empires wore the veil &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;as a sign of respectability and high status&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_74-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-74&quot;&gt;[74]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria had explicit &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sumptuary laws&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_laws&quot;&gt;sumptuary laws&lt;/a&gt; detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_74-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-74&quot;&gt;[74]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-El_Guindi_7-4&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-El_Guindi-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Veiling was thus not only a marker of aristocratic rank, but also served to&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &quot;differentiate between 'respectable' women and those who were publicly available&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-El_Guindi_7-5&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-El_Guindi-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_74-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-74&quot;&gt;[74]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Muhammad did not introduce the Islamic hijab with the intention of promoting modesty, but rather he adopted the prevailing practices of the pre-Islamic Arabs. His aim was to distinguish free Muslim women from slave women through the implementation of hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId434974&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the pre-Islamic era, neither free nor slave women used to cover their breasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the pre-Islamic era, it was customary for women, both free and slave, in various cultures around the world, including pre-Islamic Arab society, to not cover their chests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=24&amp;amp;tAyahNo=31&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) and in Tafsir Durr-e-Manthur (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230414200817/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;ID=1902&amp;amp;bk_no=203&amp;amp;flag=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), under the commentary of verse 24:31, it is written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap&quot;&gt;أن جابر بن عبد الله الأنصاري حدث أن أسماء بنت مرشدة كانت في محل لها في بني حارثة، فجعل النساء يدخلن عليها غير متأزرات، فيبدو ما في أرجلهن من الخلاخل، وتبدو صدورهن وذوائبهن، فقالت أسماء ما أقبح هذا فأنزل الله تعالى الآية۔۔۔ وقوله تعالى { وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَىٰ جُيُوبِهِنَّ } يعني المقانع يعمل لها صنفات ضاربات على صدورهن لتواري ما تحتها من صدرها وترائبها ليخالفن شعار نساء أهل الجاهلية فإنهن لم يكن يفعلن ذلك، بل كانت المرأة منهن تمر بين الرجال مسفحة بصدرها، لا يواريه شيء، وربما أظهرت عنقها وذوائب شعرها وأقرطة آذانها&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible&quot;&gt;Jabir ibn Abdullah al-Ansari narrated that Asma bint Marwan had a place for herself in Bani Haritha, and women would visit her without wearing veils. &lt;strong&gt;Their ankles would be visible, along with their chests and necklines&lt;/strong&gt;. Asma expressed her disapproval of this, and as a result, Allah revealed the verse: &quot;...And let them draw their coverings over their chests&quot; [Quran 24:31], meaning they should cast their outer garments in a way that it covers their chests, concealing what is beneath them. This was in contrast to the practices of the women of the pre-Islamic era (jahiliyyah), as they did not observe such covering. Instead, women would pass by men &lt;strong&gt;with their chests exposed, revealing their necks, hair, and earrings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Muhammad did was to ask free Muslim women to wear the Hijab, but he PROHIBITED slave women to wear the Hijab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Therefore, even after the verse of the Hijab, there were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad and in public with naked breasts. And it stayed the same way during the 1300 years long history of Islamic Slavery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId580552&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Quranic Verse makes clear that Hijab was only for free Muslim women against slave women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=33&amp;amp;vid=59&quot;&gt;Quran 33:59&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَٰجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَآءِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَٰبِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰٓ أَن &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;يُعْرَفْنَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا&lt;br&gt;O Prophet! say to your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they let down upon them their over-garments (Arabic: Jilbab); this will be more proper, so that they may be&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;recognized&lt;/span&gt; (as free Women)&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; not annoyed/molested&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the consensus of Muslim Quran commentators, it is widely documented that this particular verse was revealed in response to a specific incident in Medina. During that time, people would gather and sit on the sides of the streets, subjecting passing women to harassment and molestation. However, upon the revelation of this verse, the harassment of free women ceased as they started wearing the hijab, which distinguished them from slave girls who did not wear hijab. Unfortunately, the molestation of slave girls persisted, as their lack of hijab served as a recognizable marker of their status as slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Commentary of Verse 33:59 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=59&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;يقول تعالى آمراً رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم تسليماً أن يأمر النساء المؤمنات ــــ خاصة أزواجه وبناته لشرفهن ــــ بأن يدنين عليهن من جلابيبهن ليتميزن عن سمات نساء الجاهلية وسمات الإماء ... قال السدي في قوله تعالى { يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ قُل لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَآءِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلاَبِيبِهِنَّ ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلاَ يُؤْذَيْنَ } قال كان ناس من فساق أهل المدينة يخرجون بالليل حين يختلظ الظلام إلى طرق المدينة يتعرضون للنساء، وكانت مساكن أهل المدينة ضيقة، فإذا كان الليل، خرج النساء إلى الطرق يقضين حاجتهن، فكان أولئك الفساق يبتغون ذلك منهن، فإذا رأوا المرأة عليها جلباب، قالوا هذه حرة، فكفوا عنها، وإذا رأوا المرأة ليس عليها جلباب، قالوا هذه أمة، فوثبوا عليها، وقال مجاهد يتجلببن فيعلم أنهن حرائر، فلا يتعرض لهن فاسق بأذى ولا ريبة.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;... (In this verse, Allah ordered the free women) to draw their Jilbabs over their bodies,&lt;strong&gt; so that they will be distinct in their appearance&lt;/strong&gt; from the women of the Jahiliyyah and from &lt;strong&gt;slave women ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;And As-&lt;strong&gt;Suddi&lt;/strong&gt; said about the revelation of this verse 33:59 that the mischief-mongers among the people of Madīnah would come out on the streets at dusk and get after the women. The houses of the people of Madīnah [in those days] were very small in size and at nightfall the women would go out on these streets [making their way to the fields] to relieve themselves. These evil people would tease and molest these women. While if they saw a woman who would be wearing a Jilbab (cloak/outer garment), they would say she is a free woman [and not a slave] and would abstain [from molesting her] and if they saw a woman who would not be wearing a cloak, they would molest her by saying that she is a slave woman.&lt;br&gt;And Mujahid said that those women would wear cloaks [in the way prescribed by the Qur'ān] so that it be known that they are free women and the mischief-mongers would not then harm or molest them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Saleh said (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=59&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;Tafsir-e-Tabari, Verse 33:59&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حدثنا ابن حميد، قال: ثنا حكام، عن عنبسة، عمن حدثه، عن أبـي صالـح، قال: قدم النبـيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم الـمدينة علـى غير منزل، فكان نساء النبـيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وغيرهنّ إذا كان اللـيـل خرجن يقضين حوائجهنّ، وكان رجال يجلسون علـى الطريق للغزل، فأنزل الله: { يا أيُّها النَّبِـيُّ قُلْ لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَناتِكَ وَنِساءِ الـمُؤْمِنِـينَ يُدْنِـينَ عَلَـيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلابِـيبِهِنَّ } يقنعن بـالـجلبـاب حتـى تعرف الأمة من الـحرّة. &lt;br&gt;Abu Saleh narrated: When the holy prophet came to Medina, he had no house in Medina. He and his wives and other women used to go outside at evening to relieve themselves. And men used to sit on the streets and used to recite poetry (to tease and molest the women). Upon that Allah revealed the verse of Hijab (33:59) so that free women could be differentiated from the slave women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;عبد الرزاق عن معمر عن الحسن قال كن إماء بالمدينة يقال لهن كذا وكذا كن يخرجن فيتعرض لهن السفهاء فيؤذوهن لأنه فكانت المرأة الحرة تخرج فيحسبون أنها أمة فيتعرضون لها ويؤذونها أخبرنا فأمر النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم المؤمنات أن يدنين عليهن من جلابيبهن ذلك أدنى أن يعرفن من الإماء أنهن حرائر فلا يؤذين&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;Al-Hassan al-Basri (died 110 Hijri year) said: Slave women in Medina used to be called with specific names (i.e. they were molested) when they went outside. One day, some ignorant people approach women and harm them, thinking they were slave women. This was because free women would also go out, and they would be mistaken for slave women, and people would approach them and cause harm. The Prophet (peace be upon him) then commanded the believing women to bring their outer garments closer to them (i.e. to take the Hijab). This was to ensure that they would be recognized as free women and not be harmed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حدثنـي مـحمد بن سعد، قال: ثنـي أبـي، قال: ثنـي عمي، قال: ثنـي أبـي، عن أبـيه، عن ابن عبـاس، قوله: { يا أيُّها النَّبِـيُّ قُلْ لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَناتِكَ وَنِساءِ الـمُؤْمِنِـينَ يُدْنِـينَ عَلَـيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلابِـيبِهِنَّ }.... إلـى قوله: { وكانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَحِيـماً } قال: كانت الـحرّة تلبس لبـاس الأمة، فأمر الله نساء الـمؤمنـين أن يدنـين علـيهنّ من جلابـيبهنّ ، وأدنى الجلباب: أن تقنع، وتشده على جبينها.&lt;br&gt;Ibn Abbas said about the verse 33:59, the free (Muslim) women used to dress same as the slave women. Upon that Allah ordered them that they let down upon them their over-garments (Arabic: Jilbab), and letting the outer-garment means to cover their faces and to tie it on their foreheads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Mujahid (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=59&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir also wrote in his commentary under verse 24:31 of Surah Nur (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=24&amp;amp;tAyahNo=31&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;هذا أمر من الله تعالى للنساء المؤمنات، وغيرة منه لأزواجهن عباده المؤمنين، وتمييز لهن عن صفة نساء الجاهلية وفعال المشركات. وكان سبب نزول هذه الآية ما ذكره مقاتل بن حيان قال بلغنا ــــ والله أعلم ــــ أن جابر بن عبد الله الأنصاري حدث أن أسماء بنت مرشدة كانت في محل لها في بني حارثة، فجعل النساء يدخلن عليها غير متأزرات، فيبدو ما في أرجلهن من الخلاخل، وتبدو صدورهن وذوائبهن، فقالت أسماء ما أقبح هذا فأنزل الله تعالى { وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَـٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَـٰرِهِنَّ }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;justify1&quot;&gt;This is a command (i.e. veiling) from Allah Almighty to the believing women, as a protection for their honor and a distinction from the characteristics of women in the pre-Islamic era and the practices of pagan women. The reason behind the revelation of this verse, as mentioned by Muqatil ibn Hayyan, is that Jabir ibn Abdullah al-Ansari reported that Asma bint Marwan had a designated place in Bani Haritha, where women would visit her without wearing veils. &lt;strong&gt;Thus, their ankles would be exposed, along with their chests and ornaments&lt;/strong&gt;. Upon seeing this, Asma expressed her disapproval. As a result, Allah Almighty revealed the verse: &quot;And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision [i.e., to look down and not to expose their adornment]...&quot; (Quran 24:31).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers often assert that those individuals who engaged in harassment and molestation of women while sitting on the sides of the streets were &lt;strong&gt;hypocrites&lt;/strong&gt;. However, this claim is contested by some who argue that they were not hypocrites but rather companions of Muhammad (Sahaba).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These individuals, who engaged in harassment and molestation, were not addressed as hypocrites in the Quran. Surprisingly, the Quran neither issued warnings nor threats against them, let alone punishments. Instead, the Quran seemingly allowed them to continue their misconduct towards slave women, while providing protection only to free women through the requirement of hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This portrayal of events raises concerns, as it appears that the Quran provided no safeguards for the well-being of slave women, inadvertently granting these individuals a &quot;license&quot; to persist in their mistreatment of vulnerable slave girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId89821&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but it is this respect and acknowledgement of women's autonomy that truly embodies the concept of modesty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, a significant majority of ordinary Muslims today remain unaware of the historical realities and complexities surrounding hijab and its relation to Islam. This truth often comes as a surprise to them, as many Islamic preachers strive to conceal or downplay these aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common for some Muslims to assert that women must wear hijab in order to prevent men from experiencing lustful desires, using the analogy that an uncovered candy attracts flies. However, it is important to recognize that this viewpoint oversimplifies the multifaceted reasons and interpretations associated with hijab within the Islamic tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please see, it was Islam which compelled thousands of slave women to move in public without a Hijab (i.e. without a wrapper). So, the question is, did Islam thus make Sahaba sexually aroused and did Sahaba rape those slave women for having naked breasts in public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but modesty is truly defined by the respect for women and their autonomy to make choices about their lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The Western world, with its emphasis on upholding women's rights and their choices, is a true example of modesty and decency. Yes, the situation on ground is not 100% perfect, but their laws and education go in the right direction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hijab is not modesty, but for 14 prolonged centuries, it has been a distressing symbol of severe discrimination against impoverished slave women.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId63911&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Role of Umar Ibn Khattab in revelation of the Hijab Ruling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is known that Muhammad faced challenges when it came to rejecting Umar's desires and suggestions. Throughout Muhammad's life, there were instances where Umar made wishes or suggestions, and Muhammad later claimed to receive revelations in alignment with those desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern is observed in the context of veiling women as well. It appears that Umar Ibn Khattab played a significant role in advocating for the veiling of free Muslim women, as he engaged in multiple discussions with Muhammad on the matter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:146&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 146&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, following the unfortunate incident of women being molested in Medina, Muhammad claimed that the verses regarding veiling were revealed in accordance with Umar's desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is worth noting that Umar held more extreme views on this matter. It appears that he was not content with the ruling of veiling for women and sought something beyond that. This becomes apparent through an incident involving Umar and Sawda, one of Muhammad's wives, which took place after the revelation of the hijab verses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4795&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature &lt;strong&gt;after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil&lt;/strong&gt;. She had a large frame and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, &quot;O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us,&lt;strong&gt; so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out.&lt;/strong&gt; Sauda returned while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I went out to answer the call of nature and `Umar said to me so-and-so.&quot; Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), &quot;You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those who advocate for Umar's stance, one might question the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should Sawda, or any woman for that matter, bear the burden of constantly finding new ways to conceal herself and endure the added restrictions? What harm would it have caused if people still recognized her when she ventured outside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while Umar expressed dissatisfaction with Hafsa's veiling, he paradoxically resorted to physically disciplining slave women for attempting to wear hijab by beating them with a stick. Furthermore, he even stripped them of their jilbab (outer garment sheet), as we will explore further in this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId130774&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An excuse by Islamic preachers: But the verse of Hijab 33:59 was revealed during the incident of 'Umar and Sawda&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for Islamic preachers to accept the notion that companions used to molest women, which led to the revelation of the Hijab verse. This realization raises questions about the entire religion of Islam and creates doubts in the minds of every person who learns about it. Therefore, they attempt to use alternative traditions and argue that the verse of the Hijab was not revealed due to the molestation of women by companions, but rather during an incident involving Umar and Sawda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:146&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 146&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّ أَزْوَاجَ النَّبِيِّ، صلى الله عليه وسلم كُنَّ يَخْرُجْنَ بِاللَّيْلِ إِذَا تَبَرَّزْنَ إِلَى الْمَنَاصِعِ ـ وَهُوَ صَعِيدٌ أَفْيَحُ ـ فَكَانَ عُمَرُ يَقُولُ لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم احْجُبْ نِسَاءَكَ‏.‏ فَلَمْ يَكُنْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَفْعَلُ، فَخَرَجَتْ سَوْدَةُ بِنْتُ زَمْعَةَ زَوْجُ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم لَيْلَةً مِنَ اللَّيَالِي عِشَاءً، وَكَانَتِ امْرَأَةً طَوِيلَةً، فَنَادَاهَا عُمَرُ أَلاَ قَدْ عَرَفْنَاكِ يَا سَوْدَةُ‏.‏ حِرْصًا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْزِلَ الْحِجَابُ، فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ آيَةَ الْحِجَابِ‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqi` at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. `Umar used to say to the Prophet (ﷺ) &quot;Let your wives be veiled,&quot; but Allah's Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam`a the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) went out at `Isha' time and &lt;strong&gt;she was a tall lady&lt;/strong&gt;. `Umar addressed her and said, &quot;I have recognized (Arabic: عَرَفْنَاكِ) you, O Sauda.&quot; He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;So Allah revealed the verses of &quot;Al-Hijab&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it is clear that any sub-narrator of this tradition made a mistake, while another tradition in Sahih Bukhari (which we have already mentioned above) is also from 'Aisha, where she clearly stated that this incident of 'Umar and Sawda occurred after the verse of Hijab had already been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4795&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature &lt;strong&gt;after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;She had a large frame and everybody who knew her before could recognize her&lt;/strong&gt;. So `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, &quot;O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. ....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is also clear from both traditions that Sawda was indeed wearing the hijab (jilbab), and Umar did not recognize her because of her face, but only because of her tall stature (i.e., Sawda was a tall woman with a large frame). This proves that the verse of hijab (33:59) had already been revealed before the incident involving Umar and Sawda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the verse of hijab (33:59) itself contradicts the notion that it was revealed during the incident involving Umar and Sawda. There are two significant facts that support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, by taking jilbab (cloaks), women cannot be recognized while their faces are covered. Nobody knows which woman is actually inside the cloak. However, the Quran says: &quot;(the women) should take jilbab (cloaks) so that they can be recognized...&quot; (Arabic: يعرفن). Why does the Quran say the opposite, that they can be recognized by using cloaks? The answer lies in the fact that the Quran refers to recognizing in the sense of distinguishing between slave women and free Muslim women. Hence, this part of the verse itself proves that it was not revealed about the incident of Umar/Sawda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, this verse also claims: &quot;... and (these women are) not molested.&quot; Ask these Islamic preachers if Umar ibn Khattab was molesting Sawda. The answer is no. It was not Umar ibn Khattab who molested Sawda, but rather the people who were sitting on the streets, who were molesting the women of Medina. Therefore, this serves as further evidence that the hijab verse (33:59) is unrelated to the incident involving Umar and Sawda. Instead, it stands as a testimony that this verse was indeed revealed about the incident when companions were molesting the women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId616740&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab, the second Caliph, used to beat the slave women with a stick if they ever attempted to take&lt;b&gt; Hijab (Jilbab)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;According to authentic traditions, Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat those slave girls with a stick, who ever attempted to hide their naked bodies by taking Jilbab. He used to tell those slave girls not to try to become equal in status with the free Muslim women by taking Jilbab/Muqna (Jilbab and Muqna, both are outer garments, used for Hijab) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Saudi grand hadith master Sheikh Albani recorded this authentic tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210329003506/http://islamport.com/w/alb/Web/1202/2092.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt; حدثنا وكيع قال :  حدثنا شعبة عن قتادة عن أنس قال : &quot;  رأى عمر أمة لنا مقنعة فضربها وقال :  لا تشبهين بالحرائر &quot; .  قلت :  وهذا إسناد صحيح&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Companion Anas reported: &quot;Umar saw one of our slave girls covering herself with Muqna (which is an outer garment like Jilbab and was used to cover the breasts and body), so he struck her and said, 'Do not resemble the free women.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I (i.e. Sheikh Albani) say:  'And this chain of narration is authentic.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This same tradition is also narrated by Ibn Qalabah (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210920104640/https://islamarchive.cc/H_85618&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Abdur Razzak (d 211 Hijri year) recorded this narration (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210920105238/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=73&amp;amp;ID=4816&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;عبد الرزاق عن معمر عن أيوب عن نافع أن عمر رأى جارية خرجت من بيت حفصة متزينة عليها جلباب أو من بيت بعض أزواج النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم فدخل عمر البيت فقال من هذه الجارية فقالوا أمة لنا – أو قالوا أمة لآل فلان – فتغيظ عليهم وقال أتخرجون إماءكم بزينتها تفتنون الناس&lt;br&gt;Umar once saw a young girl leaving the house of Hafsa (his daughter), adorned with a cloak (i.e. Jilbab) — or, from one of the houses of the Prophet’s wives. Umar entered the house and said, “Who is this girl?” They said, “A slave of ours” — or, a slave of someone’s family. He became enraged at them and said, “Your slave girls left with their adornment, and created discord (by taking Jilbab) amongst the people (while they were unable to distinguish her from the free Muslim women).”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt; And Saudi grand hadith master Sheikh Albani recorded this tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170119173848/http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-22592/page-2084&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;حدثنا على بن مسهر عن المختار بن فلفل عن أنس بن مالك قال: &quot;  دخلت على عمر بن الخطاب أمة قد كان يعرفها لبعض المهاجرين أو الأنصار ,  وعليها جلباب متقنعة به ,  فسألها:  عتقت؟ قالت:  لا:  قال:  فما بال الجلباب؟!  ضعيه عن رأسك ,  إنما الجلباب على الحرائر من نساء المؤمنين ,  فتلكأت ,  فقام إليها بالدرة ,  فضرب بها رأسها حتى ألقته عن رأسها &quot;.&lt;br&gt;قلت:  وهذا سند صحيح على شرط مسلم.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anas bin Malik said: &quot;I entered upon Umar bin Al-Khattab with a female slave that he knew, either from the Muhajireen or the Ansar, and she was wearing a well-adorned cloak (i.e. Jilbab, which was used to cover her breasts and body with it). He asked her, 'Have you been set free?' She replied, 'No.' He then said, 'What is with the cloak?' 'Take it off your head. The cloak is only for the free women among the believers.' She hesitated, so he got up and took it off her head forcefully, hitting her with a whip until he removed it from her head.&quot; &lt;br&gt;I (i.e. Sheikh Albani) say, &quot;And this chain is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Ibn Abi Shayba also recorded this tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210920104640/https://islamarchive.cc/H_85618&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;حَدَّثَنَا &lt;span class=&quot;Rawy_name&quot;&gt;هُشَيْمٌ &lt;/span&gt;، عَنْ &lt;span class=&quot;Rawy_name&quot;&gt;خَالِدٍ &lt;/span&gt;، عَنْ &lt;span class=&quot;Rawy_name&quot;&gt;أَبِي قِلَابَةَ &lt;/span&gt;، قَالَ : كَانَ عُمَرُ بْنُ الْخَطَّابِ لَا &lt;span class=&quot;Gareeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;يدع : يترك&quot;&gt;يَدْعُ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;فِي خِلَافَتِهِ &lt;span class=&quot;Gareeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;الأمة : الجارية المملوكة&quot;&gt;أَمَةً &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Gareeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;التقنع : تغطية الرأس وأكثر الوجه برداء أو غيره&quot;&gt;تَقَنَّعُ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;، قَالَ : قَالَ &lt;span class=&quot;Rawy_name&quot;&gt;عُمَرُ &lt;/span&gt;: إِنَّمَا الْقِنَاعُ لِلْحَرَائِرِ لَكَيْلَا لَا يُؤْذَيْنَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Narrated to us Hushaym, from Khalid, from Abu Qilaba, who said: &quot;Umar ibn al-Khattab, during his caliphate, did not leave any slave girl who could cover herself. He said: 'Covering oneself is only for free (Muslim/Believing) women, so they may not be harmed (i.e. people can differentiate them with slave women and don't harm the free Muslim women).'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The traditions related to Umar Ibn Khattab further corroborate the twelve traditions that highlight the revelation of the hijab verse (33:59) as a means to distinguish between slave women and free Muslim women. These traditions collectively provide supporting evidence for this understanding of the verse's purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;It is interesting to see that such punishments were also present in the &lt;span&gt;ancient Assyrian law for resembling free women:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_law&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;17 &quot;If the wives of a man, or the daughters of a man go out into the street, their heads are to be veiled. The prostitute is not to be veiled. Maidservants are not to veil themselves. Veiled harlots and maidservants shall have their garments seized and 50 blows inflicted on them and bitumen poured on their heads.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId741600&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Please also note the difference between &quot;Jilbab&quot; and &quot;Khimar&quot;:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilb%C4%81b&quot;&gt;A Jilbab&lt;/a&gt; (or  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D9%85%D9%82%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A9/&quot;&gt;Muqna&lt;/a&gt;) was a large outer garment/sheet that was placed on the head, draped around the body, and completely covered the breasts and body of the woman. In the verse of Hijab (Quran 33:59), the author of the Quran instructed free Muslim women to use the same Jilbab to cover their breasts and bodies. Meanwhile, slave women were not permitted to use Jilbab to cover their breasts and bodies. According to traditions, Umar Ibn Khattab removed the Jilbab from the heads of slave women, exposing their bare breasts once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;In contrast, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21134/is-niqab-compulsory#:%7E:text=Khimar%20comes%20from%20the%20word,something%20else%20is%20called%20Khimar.&quot;&gt;Khimar (Arabic: خمار)&lt;/a&gt;&quot; refers to a small headscarf that covers only the head and extends up to the shoulders. Today, we can see Arab men wearing this Khimar (Arabic headscarf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:275&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ &lt;strong&gt;وَالْخِمَارِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped over the socks and &lt;strong&gt;Khimar&lt;/strong&gt; (Arabic Head Scarf)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Slave women were allowed to cover their head and hair by wearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21134/is-niqab-compulsory#:%7E:text=Khimar%20comes%20from%20the%20word,something%20else%20is%20called%20Khimar.&quot;&gt;Khimaar خمأر&lt;/a&gt;. Covering the head was a per-Islamic tradition due to the heat in Arab area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 'Abdul Razzaq recorded in this book al-Musanif (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170115185806/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=73&amp;amp;ID=520&amp;amp;idfrom=4807&amp;amp;idto=4820&amp;amp;bookid=73&amp;amp;startno=6&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عبد الرزاق عن بن جريج قال بلغني عن أشياخ من أهل المدينة أن الخمر على الإماء إذا حضن وليس عليهن الجلابيب&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abd al-Razzaq narrated from Ibn Jarir who said: &quot;I heard from the elders of Medina that when a slave girt started to menstruate, she would cover her head with Khimar, but not wear a Jilbab.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Khimar was not the primary distinguishing factor between free women and slave women, as both groups wore Khimar to cover their heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main differentiating factor between them was Jilbab. Moreover, in the traditions mentioned earlier, Umar Ibn Khattab removed the Jilbab from the slave women, exposing their bare breasts once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId674959&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Looking and touching the private parts of half-naked slave women in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1400 years of history of Islam also consists of this shameful act against humanity, where Muslim men forced those women/girls to become half naked by exposing their breasts, and then forced them to stand in front of thousands of men in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, who not only looked at them with lust but they were also allowed to touch their private parts (as if they were sheep and goats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bayhiqi wrote in his book Sunan al-Kubra (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150909140424/http://library.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?bk_no=673&amp;amp;pid=332183&amp;amp;hid=9985&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;حدثنا جرير عن منصور عن مجاهد قال :  كنت مع ابن عمر أمشي في السوق فإذا نحن بناس من النخاسين قد اجتمعوا على جارية يقلبونها ، فلما رأوا ابن عمر تنحوا وقالوا :  ابن عمر قد جاء ، فدنا منها ابن عمر فلمس شيئا من جسدها وقال :  أين أصحاب هذه الجارية ، إنما هي سلعة&lt;br&gt;Mujahid said: ‘I was walking with ibn Umar in a slave market, then we saw some slave dealers gathered around one slave girl and they were checking her, when they saw Ibn Umar, they stopped and said: ‘Ibn Umar has arrived’. Then ibn Umar came closer to the slave girl, he touched some parts of her body and then said: ‘Who is the owner of this slave girl, she is just a commodity!’&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Shaybani (died 189 hijri year) wrote in his book al-Masoot (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMneWgmvLMAhViEpoKHW7SCq4QFggjMAE&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fislamport.com%2Fw%2Fhnf%2FWeb%2F2217%2F463.htm&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNE4pHhWGCgcmhFFkjVjKhvYhiylkA&amp;amp;sig2=wQtlwzEO1HXOUehof3e55A&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;ولا ينبغي للرجل أن ينظر من أمة غيره إذا كانت بالغة أو تشتهي مثلها أو توطأ إلا ما ينظر إليه من ذوات المحرم ولا بأس بأن ينظر إلى شعرها وإلى صدرها وإلى ثديها وعضدها وقدمها وساقها ولا ينظر إلى بطنها ولا إلى ظهرها ولا إلى ما بين السرة منها حتى يجاوز الركبة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It is not permissible for a man to look at the body of a female slave who is mature or whom he desires, except for what is allowed in the case of mahram (close relatives). There is no harm in looking at her hair, chest, breasts, shoulders, arms, and legs. However, one should not look at her stomach, back, or the area between her navel and knee.&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The slave women of Umar Ibn Khattab used to serve men with naked breasts. Imam Bayhiqi recorded this tradition and declared it &quot;Sahih&quot; in his book al-Sunan al-Kubra (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dorar.net/h/e8a4ee380489a2076c04a6a960ed522f&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; ثم روى من طريق حماد بن سلمة قالت : حدثني ثمامة بن عبد الله بن أنس عن جده أنس بن مالك قال : &quot; كن إماء عمر رضي الله عنه يخدمننا كاشفات عن شعورهن تضطرب ثديهن &quot; . قلت : وإسناده جيد رجاله كلهم ثقات غير شيخ البيهقي أبي القاسم عبد الرحمن بن عبيد الله الحربي ( 1 ) وهو صدوق كما قال الخطيب ( 10 / 303 ) وقال البيهقي عقبه : &quot; والاثار عن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه في ذلك صحيحة &quot; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anas bin Malik said: ‘The female slaves of Umar were serving us with uncovered hair and their breasts shaking”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Sheikh Albani also declared it &quot;Sahih&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dorar.net/h/ffe4e2bb590a45ecd7f7595735686a44&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; This humiliation of the slave woman raises serious questions about the concept of &quot;Islamic modesty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId254524&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All four Sunni Imams are unanimous that the nakedness (Awrah عورۃ) of a slave woman is from the navel to the knee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Even when Islam was not selling the slave women in the Bazaars, still it forced them to move outside in public, with naked breasts, while Islam declared the intimate parts of slave women (‘Awrah) of slave women were from the navel to the knee only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;It is perhaps the “Biggest Contradiction” in Islam. On one side, Islam asked free Muslim women to wear a full-body Hijab, but on the other side, Islam snatched away the right of Hijab from slave women and even forced them to move outside with naked breasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;All four Sunni Imams of Fiqh are unanimous that the nakedness of a slave woman is only from the navel to the knee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It is permissible for a non-mahram (non-related) person to look at the hair, arms, legs, chest, and breasts of a female slave.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Hanafi Fiqh book &quot;Fatawa-a-Alamgiri&quot; (which was written by 500 Islamic Scholars upon the order of Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Alamgiri_Awrah_slave_woman.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is allowed to see the whole body of a slave woman of another person, except between her navel and the knees ... And all that is allowed to be seen, it is also allowed to be touched.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId275339&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Shafi'i Fiqh:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is also the same ruling in the Fiqh of Imam Shafii too. See the book &quot;Al-Muhadab fi Fiqh al-Shafi'i, written by Shirazi (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210914182624/https://www.maktabatalfeker.com/book.php?id=2551&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;وقال ابن حامد عورتها كعورة الرجل ، لما روى عمر بن شعيب عن أبيه عن جده أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال :  إذا زوج أحدكم أمته عبده أو أجيره فلا ينظر إلى شيء من عورته فإن ما تحت السرة إلى الركبة عورة يريد عورة الأمة ، رواه الدارقطني .  ولأنه من لم يكن رأسه عورة لم يكن صدره عورة ،&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hamed said that the 'awrah (private area) of a slave woman is like that of a man. This is based on the narration of 'Umar ibn Shu'aib from his father, from his grandfather, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &quot;When any of you marries his slave woman or a female servant, he should not look at any part of her 'awrah. For what is below the navel and above the knees is 'awrah, referring to the 'awrah of the slave woman.&quot; This narration was reported by ad-Daraqutni. And because if one's head is not considered 'awrah, then their chest is also not considered 'awrah.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId210102&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Maliki Fiqh:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is written in the Book &quot;Al-Sharh al-Saghir&quot; of Maliki Fiqh (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فيرى الرجل من المرأة -  إذا كانت أمة -  أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة&lt;br&gt;&quot;When a man sees a female slave, he sees more of her than she sees of him, as she only sees his face and extremities. Meanwhile, he sees everything except for what is between her navel and knee because the nakedness (Awrah) of a female slave, in the presence of a non-mahram (a non-related man), is everything except what lies between her navel and knee.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Qurtabi writes in his famous Tafsir of the Quran, Verse 7:26 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://gegasoft.com/quran-reader/en/tafaseer/tafseer-qurtabi/surah-7-al_aaraaf-verse_no-28.html&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“ وأما الأمة فالعورة منها ما تحت ثدييها ، ولها أن تبدي رأسها ومعصميها .  وقيل :  حكمها حكم الرجل”&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;&quot;As for the slave woman, her 'awrah (private area) is from below her breasts, but she is allowed to uncover her head and wrists. It is also said that her ruling is like that of a man.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId775153&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Traditions about the 'Awrah (i.e. nakedness) of a slave woman:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Imam Abdul Razzaq recorded many traditions upon the 'Awrah (i.e. nakedness) of a slave woman in his books &quot;al-Munsif&quot;. Some of these traditions are presented below (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamicbook.ws/hadeth/msnf-abd-alrzaq-011.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13206 - عبد الرزاق عن ابن جريج عن رجل عن ابن المسيب أنه قال: يحل له أن ينظر إلى كل شئ فيها، ما عدا فرجها.&lt;br&gt;Said ibn al-Musayyib said if one wants to buy a slave girl, then he can see whole of her body except for her vagina (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1893_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_287#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13207 - عبد الرزاق عن الثوري عن جابر عن الشعبي قال: إذا كان الرجل يبتاع الأمة فإنه ينظر إلى كلها إلا &lt;span class=&quot;index index-197&quot; title=&quot;الفرج&quot;&gt;الفرج&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Abdul Razzaq reported from Ath-Thawri, from Jabir, from Ash-Sha'bi, who said: &quot;When a man buys a slave woman, he is allowed to look at all of her except her vagina.&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1893_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_287#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13208 - عبد الرزاق عن ابن جريج قال: &lt;span class=&quot;index index-479&quot; title=&quot;الأكل&quot;&gt;أكل&lt;/span&gt; في.... (1) أصدق عمن سمع عليا يسأل عن الأمة تباع، أينظر إلى ساقها، وعجزها، وإلى بطنها؟ قال: لا بأس بذلك، لا حرمة لها، إنما وقفت لنساومها.&lt;br&gt;A reliable person heard Ali (the fourth caliph) being asked about buying a slave woman and whether it is permissible to look at her legs, her private area, and her stomach. Upon that he replied there is no harm in seeing them while a slave woman has no honour. Rather, it is allowed in order to assess her before bargaining (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1893_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_287#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1792 - ( روى أبو حفص بإسناده : &quot; أن ابن عمر كان يضع يده بين ثدييها ( يعني الجارية ) وعلى عجزها من فوق الثياب ويكشف عن ساقها &quot; ذكره في الوقع ) . صحيح . أخرجه البيهقي ( 5 / 329 ) من طريق عبيد الله بن عمر عن نافع عن ابن عمر : &quot; أنه كان إذا اشترى جارية كشف عن ساقها ووضع يده بين ثدييها وعلى عجزها &quot; . وفي آخره زيادة : &quot; وكأنه كان يضعها عليها من وراء الثياب &quot; . ولعلها من البيهقي أو من بعض رواته . والسند صحيح .&lt;br&gt;Abu Hafs narrated with his chain of narration: &quot;Ibn Umar used to place his hand between the breasts of the slave woman (referring to the chest area) and on her private area above her clothing, and he would uncover her leg.&quot; It is mentioned it is authentic report. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in his Sunan (5/329) through the narration of Ubaidullah ibn Umar from Nafi' from Ibn Umar: &quot;Whenever he would buy a slave girl, he would uncover her leg and place his hand between her breasts and on her private area.&quot; At the end of the narration, there is an addition: &quot;It is as if he would place his hand on her from behind the clothing.&quot; It is possible that this addition is from Al-Bayhaqi or from some of its narrators. And the chain of narration is authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi grand Mufti Albani declared this tradition to be &quot;authentic&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130619131945/http://islamport.com/w/alb/Web/1202/2090.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13203 - عبد الرزاق عن ابن عيينة عن عمرو بن دينار عن مجاهد قال: كنت مع ابن عمر في السوق، فأبصر بجارية تباع، فكشف عن ساقها، وصك في صدرها، وقال: اشتروا، يريهم أنه لا بأس بذلك.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdul Razzaq reported from Ibn Ayyinah, from Amr ibn Dinar, from Mujahid who said: &quot;I was with Ibn Umar in the marketplace when he saw a slave girl being sold. He uncovered her leg and tapped her chest, and he said: 'Buy her, showing them that there is no defect in her.'&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1893_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_286#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists TODAY present this excuse that the naked breasts of slave women were only limited to the Bazaars of Slavery, but again they have not a single proof from the Quran or Hadith or any early Fatwa that it was limited to Bazaars of Slavery only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId790029&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Slave women were standing in the mosques with naked breasts, during prayers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;What's more, slave women were offering their PRAYERS with naked breasts. Imam Ibn Hazm recorded in his book Al-Muhala, Kitab al-Rizaa, Volume 10 page 23 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918142619/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=2095&amp;amp;idto=2095&amp;amp;bk_no=17&amp;amp;ID=2053&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;لا يستحي من أن يطلق أن للمملوكة أن تصلي عريانة يرى الناس ثدييها وخاصرتها وان للحرة أن تتعمد أن تكشف من شفتي فرجها مقدار الدرهم البغلي تصلي كذلك ويراها الصادر والوارد بين الجماعة في المسجد&lt;/div&gt;
“He (Abu Hanifa) was not shy to say that a slave woman can pray naked and the people can observe her breasts and waist. A free woman can purposely show the parts of her vagina during prayers and can be observed by whosoever enters and leaves the mosque.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Another Saudi grand Mufti Sheikh Uthaymeen gave this fatwa (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiy2ZLUxqzrAhUD-qQKHRVHBOIQFjADegQIAhAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fislamport.com%2Fw%2Fhnb%2FWeb%2F883%2F452.htm&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2u465KOVbmHFlcD9eyR8M6&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;الأَمَةُ -  ولو بالغة -  وهي المملوكة، فعورتها من السُّرَّة إلى الرُّكبة، فلو صلَّت الأَمَةُ مكشوفة البدن ما عدا ما بين السُّرَّة والرُّكبة، فصلاتها صحيحة، لأنَّها سترت ما يجب عليها سَتْرُه في الصَّلاة.&lt;br&gt;The slave woman, even if she is an adult, and by slave woman we mean a female slave, her 'Awrah (private parts) is from the navel to the knee. If the slave woman prays with her body uncovered except for what is between the navel and the knee, her prayer is valid because she covered what is obligatory for her to cover in prayer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Ibn Abi Shaybah made a whole chapter with the name &quot;&lt;strong&gt;في &lt;span class=&quot;mainsubj&quot;&gt;الأمة تصلي بغير خمار &lt;/span&gt;slave woman will pray without a veil&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and there he recorded 18 traditions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/10/690/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%AE%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(12) Waki' narrated to us, he said: Shu'bah informed us from Qatadah from Anas who said: &quot;Umar saw a slave woman from our women covering herself, so he struck her and said: 'Do not resemble the free women.'&quot;  ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(15) Abd al-A'la narrated to us from Ma'mar from az-Zuhri from Anas who said: &quot;Umar saw a slave girl covering herself, so he struck her and said: 'Do not resemble the free women.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(16) Ali bin Mas'har narrated to us from al-Mukhtar bin Fulfal from Anas bin Malik who said: &quot;I entered upon Umar bin al-Khattab with a female slave that he knew, either from the Muhajireen or the Ansar, and she was wearing a well-adorned cloak. He asked her, 'Have you been set free?' She replied, 'No.' He then said, 'What is with the cloak?' 'Take it off your head. The cloak is only for the free women among the believers.' She hesitated, so he got up and took it off her head forcefully, hitting her with a whip until he removed it from her head.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Please remember that this slave girl was there with naked breasts too, which makes things even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Why did Prophet Muhammad feel the need to hold her hand? Couldn't they simply walk around the city without holding hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;This same tradition is also present in Sahih Bukhari too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6072&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6072&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Anas bin Malik said, &quot;Any of the female slaves of Medina could take hold of the hand of Allah's Apostle and take him wherever she wished.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see these two extreme contradictions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, free women are confined and covered from head to toe in Jilbab, and sometimes even further restricted within the walls of their homes. They are forced to live unnatural lives, where any interaction with men is strictly prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, slave women are left exposed, with their breasts uncovered. They are treated as commodities, allowing customers to touch their private parts like animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This happened while no Allah is present above in the heavens, and a human (i.e. Muhammad) was making the laws in the name of revelations on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Also look at this tradition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2017a&quot;&gt;2017a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudhaifa reported: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;When we attended a dinner along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) we did not lay our hands on the food until Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had laid his hand and commenced eating (the food). Once we went with him to a dinner when a girl came rushingly as it someone had been pursuing her. She was about to lay her hand on the food, &lt;strong&gt;when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) caught her hand.&lt;/strong&gt; Then a desert Arab came there (rushingly) as if someone had been pursuing him. He (the Holy Prophet) caught his hand; and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Satan considers that food lawful on which Allah's name is not mentioned. He had brought this girl so that the food might be made lawful for him and I caught her hand. And he had brought a desert Arab so that (the food) might be lawful for him. So I caught his hand. &lt;strong&gt;By Him, in Whose hand is my life, it was (Satan's) hand that was in my hand along with her hand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH1&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId681614&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'Aisha bathed in front of two Mahram MEN, while the nakedness of a woman in front of Mahram man is also just like the nakedness of a slave woman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the revelation of the verse of Hijab, neither free Muslim women nor slave women covered their naked breasts in public, as it was a custom of the Arabs of that era.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the revelation of the verse of Hijab, free Muslim women began covering their naked breasts and bodies with Jilbab &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Public&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the instruction to wear Jilbab did not apply indoors in front of Mahram men. Therefore, free Muslim women did not covered their naked breasts with Jilbab inside their homes in front of their Mahram male relatives. According to Islamic law, a free Muslim woman's 'Awrah (private parts) in front of Mahram men extended only from her navel to her knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:251&quot;&gt;Sahih al Bukhari, Bab Grhusl Volume 1, Book 5, Number 251&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Salama: ‘Ayesha’s brother and I went to ‘A’isha and he asked her about the bath of the Prophet. She brought a pot containing about a Sa’ of water and took a bath and poured it over her head and at what time there was a screen between her and us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grand scholar Ibn Hajar el-Asqallani, the commentator of Sahih Bukhari, wrote under this hadith (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/52/492/index.php&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قوله : ( وبيننا وبينها حجاب ) قال القاضي عياض : ظاهره أنهما رأيا عملها في رأسها وأعالي جسدها مما يحل نظره للمحرم ; لأنها خالة أبي سلمة من الرضاع أرضعته أختها أم كلثوم وإنما سترت أسافل بدنها مما لا يحل للمحرم النظر إليه&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qadi Ayad says: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is apparent that they could see her actions from her head and the top half of her body, because they were allowed to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as she was a milk-aunt to Abu Salamah and his brother from her sister Umm Kulthum. As for the lower part of her body, this was covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is written in Fatawa Alamgiri (also knowns as Fatawa-e-Hindiya, as it was compiled by 500 scholars from India on the orders of Emperor Aurganzeb Alamgir). &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080103201511/http://feqh.al-islam.com/Display.asp?Mode=0&amp;amp;MaksamID=896&amp;amp;DocID=73&amp;amp;ParagraphID=20362&amp;amp;Diacratic=0&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for looking at his Mahram women (like mother, adult daughter, sister and every Mahram female like the grandmother, child, grandchild and aunt) we say that it is permissible for him to look at the apparent and hidden areas of their adornment, which include the head, hair, neck, &lt;strong&gt;chest&lt;/strong&gt;, ears, shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hands, legs, and face. This is the correct view, as mentioned in Al-Muhit. Whatever is permissible to look at, it is also permissible to touch, look at, and wink at without any barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId666035&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Excuses by Islamic apologists:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few excuses, which are presented by Islamic apologists today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Muslim Objection: There is no Hadith in Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim which tells that slave women were prohibited from wearing the Hijab or their breasts were naked in public&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is no Hadith present in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim which prohibits slave women from wearing the Hijab or about their naked breasts. But the opposite is also true i.e. there is not a single Hadith present in them which claims otherwise i.e. slave women have to wear the Hijab and they have to cover their breasts. And, there are many traditions found in hadith books (though not in Bukhari or Muslim) that unequivocally show that slave women were forbidden from donning the hijab and their breasts were exposed in public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all Muslim jurists (fuqaha), who came before Bukhari and Muslim (like Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik), they unanimously agreed that slave women's breasts were uncovered, their awrah extending only from their navel to their knees. This practice was upheld without interruption (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/article/183231/the-concept-of-tawatur&quot;&gt;Tawattur&lt;/a&gt;) by every generation of Muslims. In contrast, hadith is relatively insignificant compared to this persistent tradition of the entire Muslim community over centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Imams Bukhari and Muslim failed to document any ahadith on this subject raises suspicion and begs the question: why did they not investigate and refute it by revealing those ahadith (if they existed) that ordered covering the bare breasts of enslaved women? The answer is clear: Imams Bukhari and Muslim were aware of Islam's dual standards regarding modesty, where free women must cover themselves completely while enslaved women were left with exposed breasts. These double standards of Islam brought them great shame, prompting them to ignore the matter entirely in their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do Muslim Scholars react to this objetion?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Muslim reader asked this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do Muslim Scholars react to this objection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be better if Muslim readers of this article ask this question directly from Muslim Scholars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, here is our experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim scholars have attempted to conceal this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, there were some fatwas and discussions about this issue online, but Muslims removed them to avoid raising awareness among people. However, all relevant information remains available in thousands of Islamic books of the last 14 centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunni scholars cannot justify this practice. All earlier Sunni fuqaha (jurists) issued fatwas stating that a slave woman's awrah (nakedness) extended only from her navel to her knees, leaving her breasts exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As compared to Sunni scholars, the Salafi scholars took another approach. Salafists started altogether denying that Islam prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab or kept their breasts naked in public. However, Salafists provide no evidence from the Quran or hadith to support their claims. Their primary argument relies on Ibn Hazm, an early Salafi (Zahiri) scholar who lived 450 years after Muhammad's death. He asserted that slave women should cover their breasts, but failed to provide any scriptural basis (from the Quran or Hadith) for his assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent Salafi (Zahiri) scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qudammah followed suit, offering speculative opinions without any concrete proof from the Quran or Hadith. Their claims carry no weight since they lack supporting evidence from the Quran or hadith, especially given the abundance of contradictory evidence in Islamic texts and the continuous practice of all early Muslim generations. For instance, Ibn Taymiyyah lived seven centuries after Muhammad's death; thus, his unsubstantiated claims hold no significance when pitted against the collective testimony of countless sources describing slave women's nakedness in Islamic societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId581033&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah claimed that 'Awrah of slave women is like that of free Muslim women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Salafi Islamic apologist wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default position is that the nakedness of a maidservant is like a free woman (i.e. she has to cover the whole body)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Sharḥ al-ʻUmdah 1/275&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly&lt;/strong&gt;, please note that Ibn Taymiyyah failed to cite a single Quranic Verse or a single Hadith which claims that the nakedness of slave women is their whole body and it is obligatory for them to take the Hijab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly&lt;/strong&gt;, it is the 13 centuries-long history of Islam where slave women were kept naked in public. It was the Salaf (early) Muslim generations of the first 450 years who &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;unanimously&lt;/strong&gt; kept slave women naked in public. All 4 Sunni Imams were united on this point. There is not a single opposing opinion present in the first 450 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;After 450 years, it was Ibn Hazm (from the Zahiri school of thought) who first went against this Ijma of previous Salaf Muslim generations. Later, he was followed by other Zahiri scholars too like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah&quot;&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah&lt;/a&gt; (died 728 Hijri), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Qattan&quot;&gt;Ibn al-Qattan&lt;/a&gt; (died 623 Hijri), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hayyan_al-Gharnati&quot;&gt;Abu Hayyan&lt;/a&gt; (died 745 Hijri) and the likes of Sheikh Albani in the present century. But all of them were unable to bring a single direct Quranic verse or Hadith which orders that slave women have to cover their breasts, and they are also allowed to wear the Hijab (for example when they are not working).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In the absence of even a single proof from the Quran or Sunnah by those later coming few Zahiri Scholars, other Muslims ignored them and they followed those Quranic verses and dozens of Ahadith which claim the opposite. And thus, the slave women stayed naked for 13 centuries of Islamic history, till slavery was banned in Islamic countries under the pressure of Western powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thirdly&lt;/strong&gt;, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/article/183231/the-concept-of-tawatur&quot;&gt;Tawattur&lt;/a&gt; (the widespread practice) in the actions of companions of Muhammad and Tabi'un (i.e. the Muslim generation which followed companions), in keeping thousands of slave women with naked breasts in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Malik, being a Taba Tabi'i himself in Medina, witnessed the actions of the Tabi'un in Medina, where they unanimously kept the breasts of thousands of slave women naked. It is reported that Malik didn't personally like this practice, but when it came to giving the legal Ruling (i.e. Fatwa), then he also stated that the nakedness of slave women was only between the navel to the knee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only Imam Malik but also other jurists before him witnessed this widespread practice among the Sahaba and Tabi'in. For instance, Abu Hanifa, who was himself a Tabi'i, observed the Tawattur (the widespread practice) among the Sahaba, as &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;they kept thousands of slave women with naked breasts in public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is inconceivable that Malik and Abu Hanifa and all other jurists of their time and before them would have witnessed this Tawattur in the actions of the Sahaba and Tabi'in, and still had gone opposite to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourthly&lt;/strong&gt;, is Allah really All-Knowing? If yes, why then did He forget to mention in the Quran that slave women have to cover their breasts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Allah was UNABLE to explicitly state in the Quran that slave women should cover their breasts, resulting in ALL Muslims of the first 4 centuries being misguided and unanimously agreeing (IJMA) that slave girls should not cover their naked breasts in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the unfortunate slave women had to endure this neglect from the so-called all-knowing and all-wise Allah for 13 centuries of Islamic Slavery's history until Kafir Western intervention forcefully abolished slavery in Islamic countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah filled the Quran, a huge book, with boasts about his powers and praises, yet failed to mention a single verse about the naked breasts of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who should be held responsible for the sufferings endured by millions of slave women for 13 long centuries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islamic preachers: But Imam Malik disliked that slave women move in Medina with naked breasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists also presented this argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malik was asked: Do you dislike a servant-girl to go out bare-chested? Malik said: Yes, and I would punish her for that. (Source: Mawāhib al-Jalīl 1/501)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only Malik's &quot;&lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; dislike, but it has nothing to do with Quran/Hadith and Islamic Sharia. You can see that despite this personal dislike, Malik is unable to present a single verse from the Quran or to bring a single Hadith which claims otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why when Malik wrote a letter to the Sultan and demanded to ban slave women with naked breasts in public, the Sultan denied it while Malik failed to provide any proof from the Quran/Sunnah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maliki Scholar Imam Ibn Abi Zayd (died 386 Hijri) wrote in his book &quot;al-Jameh&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://shamela.ws/book/18260/108#p1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), and also see &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210303222328/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/367498/slave-women-did-not-walk-bare-breasted-during-lifetime-of-prophet-sallallaahu-alayhi-wa-sallam&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وأنكر ما يفعل جواري المدينة يخرجن فيكشفن ما فوق الإزار، قال: قد كلمت فيه السلطان فلم أجب إلى ذلك&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;He (i.e. al-Imam Malik ibn Anas) strongly disapproved of the behavior of the slave women of al-Medinah in going out uncovered above the lower garment (i.e with naked breasts). He said: &quot;I have spoken to the Sultan about it, but I have not received a reply.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that these statements of Imam Malik are themselves going against Islamic apologists, and they are themselves serving as &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;proof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the continuous practice of the whole Muslim society where slave women were moving in Medina with naked breasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when it came to giving Fatwa about Islamic Sharia, then Imam Malik himself accepted that breasts are not included in the 'Awrah of slave women in Islamic Sharia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find this fatwa of Imam Malik in the Book &quot;Al-Sharh al-Saghir&quot; of Maliki Fiqh (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فيرى الرجل من المرأة - إذا كانت أمة - أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A man can see more of the body of a slave woman as compared to what she can see of a man. She is allowed only to see his hands and feet, while a man is allowed to see her whole body naked except for the part between her navel and knees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't know exactly what led Malik to personally dislike it? But it may be due to a simple reason, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today, we easily feel the CONTRADICTION in Islamic Rulings where free women have to cover their whole bodies in the name of modesty. But when Islam prohibits slave women from wearing hijab and even keeps their breasts naked, then it goes against the concept of modesty. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only we can feel this contradiction, but it may be Malik was also able to feel this contradiction, which led to his personal dislike for it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId464960&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Dishonest Translation of verse 24:31 by modern Islamic apologists to prove that Khimar was also used to cover the naked breasts of slave women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of the dishonesty of some of the modern Islamic apologists. Their deception is where they started claiming that Khimar was not a head covering, but Allah ordered to cover the breasts too with Khimar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.31&quot;&gt;24:31&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَٰرِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ &lt;strong&gt;بِخُمُرِهِنَّ&lt;/strong&gt; عَلَىٰ&lt;strong&gt; جُيُوبِهِنَّ&lt;/strong&gt; ۖ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Dr. Mustafa Khattab]  And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their adornments except what normally appears. Let them draw their &lt;strong&gt;veils&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. Khimar خمار)  over their &lt;strong&gt;chests&lt;/strong&gt; (Arabic:جُيُوبِهِنَّ), and not reveal their ˹hidden˺ adornments except to their husbands, their fathers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, they have started translating Khimar as &quot;veils&quot; (instead of a &quot;Head Covering&quot;), and the word جُيُوبِ as chests (instead of neckline/bosom). By doing so, they want to make this argument that although Umar took away the Jilbab from slave women, but it didn't expose their naked breasts, while slave women were covering their breasts with Khimar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this modern translation is wrong, and here is proof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to note that in the verse, the Arabic word جُيُوبِ (singular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart&quot;&gt;جَيْب&lt;/a&gt;) is used. When modern Muslim translators translate it as '&lt;strong&gt;chest&lt;/strong&gt;', then it is wrong. The correct translation of جَيْب (singular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart&quot;&gt;جَيْب&lt;/a&gt;) is '&lt;strong&gt;neckline/bosom&lt;/strong&gt;', referring to the area where ornaments like necklaces are worn. It does not refer to covering the breasts of women, but rather the upper part of the chest and neck. You can find the exact translation of this word on wiktionary (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). 'Chest' is not the appropriate translation, as the Arabic word for chest is &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1&quot;&gt;Sadar (صدر)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. Therefore, this verse only instructed women to conceal their ornaments such as earrings and necklaces by using their headscarves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, many Muslim translators (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/24/31/default.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) didn't show this dishonesty, and they indeed translated these words (i.e. Khimar and Jiyub) correctly as a &quot;head covering&quot; and &quot;Bosoms/necklines&quot;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is written in Tafsir Madarak al-Tanzil, under verse 24:31 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=17&amp;amp;tSoraNo=24&amp;amp;tAyahNo=31&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;كانت جيوبهن واسعة تبدو منها صدورهن وما حواليها وكن يسدلن الخمر من ورائهن فتبقى مكشوفة فأمرن بأن يسدلنها من أقدامهن حتى تغطيها&lt;br&gt;(During the (pre-Islamic) time of ignorance, the custom among the Arab women was) their bosoms were naked due to which their chest and area around it was exposed. And women used to hang their head scarfs (Khimar) on the backside, due to which bosoms (necklines) were exposed. They were ordered (in this verse) to hang their head scarfs on the front side, so that the bosoms are covered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:275&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ &lt;strong&gt;وَالْخِمَارِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped over the socks and &lt;strong&gt;Khimar&lt;/strong&gt; (Arabic Head Scarf)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is written in Tafsir-e-Mazhari, under the commentary of this verse 24:31 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://equranlibrary.com/tafseer/mazhari/24/31&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the Scholars are 'Unanimous اجماع' that this verse is only for the free (Muslim) women ... Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad deemed the nakedness of a slave woman from navel till knees. While Imam Abu Hanifa considered her stomach and back to be a part of her nakedness too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId747240&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamic Preachers: Hijab is necessary for a woman so that her husband does not feel jealous and uncomfortable due to his Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;If woman wears revealing clothing which shows her beauty in front of other males; her husband would feel extremely jealous and feel uncomfortable due to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghayrah&quot;&gt;Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة)&lt;/a&gt;. But with hijab, this is evaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we then ask the Islamic preachers what about the Ghayrah of poor slave women? Why did Muhammad prohibit Hijab for slave women? Why did Muhammad then keep the breasts of slave women naked? There were thousands of slave women in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. Why did Umar Ibn Khattab use to beat slave women who took Hijab, even by mistake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if a Muslim master got lust for a slave woman of another man, then they could simply swap their slave women with each other, and rape them. Tafsir-e-Mazhari is a commentary of the Quran, which is taught in every Hanafi school. It is written under the commentary of verse 33:52 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/swap_slave_girls_mazhari.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Zayd said about this verse {وَلَآ أَن تَبَدَّلَ بِهِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجٍ nor to exchange your present wives for other women (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.52&quot;&gt;Verse 33:52&lt;/a&gt;)} that people used to swap their wives during the era of ignorance ... upon that Allah revealed this verse. &lt;strong&gt;But the slave women are not included in it, and you can swap them and there is no problem in it&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where has that jealousy and Ghayrah gone now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, in the case of the wife of the male slave, even this swap is not needed. If the master gets lust for the wife of his male slave, then he can simply take her away from him and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, he can once again return her over to his slave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5105/&quot; rel=&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot; data-ve-attributes=&quot;{&amp;quot;rel&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;mw:ExtLink&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 5105:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. There is no harm in a man (i.e the owner) taking his female slave (for himself) from his male slave.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is about the Ghairah of a poor male slave, whose wife is being raped by his owner? Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why does Islam talk only about the Ghairah of men? &lt;strong&gt;Why does it not care even the slightest about the Ghayrah of poor slave women?&lt;/strong&gt; Why are they made to be raped by multiple Muslim men in a TEMPORARY sexual relationship without their consent? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam turns even small pre-pubescent captive girls of war into slaves, although they had no role in the wars, and they were totally innocent. And then Islam took away all their Ghayrah, and they were also raped by multiple Muslim men in temporary sexual relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId93010&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'Lowering the gazes' is only an Unnatural restriction, which results only in 'sexual frustration':&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Allah ordered the lowering of gazes in the Quran, and it is also modesty. Men normally lustfully gaze at, look at women(even if inadvertently, without being aware of it) but hijab prevents women getting unsolicited, unwanted looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We absolutely don't agree with Muslim's claim of this so-called 'modesty' in the name of 'lowering the gazes', while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Lowering of the gazes' is also not modesty, but an unnatural restriction upon the women and the men. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Muslim men were ordered to lower their gazes only in the presence of free Muslim women. As far as slave women are concerned, then Muslim men are not needed to lower their gazes and they are allowed to look at them. It is written in Hanafi Fiqh book Fatawa Alamgiri (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Alamgiri_Awrah_slave_woman.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;em&gt; &quot;It is allowed to see the whole body of a slave woman of another person, except between her navel and the knees ... And all that is allowed to be seen, it is also allowed to be touched.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; And it is written in the Book &quot;Al-Sharh al-Saghir&quot; of Maliki Fiqh (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): فيرى الرجل من المرأة - إذا كانت أمة - أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة &lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; A man can see more of the body of a slave woman as compared to what she can see of a man. She is allowed only to see his hands and feet, while a man is allowed to see her whole body naked except for the part between her navel and knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And prohibiting women to talk with men, or both of them to interact with each other is also not modesty, but again an unnatural restriction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These unnatural restrictions result only in the form of an extremely 'Frustrated' society. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And in order to see the real destruction of these unnatural restrictions, please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=100&amp;amp;catid=19&quot;&gt;Incident of Ifk&lt;/a&gt;, where people put the howdah of 'Aisha on the camel, while they thought 'Aisha was present there. But 'Aisha was not present there. This happened while Islam prohibits interaction between men and women, and thus people didn't even say &quot;hello&quot; to 'Aisha. This led to such devastating results where 2 tribes of Muslims were about to kill each other, and Muhammad was close to divorcing 'Aisha, and this whole drama lasted for a complete month. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, let us make it clear that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is the RESPECT of women and their choices, which is counted as modesty. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the Western world is modest. It provided women with protection by demanding that men respect women and their choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slave Bazaars in Saudi Arab in 1964, with slave girls with naked breasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Saudi Arabia had to ban slavery in 1962 due to the pressure of the Western world, still unofficially it continued. This documentary was made in 1964 where you can see slave girls with naked breasts are sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;video width=&quot;704&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; style=&quot;width: 704px; height: 528px;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/slave_bazaar_saudia.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how is it possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;The Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, as Islam prohibited Slave Women from wearing the Hijab or even covering their naked breasts in public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;According to Islam, the Hijab was considered a privilege and honor exclusively for free Muslim women, while slave women were not allowed to wear it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat slave women if they ever by mistake wore the Hijab, and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by wearing the Hijab. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, it is worth noting that Muhammad specified that the 'Awrah (nakedness) of slave women should be from the navel to the knee, while their chests remained uncovered. This meant that there were thousands of slave women who appeared publicly, even in the presence of Muhammad, with their breasts exposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;Understanding these historical facts about Islam could lead Muslim women today to reconsider the necessity of wearing the Hijab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Table of Contents:&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId895120&quot;&gt;Muhammad revived the old custom of Arabia, where only high-status women were allowed to take a Hijab&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId434974&quot;&gt;In the pre-Islamic era, neither free nor slave women used to cover their breasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId580552&quot;&gt;The Quranic Verse makes clear that Hijab was only for free Muslim women against slave women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId89821&quot;&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but it is this respect and acknowledgement of women's autonomy that truly embodies the concept of modesty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId63911&quot;&gt;Role of Umar Ibn Khattab&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId130774&quot;&gt;An excuse by Islamic preachers: But the verse of Hijab 33:59 was revealed during the incident of 'Umar and Sawda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId616740&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab, the second Caliph, used to beat the slave women with a stick if they ever attempted to take Hijab (Jilbab)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId741600&quot;&gt;Please also note the difference between &quot;Jilbab&quot; and &quot;Khimar&quot;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId254524&quot;&gt;All four Sunni Imams are unanimous that the nakedness (Awrah عورۃ) of a slave woman is from the navel to the knee&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId790029&quot;&gt;Slave women were standing in the mosques with naked breasts, during prayers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId828467&quot;&gt;The Hijab is not a CHOICE, but Women must be veiled outside the house in Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId304226&quot;&gt;Prophet Muhammad used to roam around the city in public while holding the hands of the slave girls who belonged to other men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId581033&quot;&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah claimed that 'Awrah of slave women is like that of free Muslim women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId895120&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad revived the old custom of Arabia, where only high-status women were allowed to wear the Hijab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pre-Islamic Arabia, there existed a cultural practice where high-status women were required to wear veils as a symbol of &quot;honor,&quot; while prostitutes and slave women were not allowed to veil themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Elite women in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Byzantine, Greek, and Persian empires wore the veil &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;as a sign of respectability and high status&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_74-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-74&quot;&gt;[74]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria had explicit &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sumptuary laws&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_laws&quot;&gt;sumptuary laws&lt;/a&gt; detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_74-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-74&quot;&gt;[74]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-El_Guindi_7-4&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-El_Guindi-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Veiling was thus not only a marker of aristocratic rank, but also served to&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &quot;differentiate between 'respectable' women and those who were publicly available&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-El_Guindi_7-5&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-El_Guindi-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_74-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-74&quot;&gt;[74]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Muhammad did not introduce the Islamic hijab with the intention of promoting modesty, but rather he adopted the prevailing practices of the pre-Islamic Arabs. His aim was to distinguish free Muslim women from slave women through the implementation of hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId434974&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the pre-Islamic era, neither free nor slave women used to cover their breasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the pre-Islamic era, it was customary for women, both free and slave, in various cultures around the world, including pre-Islamic Arab society, to not cover their chests.&lt;/p&gt;

Asma expressed her disapproval of this, and as a result, Allah revealed the verse: &quot;...And let them draw their coverings over their chests&quot; [Quran 24:31], meaning they should cast their outer garments in a way that it covers their chests, concealing what is beneath them. This was in contrast to the practices of the women of the pre-Islamic era (jahiliyyah), as they did not observe such covering. Instead, women would pass by men &lt;strong&gt;with their chests exposed, revealing their necks, hair, and earrings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Muhammad did was to ask free Muslim women to wear the Hijab, but he PROHIBITED slave women to wear the Hijab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Therefore, even after the verse of the Hijab, there were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad and in public with naked breasts. And it stayed the same way during the 1300 years long history of Islamic Slavery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId580552&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Quranic Verse makes clear that Hijab was only for free Muslim women against slave women&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the consensus of Muslim Quran commentators, it is widely documented that this particular verse was revealed in response to a specific incident in Medina. During that time, people would gather and sit on the sides of the streets, subjecting passing women to harassment and molestation. However, upon the revelation of this verse, the harassment of free women ceased as they started wearing the hijab, which distinguished them from slave girls who did not wear hijab. Unfortunately, the molestation of slave girls persisted, as their lack of hijab served as a recognizable marker of their status as slaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;يقول تعالى آمراً رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم تسليماً أن يأمر النساء المؤمنات ــــ خاصة أزواجه وبناته لشرفهن ــــ بأن يدنين عليهن من جلابيبهن ليتميزن عن سمات نساء الجاهلية وسمات الإماء ... قال السدي في قوله تعالى { يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ قُل لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَآءِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلاَبِيبِهِنَّ ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلاَ يُؤْذَيْنَ } قال كان ناس من فساق أهل المدينة يخرجون بالليل حين يختلظ الظلام إلى طرق المدينة يتعرضون للنساء، وكانت مساكن أهل المدينة ضيقة، فإذا كان الليل، خرج النساء إلى الطرق يقضين حاجتهن، فكان أولئك الفساق يبتغون ذلك منهن، فإذا رأوا المرأة عليها جلباب، قالوا هذه حرة، فكفوا عنها، وإذا رأوا المرأة ليس عليها جلباب، قالوا هذه أمة، فوثبوا عليها، وقال مجاهد يتجلببن فيعلم أنهن حرائر، فلا يتعرض لهن فاسق بأذى ولا ريبة.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;... (In this verse, Allah ordered the free women) to draw their Jilbabs over their bodies,&lt;strong&gt; so that they will be distinct in their appearance&lt;/strong&gt; from the women of the Jahiliyyah and from &lt;strong&gt;slave women ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;And As-&lt;strong&gt;Suddi&lt;/strong&gt; said about the revelation of this verse 33:59 that the mischief-mongers among the people of Madīnah would come out on the streets at dusk and get after the women. The houses of the people of Madīnah [in those days] were very small in size and at nightfall the women would go out on these streets [making their way to the fields] to relieve themselves. These evil people would tease and molest these women. While if they saw a woman who would be wearing a Jilbab (cloak/outer garment), they would say she is a free woman [and not a slave] and would abstain [from molesting her] and if they saw a woman who would not be wearing a cloak, they would molest her by saying that she is a slave woman.&lt;br&gt;And Mujahid said that those women would wear cloaks [in the way prescribed by the Qur'ān] so that it be known that they are free women and the mischief-mongers would not then harm or molest them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حدثنا ابن حميد، قال: ثنا حكام، عن عنبسة، عمن حدثه، عن أبـي صالـح، قال: قدم النبـيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم الـمدينة علـى غير منزل، فكان نساء النبـيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وغيرهنّ إذا كان اللـيـل خرجن يقضين حوائجهنّ، وكان رجال يجلسون علـى الطريق للغزل، فأنزل الله: { يا أيُّها النَّبِـيُّ قُلْ لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَناتِكَ وَنِساءِ الـمُؤْمِنِـينَ يُدْنِـينَ عَلَـيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلابِـيبِهِنَّ } يقنعن بـالـجلبـاب حتـى تعرف الأمة من الـحرّة. &lt;br&gt;Abu Saleh narrated: When the holy prophet came to Medina, he had no house in Medina. He and his wives and other women used to go outside at evening to relieve themselves. And men used to sit on the streets and used to recite poetry (to tease and molest the women). Upon that Allah revealed the verse of Hijab (33:59) so that free women could be differentiated from the slave women. &lt;/p&gt;

One day, some ignorant people approach women and harm them, thinking they were slave women. This was because free women would also go out, and they would be mistaken for slave women, and people would approach them and cause harm. The Prophet (peace be upon him) then commanded the believing women to bring their outer garments closer to them (i.e. to take the Hijab). This was to ensure that they would be recognized as free women and not be harmed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حدثنـي مـحمد بن سعد، قال: ثنـي أبـي، قال: ثنـي عمي، قال: ثنـي أبـي، عن أبـيه، عن ابن عبـاس، قوله: { يا أيُّها النَّبِـيُّ قُلْ لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَناتِكَ وَنِساءِ الـمُؤْمِنِـينَ يُدْنِـينَ عَلَـيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلابِـيبِهِنَّ }.... إلـى قوله: { وكانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَحِيـماً } قال: كانت الـحرّة تلبس لبـاس الأمة، فأمر الله نساء الـمؤمنـين أن يدنـين علـيهنّ من جلابـيبهنّ ، وأدنى الجلباب: أن تقنع، وتشده على جبينها.&lt;br&gt;Ibn Abbas said about the verse 33:59, the free (Muslim) women used to dress same as the slave women. Upon that Allah ordered them that they let down upon them their over-garments (Arabic: Jilbab), and letting the outer-garment means to cover their faces and to tie it on their foreheads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Mujahid (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=59&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;عن مـجاهد، قوله: { يُدْنِـينَ عَلَـيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلابِـيبِهِنَّ } يتـجلببن فـيُعلـم أنهنّ حوائر فلا يعرض لهنّ فـاسق بأذى من قول ولا ريبة.&lt;br&gt;According to Mujahid, regarding the phrase &quot;to bring their outer garments closer to them&quot; (Quran 33:59), it means that they should wear veils that clearly indicate they are free women, so that no immoral person would harm them or have any doubt about their status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir also wrote in his commentary under verse 24:31 of Surah Nur (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=24&amp;amp;tAyahNo=31&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;هذا أمر من الله تعالى للنساء المؤمنات، وغيرة منه لأزواجهن عباده المؤمنين، وتمييز لهن عن صفة نساء الجاهلية وفعال المشركات. وكان سبب نزول هذه الآية ما ذكره مقاتل بن حيان قال بلغنا ــــ والله أعلم ــــ أن جابر بن عبد الله الأنصاري حدث أن أسماء بنت مرشدة كانت في محل لها في بني حارثة، فجعل النساء يدخلن عليها غير متأزرات، فيبدو ما في أرجلهن من الخلاخل، وتبدو صدورهن وذوائبهن، فقالت أسماء ما أقبح هذا فأنزل الله تعالى { وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَـٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَـٰرِهِنَّ }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;justify1&quot;&gt;This is a command (i.e. veiling) from Allah Almighty to the believing women, as a protection for their honor and a distinction from the characteristics of women in the pre-Islamic era and the practices of pagan women. The reason behind the revelation of this verse, as mentioned by Muqatil ibn Hayyan, is that Jabir ibn Abdullah al-Ansari reported that Asma bint Marwan had a designated place in Bani Haritha, where women would visit her without wearing veils. &lt;strong&gt;Thus, their ankles would be exposed, along with their chests and ornaments&lt;/strong&gt;. Upon seeing this, Asma expressed her disapproval. As a result, Allah Almighty revealed the verse: &quot;And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision [i.e., to look down and not to expose their adornment]...&quot; (Quran 24:31).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers often assert that those individuals who engaged in harassment and molestation of women while sitting on the sides of the streets were &lt;strong&gt;hypocrites&lt;/strong&gt;. However, this claim is contested by some who argue that they were not hypocrites but rather companions of Muhammad (Sahaba).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These individuals, who engaged in harassment and molestation, were not addressed as hypocrites in the Quran. Surprisingly, the Quran neither issued warnings nor threats against them, let alone punishments. Instead, the Quran seemingly allowed them to continue their misconduct towards slave women, while providing protection only to free women through the requirement of hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This portrayal of events raises concerns, as it appears that the Quran provided no safeguards for the well-being of slave women, inadvertently granting these individuals a &quot;license&quot; to persist in their mistreatment of vulnerable slave girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId89821&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but it is this respect and acknowledgement of women's autonomy that truly embodies the concept of modesty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, a significant majority of ordinary Muslims today remain unaware of the historical realities and complexities surrounding hijab and its relation to Islam. This truth often comes as a surprise to them, as many Islamic preachers strive to conceal or downplay these aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common for some Muslims to assert that women must wear hijab in order to prevent men from experiencing lustful desires, using the analogy that an uncovered candy attracts flies. However, it is important to recognize that this viewpoint oversimplifies the multifaceted reasons and interpretations associated with hijab within the Islamic tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please see, it was Islam which compelled thousands of slave women to move in public without a Hijab (i.e. without a wrapper). So, the question is, did Islam thus make Sahaba sexually aroused and did Sahaba rape those slave women for having naked breasts in public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but modesty is truly defined by the respect for women and their autonomy to make choices about their lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The Western world, with its emphasis on upholding women's rights and their choices, is a true example of modesty and decency. Yes, the situation on ground is not 100% perfect, but their laws and education go in the right direction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hijab is not modesty, but for 14 prolonged centuries, it has been a distressing symbol of severe discrimination against impoverished slave women.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId63911&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Role of Umar Ibn Khattab in revelation of the Hijab Ruling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is known that Muhammad faced challenges when it came to rejecting Umar's desires and suggestions. Throughout Muhammad's life, there were instances where Umar made wishes or suggestions, and Muhammad later claimed to receive revelations in alignment with those desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern is observed in the context of veiling women as well. It appears that Umar Ibn Khattab played a significant role in advocating for the veiling of free Muslim women, as he engaged in multiple discussions with Muhammad on the matter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:146&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 146&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, following the unfortunate incident of women being molested in Medina, Muhammad claimed that the verses regarding veiling were revealed in accordance with Umar's desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is worth noting that Umar held more extreme views on this matter. It appears that he was not content with the ruling of veiling for women and sought something beyond that. This becomes apparent through an incident involving Umar and Sawda, one of Muhammad's wives, which took place after the revelation of the hijab verses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4795&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature &lt;strong&gt;after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil&lt;/strong&gt;. She had a large frame and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, &quot;O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us,&lt;strong&gt; so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out.&lt;/strong&gt; Sauda returned while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I went out to answer the call of nature and `Umar said to me so-and-so.&quot; Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), &quot;You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those who advocate for Umar's stance, one might question the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should Sawda, or any woman for that matter, bear the burden of constantly finding new ways to conceal herself and endure the added restrictions? What harm would it have caused if people still recognized her when she ventured outside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while Umar expressed dissatisfaction with Hafsa's veiling, he paradoxically resorted to physically disciplining slave women for attempting to wear hijab by beating them with a stick. Furthermore, he even stripped them of their jilbab (outer garment sheet), as we will explore further in this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId130774&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An excuse by Islamic preachers: But the verse of Hijab 33:59 was revealed during the incident of 'Umar and Sawda&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for Islamic preachers to accept the notion that companions used to molest women, which led to the revelation of the Hijab verse. This realization raises questions about the entire religion of Islam and creates doubts in the minds of every person who learns about it. Therefore, they attempt to use alternative traditions and argue that the verse of the Hijab was not revealed due to the molestation of women by companions, but rather during an incident involving Umar and Sawda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:146&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 146&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّ أَزْوَاجَ النَّبِيِّ، صلى الله عليه وسلم كُنَّ يَخْرُجْنَ بِاللَّيْلِ إِذَا تَبَرَّزْنَ إِلَى الْمَنَاصِعِ ـ وَهُوَ صَعِيدٌ أَفْيَحُ ـ فَكَانَ عُمَرُ يَقُولُ لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم احْجُبْ نِسَاءَكَ‏.‏ فَلَمْ يَكُنْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَفْعَلُ، فَخَرَجَتْ سَوْدَةُ بِنْتُ زَمْعَةَ زَوْجُ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم لَيْلَةً مِنَ اللَّيَالِي عِشَاءً، وَكَانَتِ امْرَأَةً طَوِيلَةً، فَنَادَاهَا عُمَرُ أَلاَ قَدْ عَرَفْنَاكِ يَا سَوْدَةُ‏.‏ حِرْصًا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْزِلَ الْحِجَابُ، فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ آيَةَ الْحِجَابِ‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqi` at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. `Umar used to say to the Prophet (ﷺ) &quot;Let your wives be veiled,&quot; but Allah's Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam`a the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) went out at `Isha' time and &lt;strong&gt;she was a tall lady&lt;/strong&gt;. `Umar addressed her and said, &quot;I have recognized (Arabic: عَرَفْنَاكِ) you, O Sauda.&quot; He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;So Allah revealed the verses of &quot;Al-Hijab&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it is clear that any sub-narrator of this tradition made a mistake, while another tradition in Sahih Bukhari (which we have already mentioned above) is also from 'Aisha, where she clearly stated that this incident of 'Umar and Sawda occurred after the verse of Hijab had already been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4795&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature &lt;strong&gt;after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;She had a large frame and everybody who knew her before could recognize her&lt;/strong&gt;. So `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, &quot;O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. ....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is also clear from both traditions that Sawda was indeed wearing the hijab (jilbab), and Umar did not recognize her because of her face, but only because of her tall stature (i.e., Sawda was a tall woman with a large frame). This proves that the verse of hijab (33:59) had already been revealed before the incident involving Umar and Sawda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the verse of hijab (33:59) itself contradicts the notion that it was revealed during the incident involving Umar and Sawda. There are two significant facts that support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, by taking jilbab (cloaks), women cannot be recognized while their faces are covered. Nobody knows which woman is actually inside the cloak. However, the Quran says: &quot;(the women) should take jilbab (cloaks) so that they can be recognized...&quot; (Arabic: يعرفن). Why does the Quran say the opposite, that they can be recognized by using cloaks? The answer lies in the fact that the Quran refers to recognizing in the sense of distinguishing between slave women and free Muslim women. Hence, this part of the verse itself proves that it was not revealed about the incident of Umar/Sawda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, this verse also claims: &quot;... and (these women are) not molested.&quot; Ask these Islamic preachers if Umar ibn Khattab was molesting Sawda. The answer is no. It was not Umar ibn Khattab who molested Sawda, but rather the people who were sitting on the streets, who were molesting the women of Medina. Therefore, this serves as further evidence that the hijab verse (33:59) is unrelated to the incident involving Umar and Sawda. Instead, it stands as a testimony that this verse was indeed revealed about the incident when companions were molesting the women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId616740&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab, the second Caliph, used to beat the slave women with a stick if they ever attempted to take&lt;b&gt; Hijab (Jilbab)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;According to authentic traditions, Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat those slave girls with a stick, who ever attempted to hide their naked bodies by taking Jilbab. He used to tell those slave girls not to try to become equal in status with the free Muslim women by taking Jilbab/Muqna (Jilbab and Muqna, both are outer garments, used for Hijab) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Saudi grand hadith master Sheikh Albani recorded this authentic tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210329003506/http://islamport.com/w/alb/Web/1202/2092.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt; حدثنا وكيع قال :  حدثنا شعبة عن قتادة عن أنس قال : &quot;  رأى عمر أمة لنا مقنعة فضربها وقال :  لا تشبهين بالحرائر &quot; .  قلت :  وهذا إسناد صحيح&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Companion Anas reported: &quot;Umar saw one of our slave girls covering herself with Muqna (which is an outer garment like Jilbab and was used to cover the breasts and body), so he struck her and said, 'Do not resemble the free women.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I (i.e. Sheikh Albani) say:  'And this chain of narration is authentic.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This same tradition is also narrated by Ibn Qalabah (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210920104640/https://islamarchive.cc/H_85618&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Abdur Razzak (d 211 Hijri year) recorded this narration (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210920105238/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=73&amp;amp;ID=4816&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;عبد الرزاق عن معمر عن أيوب عن نافع أن عمر رأى جارية خرجت من بيت حفصة متزينة عليها جلباب أو من بيت بعض أزواج النبي صلى الله عليه و سلم فدخل عمر البيت فقال من هذه الجارية فقالوا أمة لنا – أو قالوا أمة لآل فلان – فتغيظ عليهم وقال أتخرجون إماءكم بزينتها تفتنون الناس&lt;br&gt;Umar once saw a young girl leaving the house of Hafsa (his daughter), adorned with a cloak (i.e. Jilbab) — or, from one of the houses of the Prophet’s wives. Umar entered the house and said, “Who is this girl?” They said, “A slave of ours” — or, a slave of someone’s family. He became enraged at them and said, “Your slave girls left with their adornment, and created discord (by taking Jilbab) amongst the people (while they were unable to distinguish her from the free Muslim women).”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt; And Saudi grand hadith master Sheikh Albani recorded this tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170119173848/http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-22592/page-2084&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;حدثنا على بن مسهر عن المختار بن فلفل عن أنس بن مالك قال: &quot;  دخلت على عمر بن الخطاب أمة قد كان يعرفها لبعض المهاجرين أو الأنصار ,  وعليها جلباب متقنعة به ,  فسألها:  عتقت؟ قالت:  لا:  قال:  فما بال الجلباب؟!  ضعيه عن رأسك ,  إنما الجلباب على الحرائر من نساء المؤمنين ,  فتلكأت ,  فقام إليها بالدرة ,  فضرب بها رأسها حتى ألقته عن رأسها &quot;.&lt;br&gt;قلت:  وهذا سند صحيح على شرط مسلم.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anas bin Malik said: &quot;I entered upon Umar bin Al-Khattab with a female slave that he knew, either from the Muhajireen or the Ansar, and she was wearing a well-adorned cloak (i.e. Jilbab, which was used to cover her breasts and body with it). He asked her, 'Have you been set free?' She replied, 'No.' He then said, 'What is with the cloak?' 'Take it off your head. The cloak is only for the free women among the believers.' She hesitated, so he got up and took it off her head forcefully, hitting her with a whip until he removed it from her head.&quot; &lt;br&gt;I (i.e. Sheikh Albani) say, &quot;And this chain is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Ibn Abi Shayba also recorded this tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210920104640/https://islamarchive.cc/H_85618&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;حَدَّثَنَا &lt;span class=&quot;Rawy_name&quot;&gt;هُشَيْمٌ &lt;/span&gt;، عَنْ &lt;span class=&quot;Rawy_name&quot;&gt;خَالِدٍ &lt;/span&gt;، عَنْ &lt;span class=&quot;Rawy_name&quot;&gt;أَبِي قِلَابَةَ &lt;/span&gt;، قَالَ : كَانَ عُمَرُ بْنُ الْخَطَّابِ لَا &lt;span class=&quot;Gareeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;يدع : يترك&quot;&gt;يَدْعُ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;فِي خِلَافَتِهِ &lt;span class=&quot;Gareeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;الأمة : الجارية المملوكة&quot;&gt;أَمَةً &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Gareeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;التقنع : تغطية الرأس وأكثر الوجه برداء أو غيره&quot;&gt;تَقَنَّعُ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;، قَالَ : قَالَ &lt;span class=&quot;Rawy_name&quot;&gt;عُمَرُ &lt;/span&gt;: إِنَّمَا الْقِنَاعُ لِلْحَرَائِرِ لَكَيْلَا لَا يُؤْذَيْنَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Narrated to us Hushaym, from Khalid, from Abu Qilaba, who said: &quot;Umar ibn al-Khattab, during his caliphate, did not leave any slave girl who could cover herself. He said: 'Covering oneself is only for free (Muslim/Believing) women, so they may not be harmed (i.e. people can differentiate them with slave women and don't harm the free Muslim women).'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The traditions related to Umar Ibn Khattab further corroborate the twelve traditions that highlight the revelation of the hijab verse (33:59) as a means to distinguish between slave women and free Muslim women. These traditions collectively provide supporting evidence for this understanding of the verse's purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;It is interesting to see that such punishments were also present in the &lt;span&gt;ancient Assyrian law for resembling free women:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_law&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;17 &quot;If the wives of a man, or the daughters of a man go out into the street, their heads are to be veiled. The prostitute is not to be veiled. Maidservants are not to veil themselves. Veiled harlots and maidservants shall have their garments seized and 50 blows inflicted on them and bitumen poured on their heads.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId741600&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Please also note the difference between &quot;Jilbab&quot; and &quot;Khimar&quot;:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilb%C4%81b&quot;&gt;A Jilbab&lt;/a&gt; (or  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D9%85%D9%82%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A9/&quot;&gt;Muqna&lt;/a&gt;) was a large outer garment/sheet that was placed on the head, draped around the body, and completely covered the breasts and body of the woman. In the verse of Hijab (Quran 33:59), the author of the Quran instructed free Muslim women to use the same Jilbab to cover their breasts and bodies. Meanwhile, slave women were not permitted to use Jilbab to cover their breasts and bodies. According to traditions, Umar Ibn Khattab removed the Jilbab from the heads of slave women, exposing their bare breasts once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;In contrast, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21134/is-niqab-compulsory#:%7E:text=Khimar%20comes%20from%20the%20word,something%20else%20is%20called%20Khimar.&quot;&gt;Khimar (Arabic: خمار)&lt;/a&gt;&quot; refers to a small headscarf that covers only the head and extends up to the shoulders. Today, we can see Arab men wearing this Khimar (Arabic headscarf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:275&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ &lt;strong&gt;وَالْخِمَارِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped over the socks and &lt;strong&gt;Khimar&lt;/strong&gt; (Arabic Head Scarf)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Slave women were allowed to cover their head and hair by wearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21134/is-niqab-compulsory#:%7E:text=Khimar%20comes%20from%20the%20word,something%20else%20is%20called%20Khimar.&quot;&gt;Khimaar خمأر&lt;/a&gt;. Covering the head was a per-Islamic tradition due to the heat in Arab area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 'Abdul Razzaq recorded in this book al-Musanif (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170115185806/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=73&amp;amp;ID=520&amp;amp;idfrom=4807&amp;amp;idto=4820&amp;amp;bookid=73&amp;amp;startno=6&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عبد الرزاق عن بن جريج قال بلغني عن أشياخ من أهل المدينة أن الخمر على الإماء إذا حضن وليس عليهن الجلابيب&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abd al-Razzaq narrated from Ibn Jarir who said: &quot;I heard from the elders of Medina that when a slave girt started to menstruate, she would cover her head with Khimar, but not wear a Jilbab.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Khimar was not the primary distinguishing factor between free women and slave women, as both groups wore Khimar to cover their heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main differentiating factor between them was Jilbab. Moreover, in the traditions mentioned earlier, Umar Ibn Khattab removed the Jilbab from the slave women, exposing their bare breasts once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId674959&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Looking and touching the private parts of half-naked slave women in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1400 years of history of Islam also consists of this shameful act against humanity, where Muslim men forced those women/girls to become half naked by exposing their breasts, and then forced them to stand in front of thousands of men in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, who not only looked at them with lust but they were also allowed to touch their private parts (as if they were sheep and goats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bayhiqi wrote in his book Sunan al-Kubra (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150909140424/http://library.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?bk_no=673&amp;amp;pid=332183&amp;amp;hid=9985&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

Then ibn Umar came closer to the slave girl, he touched some parts of her body and then said: ‘Who is the owner of this slave girl, she is just a commodity!’&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Shaybani (died 189 hijri year) wrote in his book al-Masoot (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMneWgmvLMAhViEpoKHW7SCq4QFggjMAE&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fislamport.com%2Fw%2Fhnf%2FWeb%2F2217%2F463.htm&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNE4pHhWGCgcmhFFkjVjKhvYhiylkA&amp;amp;sig2=wQtlwzEO1HXOUehof3e55A&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;ولا ينبغي للرجل أن ينظر من أمة غيره إذا كانت بالغة أو تشتهي مثلها أو توطأ إلا ما ينظر إليه من ذوات المحرم ولا بأس بأن ينظر إلى شعرها وإلى صدرها وإلى ثديها وعضدها وقدمها وساقها ولا ينظر إلى بطنها ولا إلى ظهرها ولا إلى ما بين السرة منها حتى يجاوز الركبة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It is not permissible for a man to look at the body of a female slave who is mature or whom he desires, except for what is allowed in the case of mahram (close relatives). There is no harm in looking at her hair, chest, breasts, shoulders, arms, and legs. However, one should not look at her stomach, back, or the area between her navel and knee.&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The slave women of Umar Ibn Khattab used to serve men with naked breasts. Imam Bayhiqi recorded this tradition and declared it &quot;Sahih&quot; in his book al-Sunan al-Kubra (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dorar.net/h/e8a4ee380489a2076c04a6a960ed522f&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; ثم روى من طريق حماد بن سلمة قالت : حدثني ثمامة بن عبد الله بن أنس عن جده أنس بن مالك قال : &quot; كن إماء عمر رضي الله عنه يخدمننا كاشفات عن شعورهن تضطرب ثديهن &quot; . قلت : وإسناده جيد رجاله كلهم ثقات غير شيخ البيهقي أبي القاسم عبد الرحمن بن عبيد الله الحربي ( 1 ) وهو صدوق كما قال الخطيب ( 10 / 303 ) وقال البيهقي عقبه : &quot; والاثار عن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه في ذلك صحيحة &quot; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anas bin Malik said: ‘The female slaves of Umar were serving us with uncovered hair and their breasts shaking”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Sheikh Albani also declared it &quot;Sahih&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dorar.net/h/ffe4e2bb590a45ecd7f7595735686a44&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; This humiliation of the slave woman raises serious questions about the concept of &quot;Islamic modesty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId254524&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All four Sunni Imams are unanimous that the nakedness (Awrah عورۃ) of a slave woman is from the navel to the knee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Even when Islam was not selling the slave women in the Bazaars, still it forced them to move outside in public, with naked breasts, while Islam declared the intimate parts of slave women (‘Awrah) of slave women were from the navel to the knee only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;It is perhaps the “Biggest Contradiction” in Islam. On one side, Islam asked free Muslim women to wear a full-body Hijab, but on the other side, Islam snatched away the right of Hijab from slave women and even forced them to move outside with naked breasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;All four Sunni Imams of Fiqh are unanimous that the nakedness of a slave woman is only from the navel to the knee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanafi Scholar Imam Jassas wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220619124124/https://al-maktaba.org/book/23579/1721&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;يَجُوزُ لِلْأَجْنَبِيِّ النَّظَرُ إلَى شَعْرِ الْأَمَةِ وَذِرَاعِهَا وَسَاقِهَا وَصَدْرِهَا وَثَدْيِهَا&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It is permissible for a non-mahram (non-related) person to look at the hair, arms, legs, chest, and breasts of a female slave.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Hanafi Fiqh book &quot;Fatawa-a-Alamgiri&quot; (which was written by 500 Islamic Scholars upon the order of Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Alamgiri_Awrah_slave_woman.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is allowed to see the whole body of a slave woman of another person, except between her navel and the knees ... And all that is allowed to be seen, it is also allowed to be touched.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId275339&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Shafi'i Fiqh:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is also the same ruling in the Fiqh of Imam Shafii too. See the book &quot;Al-Muhadab fi Fiqh al-Shafi'i, written by Shirazi (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210914182624/https://www.maktabatalfeker.com/book.php?id=2551&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;المذهب أن عورتها ما بين السرة والركبة&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;The view is that the 'awrah (private area) of a slave woman is from the navel to the knees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId983251&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hanbali Fiqh:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitab al-Kafi fi Fiqh al-Imam Ahmed (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210920190743/https://ketabonline.com/ar/books/67936/read?part=1&amp;amp;page=112&amp;amp;index=4187029&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وقال ابن حامد عورتها كعورة الرجل ، لما روى عمر بن شعيب عن أبيه عن جده أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال :  إذا زوج أحدكم أمته عبده أو أجيره فلا ينظر إلى شيء من عورته فإن ما تحت السرة إلى الركبة عورة يريد عورة الأمة ، رواه الدارقطني .  ولأنه من لم يكن رأسه عورة لم يكن صدره عورة ،&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hamed said that the 'awrah (private area) of a slave woman is like that of a man. This is based on the narration of 'Umar ibn Shu'aib from his father, from his grandfather, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &quot;When any of you marries his slave woman or a female servant, he should not look at any part of her 'awrah. For what is below the navel and above the knees is 'awrah, referring to the 'awrah of the slave woman.&quot; This narration was reported by ad-Daraqutni. And because if one's head is not considered 'awrah, then their chest is also not considered 'awrah.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId210102&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Maliki Fiqh:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is written in the Book &quot;Al-Sharh al-Saghir&quot; of Maliki Fiqh (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فيرى الرجل من المرأة -  إذا كانت أمة -  أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة&lt;br&gt;&quot;When a man sees a female slave, he sees more of her than she sees of him, as she only sees his face and extremities. Meanwhile, he sees everything except for what is between her navel and knee because the nakedness (Awrah) of a female slave, in the presence of a non-mahram (a non-related man), is everything except what lies between her navel and knee.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Qurtabi writes in his famous Tafsir of the Quran, Verse 7:26 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://gegasoft.com/quran-reader/en/tafaseer/tafseer-qurtabi/surah-7-al_aaraaf-verse_no-28.html&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“ وأما الأمة فالعورة منها ما تحت ثدييها ، ولها أن تبدي رأسها ومعصميها .  وقيل :  حكمها حكم الرجل”&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;&quot;As for the slave woman, her 'awrah (private area) is from below her breasts, but she is allowed to uncover her head and wrists. It is also said that her ruling is like that of a man.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId775153&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Traditions about the 'Awrah (i.e. nakedness) of a slave woman:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Imam Abdul Razzaq recorded many traditions upon the 'Awrah (i.e. nakedness) of a slave woman in his books &quot;al-Munsif&quot;. Some of these traditions are presented below (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamicbook.ws/hadeth/msnf-abd-alrzaq-011.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13206 - عبد الرزاق عن ابن جريج عن رجل عن ابن المسيب أنه قال: يحل له أن ينظر إلى كل شئ فيها، ما عدا فرجها.&lt;br&gt;Said ibn al-Musayyib said if one wants to buy a slave girl, then he can see whole of her body except for her vagina (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1893_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_287#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13207 - عبد الرزاق عن الثوري عن جابر عن الشعبي قال: إذا كان الرجل يبتاع الأمة فإنه ينظر إلى كلها إلا &lt;span class=&quot;index index-197&quot; title=&quot;الفرج&quot;&gt;الفرج&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Abdul Razzaq reported from Ath-Thawri, from Jabir, from Ash-Sha'bi, who said: &quot;When a man buys a slave woman, he is allowed to look at all of her except her vagina.&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1893_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_287#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13208 - عبد الرزاق عن ابن جريج قال: &lt;span class=&quot;index index-479&quot; title=&quot;الأكل&quot;&gt;أكل&lt;/span&gt; في.... (1) أصدق عمن سمع عليا يسأل عن الأمة تباع، أينظر إلى ساقها، وعجزها، وإلى بطنها؟ قال: لا بأس بذلك، لا حرمة لها، إنما وقفت لنساومها.&lt;br&gt;A reliable person heard Ali (the fourth caliph) being asked about buying a slave woman and whether it is permissible to look at her legs, her private area, and her stomach. Upon that he replied there is no harm in seeing them while a slave woman has no honour. Rather, it is allowed in order to assess her before bargaining (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1893_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_287#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1792 - ( روى أبو حفص بإسناده : &quot; أن ابن عمر كان يضع يده بين ثدييها ( يعني الجارية ) وعلى عجزها من فوق الثياب ويكشف عن ساقها &quot; ذكره في الوقع ) . صحيح . أخرجه البيهقي ( 5 / 329 ) من طريق عبيد الله بن عمر عن نافع عن ابن عمر : &quot; أنه كان إذا اشترى جارية كشف عن ساقها ووضع يده بين ثدييها وعلى عجزها &quot; . وفي آخره زيادة : &quot; وكأنه كان يضعها عليها من وراء الثياب &quot; . ولعلها من البيهقي أو من بعض رواته . والسند صحيح .&lt;br&gt;Abu Hafs narrated with his chain of narration: &quot;Ibn Umar used to place his hand between the breasts of the slave woman (referring to the chest area) and on her private area above her clothing, and he would uncover her leg.&quot; It is mentioned it is authentic report. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in his Sunan (5/329) through the narration of Ubaidullah ibn Umar from Nafi' from Ibn Umar: &quot;Whenever he would buy a slave girl, he would uncover her leg and place his hand between her breasts and on her private area.&quot; At the end of the narration, there is an addition: &quot;It is as if he would place his hand on her from behind the clothing.&quot; It is possible that this addition is from Al-Bayhaqi or from some of its narrators. And the chain of narration is authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi grand Mufti Albani declared this tradition to be &quot;authentic&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130619131945/http://islamport.com/w/alb/Web/1202/2090.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13203 - عبد الرزاق عن ابن عيينة عن عمرو بن دينار عن مجاهد قال: كنت مع ابن عمر في السوق، فأبصر بجارية تباع، فكشف عن ساقها، وصك في صدرها، وقال: اشتروا، يريهم أنه لا بأس بذلك.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdul Razzaq reported from Ibn Ayyinah, from Amr ibn Dinar, from Mujahid who said: &quot;I was with Ibn Umar in the marketplace when he saw a slave girl being sold. He uncovered her leg and tapped her chest, and he said: 'Buy her, showing them that there is no defect in her.'&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1893_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_286#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists TODAY present this excuse that the naked breasts of slave women were only limited to the Bazaars of Slavery, but again they have not a single proof from the Quran or Hadith or any early Fatwa that it was limited to Bazaars of Slavery only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId790029&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Slave women were standing in the mosques with naked breasts, during prayers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;What's more, slave women were offering their PRAYERS with naked breasts. Imam Ibn Hazm recorded in his book Al-Muhala, Kitab al-Rizaa, Volume 10 page 23 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918142619/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=2095&amp;amp;idto=2095&amp;amp;bk_no=17&amp;amp;ID=2053&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;لا يستحي من أن يطلق أن للمملوكة أن تصلي عريانة يرى الناس ثدييها وخاصرتها وان للحرة أن تتعمد أن تكشف من شفتي فرجها مقدار الدرهم البغلي تصلي كذلك ويراها الصادر والوارد بين الجماعة في المسجد&lt;/div&gt;
“He (Abu Hanifa) was not shy to say that a slave woman can pray naked and the people can observe her breasts and waist. A free woman can purposely show the parts of her vagina during prayers and can be observed by whosoever enters and leaves the mosque.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Another Saudi grand Mufti Sheikh Uthaymeen gave this fatwa (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiy2ZLUxqzrAhUD-qQKHRVHBOIQFjADegQIAhAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fislamport.com%2Fw%2Fhnb%2FWeb%2F883%2F452.htm&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2u465KOVbmHFlcD9eyR8M6&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;الأَمَةُ -  ولو بالغة -  وهي المملوكة، فعورتها من السُّرَّة إلى الرُّكبة، فلو صلَّت الأَمَةُ مكشوفة البدن ما عدا ما بين السُّرَّة والرُّكبة، فصلاتها صحيحة، لأنَّها سترت ما يجب عليها سَتْرُه في الصَّلاة.&lt;br&gt;The slave woman, even if she is an adult, and by slave woman we mean a female slave, her 'Awrah (private parts) is from the navel to the knee. If the slave woman prays with her body uncovered except for what is between the navel and the knee, her prayer is valid because she covered what is obligatory for her to cover in prayer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Ibn Abi Shaybah made a whole chapter with the name &quot;&lt;strong&gt;في &lt;span class=&quot;mainsubj&quot;&gt;الأمة تصلي بغير خمار &lt;/span&gt;slave woman will pray without a veil&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and there he recorded 18 traditions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/10/690/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%AE%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Abu Bakr bin Abi Shaybah told us: Abu Usamah informed us from Mujalid from ash-Sha'bi from Masruq who said: 'A slave woman prays as she comes out (i.e. without the Jilbab, which covers her body including breasts).'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Shurayk told us from Abu Ishaq that Ali and Shurayh used to say, 'A slave woman prays as she comes out.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Hushaym told us from Mugheerah from Ibrahim who said: 'Umm Walad (i.e. the slave woman who bears the child of her master) will also pray without a veil even if she has reached the age of sixty.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Waki' told us: Sufyan informed us from Hammad from Ibrahim who said: 'A slave woman cannot take a veil even if she is old.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) Waki' told us: Sufyan informed us from Layth from Mujahid who said: 'There is no veil for a slave woman even if she is old.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6) Waki' told us: Sufyan informed us from Layth from Mujahid who said: 'There is no veil for a slave woman.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(7) Abu Usamah told us from Mujalid from ash-Sha'bi from Masruq who said: 'A slave woman prays as she comes out (i.e. without the Jilbab, which covers her body including breasts).'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(8) Jarir told us from Mugheerah from al-Harith who said: 'A slave woman prays as she comes out.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(9) Abdah bin Sulaiman told us from Mujalid from ash-Sha'bi from Shurayh who said: 'A slave woman prays as she comes out.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(10) Waki' told us: Israel informed us from Jabir from Amir who said: 'There is no veil for a slave woman even if she gives birth from her master.' ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(12) Waki' narrated to us, he said: Shu'bah informed us from Qatadah from Anas who said: &quot;Umar saw a slave woman from our women covering herself, so he struck her and said: 'Do not resemble the free women.'&quot;  ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(15) Abd al-A'la narrated to us from Ma'mar from az-Zuhri from Anas who said: &quot;Umar saw a slave girl covering herself, so he struck her and said: 'Do not resemble the free women.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(16) Ali bin Mas'har narrated to us from al-Mukhtar bin Fulfal from Anas bin Malik who said: &quot;I entered upon Umar bin al-Khattab with a female slave that he knew, either from the Muhajireen or the Ansar, and she was wearing a well-adorned cloak. He asked her, 'Have you been set free?' She replied, 'No.' He then said, 'What is with the cloak?' 'Take it off your head. The cloak is only for the free women among the believers.' She hesitated, so he got up and took it off her head forcefully, hitting her with a whip until he removed it from her head.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(17) Hafs narrated to us from Mujalid from ash-Sha'bi who said: Abu Huraira asked him, &quot;How does the slave woman pray?&quot; He said, &quot;She prays as she comes out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(18) Hushaym narrated to us from Khalid from Abu Qilabah who said: Umar bin al-Khattab did not allow any slave girl during his caliphate to cover herself. He said, &quot;The covering is only for the free women, so they are not harmed (i.e. the free Muslim women could be differentiated from slave women and not harmed by men as they used to molest slave women).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH1&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId828467&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Hijab is not a CHOICE, but Women must be veiled outside the house in Islam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_1hLrLjnE1G_RBCNcN9MVQf&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the huge propaganda today, the reality is, Hijab is not a choice: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;بِاتِّفاقِ المُسْلِمِينَ عَلى مَنعِ النِّساءِ مِن الخُرُوجِ سافِراتِ الوُجُوهِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;By the consensus of Muslims, it is agreed upon to prohibit women from going out with their faces unveiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId304226&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Prophet Muhammad used to roam around the city in public while holding the hands of the slave girls who belonged to other men&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Look at these Muslim men doing dramas of modesty by not shaking hands with women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ak86GqPCSNw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;On one side, Muhammad made a woman's life difficult in the name of “Hijab and modesty”,  practically imprisoning her in her home and cutting her off from the outside world. She was prohibited from interacting with other men, and even if she needed to speak, she was required to do so in a harsh voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;But on the other hand, Prophet Muhammad used to walk in public while holding the hands of the slave girls who belonged to other men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4177&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 4177&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;t1343160&quot; class=&quot;englishcontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;english_hadith_full&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;“If a female slave among the people of Al-Medinah were to take the hand of the Messenger of Allah, he would not take his hand away from hers until she had taken him wherever she wanted in Al-Medinah so that her needs may be met.”&lt;br&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Darussalam)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Please remember that this slave girl was there with naked breasts too, which makes things even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Why did Prophet Muhammad feel the need to hold her hand? Couldn't they simply walk around the city without holding hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;This same tradition is also present in Sahih Bukhari too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6072&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6072&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Anas bin Malik said, &quot;Any of the female slaves of Medina could take hold of the hand of Allah's Apostle and take him wherever she wished.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see these two extreme contradictions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, free women are confined and covered from head to toe in Jilbab, and sometimes even further restricted within the walls of their homes. They are forced to live unnatural lives, where any interaction with men is strictly prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, slave women are left exposed, with their breasts uncovered. They are treated as commodities, allowing customers to touch their private parts like animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This happened while no Allah is present above in the heavens, and a human (i.e. Muhammad) was making the laws in the name of revelations on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Also look at this tradition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2017a&quot;&gt;2017a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudhaifa reported: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;When we attended a dinner along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) we did not lay our hands on the food until Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had laid his hand and commenced eating (the food). Once we went with him to a dinner when a girl came rushingly as it someone had been pursuing her. She was about to lay her hand on the food, &lt;strong&gt;when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) caught her hand.&lt;/strong&gt; Then a desert Arab came there (rushingly) as if someone had been pursuing him. He (the Holy Prophet) caught his hand; and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Satan considers that food lawful on which Allah's name is not mentioned. He had brought this girl so that the food might be made lawful for him and I caught her hand. And he had brought a desert Arab so that (the food) might be lawful for him. So I caught his hand. &lt;strong&gt;By Him, in Whose hand is my life, it was (Satan's) hand that was in my hand along with her hand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH1&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId681614&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'Aisha bathed in front of two Mahram MEN, while the nakedness of a woman in front of Mahram man is also just like the nakedness of a slave woman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the revelation of the verse of Hijab, neither free Muslim women nor slave women covered their naked breasts in public, as it was a custom of the Arabs of that era.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the revelation of the verse of Hijab, free Muslim women began covering their naked breasts and bodies with Jilbab &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Public&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the instruction to wear Jilbab did not apply indoors in front of Mahram men. Therefore, free Muslim women did not covered their naked breasts with Jilbab inside their homes in front of their Mahram male relatives. According to Islamic law, a free Muslim woman's 'Awrah (private parts) in front of Mahram men extended only from her navel to her knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:251&quot;&gt;Sahih al Bukhari, Bab Grhusl Volume 1, Book 5, Number 251&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Salama: ‘Ayesha’s brother and I went to ‘A’isha and he asked her about the bath of the Prophet. She brought a pot containing about a Sa’ of water and took a bath and poured it over her head and at what time there was a screen between her and us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grand scholar Ibn Hajar el-Asqallani, the commentator of Sahih Bukhari, wrote under this hadith (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/52/492/index.php&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قوله : ( وبيننا وبينها حجاب ) قال القاضي عياض : ظاهره أنهما رأيا عملها في رأسها وأعالي جسدها مما يحل نظره للمحرم ; لأنها خالة أبي سلمة من الرضاع أرضعته أختها أم كلثوم وإنما سترت أسافل بدنها مما لا يحل للمحرم النظر إليه&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qadi Ayad says: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is apparent that they could see her actions from her head and the top half of her body, because they were allowed to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as she was a milk-aunt to Abu Salamah and his brother from her sister Umm Kulthum. As for the lower part of her body, this was covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is written in Fatawa Alamgiri (also knowns as Fatawa-e-Hindiya, as it was compiled by 500 scholars from India on the orders of Emperor Aurganzeb Alamgir). &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080103201511/http://feqh.al-islam.com/Display.asp?Mode=0&amp;amp;MaksamID=896&amp;amp;DocID=73&amp;amp;ParagraphID=20362&amp;amp;Diacratic=0&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for looking at his Mahram women (like mother, adult daughter, sister and every Mahram female like the grandmother, child, grandchild and aunt) we say that it is permissible for him to look at the apparent and hidden areas of their adornment, which include the head, hair, neck, &lt;strong&gt;chest&lt;/strong&gt;, ears, shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hands, legs, and face. This is the correct view, as mentioned in Al-Muhit. Whatever is permissible to look at, it is also permissible to touch, look at, and wink at without any barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId666035&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Excuses by Islamic apologists:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few excuses, which are presented by Islamic apologists today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Muslim Objection: There is no Hadith in Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim which tells that slave women were prohibited from wearing the Hijab or their breasts were naked in public&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reply:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is no Hadith present in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim which prohibits slave women from wearing the Hijab or about their naked breasts. But the opposite is also true i.e. there is not a single Hadith present in them which claims otherwise i.e. slave women have to wear the Hijab and they have to cover their breasts. And, there are many traditions found in hadith books (though not in Bukhari or Muslim) that unequivocally show that slave women were forbidden from donning the hijab and their breasts were exposed in public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all Muslim jurists (fuqaha), who came before Bukhari and Muslim (like Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik), they unanimously agreed that slave women's breasts were uncovered, their awrah extending only from their navel to their knees. This practice was upheld without interruption (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/article/183231/the-concept-of-tawatur&quot;&gt;Tawattur&lt;/a&gt;) by every generation of Muslims. In contrast, hadith is relatively insignificant compared to this persistent tradition of the entire Muslim community over centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Imams Bukhari and Muslim failed to document any ahadith on this subject raises suspicion and begs the question: why did they not investigate and refute it by revealing those ahadith (if they existed) that ordered covering the bare breasts of enslaved women? The answer is clear: Imams Bukhari and Muslim were aware of Islam's dual standards regarding modesty, where free women must cover themselves completely while enslaved women were left with exposed breasts. These double standards of Islam brought them great shame, prompting them to ignore the matter entirely in their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do Muslim Scholars react to this objetion?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Muslim reader asked this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do Muslim Scholars react to this objection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be better if Muslim readers of this article ask this question directly from Muslim Scholars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, here is our experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim scholars have attempted to conceal this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, there were some fatwas and discussions about this issue online, but Muslims removed them to avoid raising awareness among people. However, all relevant information remains available in thousands of Islamic books of the last 14 centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunni scholars cannot justify this practice. All earlier Sunni fuqaha (jurists) issued fatwas stating that a slave woman's awrah (nakedness) extended only from her navel to her knees, leaving her breasts exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As compared to Sunni scholars, the Salafi scholars took another approach. Salafists started altogether denying that Islam prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab or kept their breasts naked in public. However, Salafists provide no evidence from the Quran or hadith to support their claims. Their primary argument relies on Ibn Hazm, an early Salafi (Zahiri) scholar who lived 450 years after Muhammad's death. He asserted that slave women should cover their breasts, but failed to provide any scriptural basis (from the Quran or Hadith) for his assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent Salafi (Zahiri) scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qudammah followed suit, offering speculative opinions without any concrete proof from the Quran or Hadith. Their claims carry no weight since they lack supporting evidence from the Quran or hadith, especially given the abundance of contradictory evidence in Islamic texts and the continuous practice of all early Muslim generations. For instance, Ibn Taymiyyah lived seven centuries after Muhammad's death; thus, his unsubstantiated claims hold no significance when pitted against the collective testimony of countless sources describing slave women's nakedness in Islamic societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId581033&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah claimed that 'Awrah of slave women is like that of free Muslim women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Salafi Islamic apologist wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default position is that the nakedness of a maidservant is like a free woman (i.e. she has to cover the whole body)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Sharḥ al-ʻUmdah 1/275&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly&lt;/strong&gt;, please note that Ibn Taymiyyah failed to cite a single Quranic Verse or a single Hadith which claims that the nakedness of slave women is their whole body and it is obligatory for them to take the Hijab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly&lt;/strong&gt;, it is the 13 centuries-long history of Islam where slave women were kept naked in public. It was the Salaf (early) Muslim generations of the first 450 years who &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;unanimously&lt;/strong&gt; kept slave women naked in public. All 4 Sunni Imams were united on this point. There is not a single opposing opinion present in the first 450 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;After 450 years, it was Ibn Hazm (from the Zahiri school of thought) who first went against this Ijma of previous Salaf Muslim generations. Later, he was followed by other Zahiri scholars too like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah&quot;&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah&lt;/a&gt; (died 728 Hijri), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Qattan&quot;&gt;Ibn al-Qattan&lt;/a&gt; (died 623 Hijri), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hayyan_al-Gharnati&quot;&gt;Abu Hayyan&lt;/a&gt; (died 745 Hijri) and the likes of Sheikh Albani in the present century. But all of them were unable to bring a single direct Quranic verse or Hadith which orders that slave women have to cover their breasts, and they are also allowed to wear the Hijab (for example when they are not working).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In the absence of even a single proof from the Quran or Sunnah by those later coming few Zahiri Scholars, other Muslims ignored them and they followed those Quranic verses and dozens of Ahadith which claim the opposite. And thus, the slave women stayed naked for 13 centuries of Islamic history, till slavery was banned in Islamic countries under the pressure of Western powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thirdly&lt;/strong&gt;, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/article/183231/the-concept-of-tawatur&quot;&gt;Tawattur&lt;/a&gt; (the widespread practice) in the actions of companions of Muhammad and Tabi'un (i.e. the Muslim generation which followed companions), in keeping thousands of slave women with naked breasts in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Malik, being a Taba Tabi'i himself in Medina, witnessed the actions of the Tabi'un in Medina, where they unanimously kept the breasts of thousands of slave women naked. It is reported that Malik didn't personally like this practice, but when it came to giving the legal Ruling (i.e. Fatwa), then he also stated that the nakedness of slave women was only between the navel to the knee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only Imam Malik but also other jurists before him witnessed this widespread practice among the Sahaba and Tabi'in. For instance, Abu Hanifa, who was himself a Tabi'i, observed the Tawattur (the widespread practice) among the Sahaba, as &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;they kept thousands of slave women with naked breasts in public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is inconceivable that Malik and Abu Hanifa and all other jurists of their time and before them would have witnessed this Tawattur in the actions of the Sahaba and Tabi'in, and still had gone opposite to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourthly&lt;/strong&gt;, is Allah really All-Knowing? If yes, why then did He forget to mention in the Quran that slave women have to cover their breasts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Allah was UNABLE to explicitly state in the Quran that slave women should cover their breasts, resulting in ALL Muslims of the first 4 centuries being misguided and unanimously agreeing (IJMA) that slave girls should not cover their naked breasts in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the unfortunate slave women had to endure this neglect from the so-called all-knowing and all-wise Allah for 13 centuries of Islamic Slavery's history until Kafir Western intervention forcefully abolished slavery in Islamic countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah filled the Quran, a huge book, with boasts about his powers and praises, yet failed to mention a single verse about the naked breasts of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who should be held responsible for the sufferings endured by millions of slave women for 13 long centuries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islamic preachers: But Imam Malik disliked that slave women move in Medina with naked breasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists also presented this argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malik was asked: Do you dislike a servant-girl to go out bare-chested? Malik said: Yes, and I would punish her for that. (Source: Mawāhib al-Jalīl 1/501)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only Malik's &quot;&lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; dislike, but it has nothing to do with Quran/Hadith and Islamic Sharia. You can see that despite this personal dislike, Malik is unable to present a single verse from the Quran or to bring a single Hadith which claims otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why when Malik wrote a letter to the Sultan and demanded to ban slave women with naked breasts in public, the Sultan denied it while Malik failed to provide any proof from the Quran/Sunnah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maliki Scholar Imam Ibn Abi Zayd (died 386 Hijri) wrote in his book &quot;al-Jameh&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://shamela.ws/book/18260/108#p1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), and also see &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210303222328/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/367498/slave-women-did-not-walk-bare-breasted-during-lifetime-of-prophet-sallallaahu-alayhi-wa-sallam&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وأنكر ما يفعل جواري المدينة يخرجن فيكشفن ما فوق الإزار، قال: قد كلمت فيه السلطان فلم أجب إلى ذلك&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;He (i.e. al-Imam Malik ibn Anas) strongly disapproved of the behavior of the slave women of al-Medinah in going out uncovered above the lower garment (i.e with naked breasts). He said: &quot;I have spoken to the Sultan about it, but I have not received a reply.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that these statements of Imam Malik are themselves going against Islamic apologists, and they are themselves serving as &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;proof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the continuous practice of the whole Muslim society where slave women were moving in Medina with naked breasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, when it came to giving Fatwa about Islamic Sharia, then Imam Malik himself accepted that breasts are not included in the 'Awrah of slave women in Islamic Sharia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find this fatwa of Imam Malik in the Book &quot;Al-Sharh al-Saghir&quot; of Maliki Fiqh (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فيرى الرجل من المرأة - إذا كانت أمة - أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A man can see more of the body of a slave woman as compared to what she can see of a man. She is allowed only to see his hands and feet, while a man is allowed to see her whole body naked except for the part between her navel and knees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't know exactly what led Malik to personally dislike it? But it may be due to a simple reason, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today, we easily feel the CONTRADICTION in Islamic Rulings where free women have to cover their whole bodies in the name of modesty. But when Islam prohibits slave women from wearing hijab and even keeps their breasts naked, then it goes against the concept of modesty. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only we can feel this contradiction, but it may be Malik was also able to feel this contradiction, which led to his personal dislike for it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId464960&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Dishonest Translation of verse 24:31 by modern Islamic apologists to prove that Khimar was also used to cover the naked breasts of slave women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of the dishonesty of some of the modern Islamic apologists. Their deception is where they started claiming that Khimar was not a head covering, but Allah ordered to cover the breasts too with Khimar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.31&quot;&gt;24:31&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَٰرِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ &lt;strong&gt;بِخُمُرِهِنَّ&lt;/strong&gt; عَلَىٰ&lt;strong&gt; جُيُوبِهِنَّ&lt;/strong&gt; ۖ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Dr. Mustafa Khattab]  And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their adornments except what normally appears. Let them draw their &lt;strong&gt;veils&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. Khimar خمار)  over their &lt;strong&gt;chests&lt;/strong&gt; (Arabic:جُيُوبِهِنَّ), and not reveal their ˹hidden˺ adornments except to their husbands, their fathers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, they have started translating Khimar as &quot;veils&quot; (instead of a &quot;Head Covering&quot;), and the word جُيُوبِ as chests (instead of neckline/bosom). By doing so, they want to make this argument that although Umar took away the Jilbab from slave women, but it didn't expose their naked breasts, while slave women were covering their breasts with Khimar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this modern translation is wrong, and here is proof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to note that in the verse, the Arabic word جُيُوبِ (singular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart&quot;&gt;جَيْب&lt;/a&gt;) is used. When modern Muslim translators translate it as '&lt;strong&gt;chest&lt;/strong&gt;', then it is wrong. The correct translation of جَيْب (singular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart&quot;&gt;جَيْب&lt;/a&gt;) is '&lt;strong&gt;neckline/bosom&lt;/strong&gt;', referring to the area where ornaments like necklaces are worn. It does not refer to covering the breasts of women, but rather the upper part of the chest and neck. You can find the exact translation of this word on wiktionary (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). 'Chest' is not the appropriate translation, as the Arabic word for chest is &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1&quot;&gt;Sadar (صدر)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. Therefore, this verse only instructed women to conceal their ornaments such as earrings and necklaces by using their headscarves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, many Muslim translators (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/24/31/default.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) didn't show this dishonesty, and they indeed translated these words (i.e. Khimar and Jiyub) correctly as a &quot;head covering&quot; and &quot;Bosoms/necklines&quot;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is written in Tafsir Madarak al-Tanzil, under verse 24:31 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=17&amp;amp;tSoraNo=24&amp;amp;tAyahNo=31&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;كانت جيوبهن واسعة تبدو منها صدورهن وما حواليها وكن يسدلن الخمر من ورائهن فتبقى مكشوفة فأمرن بأن يسدلنها من أقدامهن حتى تغطيها&lt;br&gt;(During the (pre-Islamic) time of ignorance, the custom among the Arab women was) their bosoms were naked due to which their chest and area around it was exposed. And women used to hang their head scarfs (Khimar) on the backside, due to which bosoms (necklines) were exposed. They were ordered (in this verse) to hang their head scarfs on the front side, so that the bosoms are covered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:275&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ &lt;strong&gt;وَالْخِمَارِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped over the socks and &lt;strong&gt;Khimar&lt;/strong&gt; (Arabic Head Scarf)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is written in Tafsir-e-Mazhari, under the commentary of this verse 24:31 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://equranlibrary.com/tafseer/mazhari/24/31&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the Scholars are 'Unanimous اجماع' that this verse is only for the free (Muslim) women ... Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad deemed the nakedness of a slave woman from navel till knees. While Imam Abu Hanifa considered her stomach and back to be a part of her nakedness too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId747240&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamic Preachers: Hijab is necessary for a woman so that her husband does not feel jealous and uncomfortable due to his Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;If woman wears revealing clothing which shows her beauty in front of other males; her husband would feel extremely jealous and feel uncomfortable due to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghayrah&quot;&gt;Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة)&lt;/a&gt;. But with hijab, this is evaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we then ask the Islamic preachers what about the Ghayrah of poor slave women? Why did Muhammad prohibit Hijab for slave women? Why did Muhammad then keep the breasts of slave women naked? There were thousands of slave women in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. Why did Umar Ibn Khattab use to beat slave women who took Hijab, even by mistake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if a Muslim master got lust for a slave woman of another man, then they could simply swap their slave women with each other, and rape them. Tafsir-e-Mazhari is a commentary of the Quran, which is taught in every Hanafi school. It is written under the commentary of verse 33:52 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/swap_slave_girls_mazhari.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Zayd said about this verse {وَلَآ أَن تَبَدَّلَ بِهِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجٍ nor to exchange your present wives for other women (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.52&quot;&gt;Verse 33:52&lt;/a&gt;)} that people used to swap their wives during the era of ignorance ... upon that Allah revealed this verse. &lt;strong&gt;But the slave women are not included in it, and you can swap them and there is no problem in it&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where has that jealousy and Ghayrah gone now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, in the case of the wife of the male slave, even this swap is not needed. If the master gets lust for the wife of his male slave, then he can simply take her away from him and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, he can once again return her over to his slave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5105/&quot; rel=&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot; data-ve-attributes=&quot;{&amp;quot;rel&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;mw:ExtLink&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 5105:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. There is no harm in a man (i.e the owner) taking his female slave (for himself) from his male slave.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is about the Ghairah of a poor male slave, whose wife is being raped by his owner? Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why does Islam talk only about the Ghairah of men? &lt;strong&gt;Why does it not care even the slightest about the Ghayrah of poor slave women?&lt;/strong&gt; Why are they made to be raped by multiple Muslim men in a TEMPORARY sexual relationship without their consent? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam turns even small pre-pubescent captive girls of war into slaves, although they had no role in the wars, and they were totally innocent. And then Islam took away all their Ghayrah, and they were also raped by multiple Muslim men in temporary sexual relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId93010&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'Lowering the gazes' is only an Unnatural restriction, which results only in 'sexual frustration':&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Allah ordered the lowering of gazes in the Quran, and it is also modesty. Men normally lustfully gaze at, look at women(even if inadvertently, without being aware of it) but hijab prevents women getting unsolicited, unwanted looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We absolutely don't agree with Muslim's claim of this so-called 'modesty' in the name of 'lowering the gazes', while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Lowering of the gazes' is also not modesty, but an unnatural restriction upon the women and the men. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Muslim men were ordered to lower their gazes only in the presence of free Muslim women. As far as slave women are concerned, then Muslim men are not needed to lower their gazes and they are allowed to look at them. It is written in Hanafi Fiqh book Fatawa Alamgiri (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Alamgiri_Awrah_slave_woman.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;em&gt; &quot;It is allowed to see the whole body of a slave woman of another person, except between her navel and the knees ... And all that is allowed to be seen, it is also allowed to be touched.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; And it is written in the Book &quot;Al-Sharh al-Saghir&quot; of Maliki Fiqh (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): فيرى الرجل من المرأة - إذا كانت أمة - أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة &lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; A man can see more of the body of a slave woman as compared to what she can see of a man. She is allowed only to see his hands and feet, while a man is allowed to see her whole body naked except for the part between her navel and knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And prohibiting women to talk with men, or both of them to interact with each other is also not modesty, but again an unnatural restriction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These unnatural restrictions result only in the form of an extremely 'Frustrated' society. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And in order to see the real destruction of these unnatural restrictions, please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=100&amp;amp;catid=19&quot;&gt;Incident of Ifk&lt;/a&gt;, where people put the howdah of 'Aisha on the camel, while they thought 'Aisha was present there. But 'Aisha was not present there. This happened while Islam prohibits interaction between men and women, and thus people didn't even say &quot;hello&quot; to 'Aisha. This led to such devastating results where 2 tribes of Muslims were about to kill each other, and Muhammad was close to divorcing 'Aisha, and this whole drama lasted for a complete month. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, let us make it clear that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is the RESPECT of women and their choices, which is counted as modesty. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the Western world is modest. It provided women with protection by demanding that men respect women and their choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Love is an ultimate Truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;But Islam rejects this natural love between a boy and a girl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;While Islam deems love to be immodest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;There is no concept of Love in Islam, but only SEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Islam condemns the love of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layla_and_Majnun&quot;&gt;Layla and Majnun&lt;/a&gt; (Arabic characters like Romeo/Juliet) to be immodest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;And Islam punishes all the Laylas and Majnuns severely, while they commit the crime of indulging in Natural Love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Islam employs the tools of the Hijab and Islamic Modesty in order to kill this love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Islam is not a religion of nature, but it is a murderer of nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Islam not only  allows Muslim men to have sex with 4 wives,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;but also to have sex with dozens of slave girls in a Shia Mut'ah-type &quot;Temporary&quot; sexual relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;And this temporary sexual relationship with slave girls is not out of any &lt;strong&gt;necessity&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;but only and only for the LUST of Muslim men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islam usurps the right from a small girl to indulge in love, by forced marriage without her consent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam allows the father/guardian to forcefully give a minor girl in Nikah to any man, even if he is 50 years old. The father/guardian does not even need to ask for the consent of a minor girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Bakr gave 6 years old small child 'Aisha in marriage to an old person like Muhammad without even asking her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the most important question is what chance does such a minor child girl have, to become an adult, and fall in natural love with any boy of her own age group? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the answer is, she has absolutely no chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam usurped her right to fall in love completely. And now Islam is forcing her to love only that old man to whom she was married by her guardian without her consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if she is compelled by NATURE to fall in love with a boy of her age group after becoming an adult, then Islam will punish and kill both her and her love for this crime in the name of indecency and immodesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a wonder that despite this oppression, Muslims still claim Islam to be a religion of nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what to talk about a small child girl, Islam does not allow even an adult girl to indulge in love with any boy of her age group. Islam puts complete restrictions upon her for making any interaction with any boy in the name of so-called Islamic modesty and Hijab. She is practically forced to marry a man she has never talked to before and does not know if his mentality and personality suit her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes both Hijab and Islamic decency حياء to be crimes against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excuses by Islamic apologists: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1st Excuse: Love exists in Islam, but only after you're married otherwise it's immoral&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Nature does not care about this so-called custom of marriage. You become an adult, and you fall in love automatically. It is not in our control. Thus, if Islam puts a condition of marriage first, then either Allah has no understanding of natural love, or Allah does not exist in the heavens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And it is not only love, but a boy also automatically starts thinking about the non-Mahram girl in his dream and automatically gets nightfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Surely, the Islamic framework prohibits intentionally even thinking about a non-Mahram girl. But nature does not care about Islam. You become an adult, and you also start dreaming of non-Mahram girls intentionally or unintentionally, and you have nightfall as a boy automatically, and religion (Islam) cannot control this natural nightfall, while its teachings are unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In conclusion, nature does not care about marriage first either for love or for nightfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Islamic apologist claimed that indeed the Quran has a concept of love. And as proof, he presented the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; Surah Rum, Verse 21: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Again, this verse is only about love after marriage. While natural love does not RECOGNISE any boundaries of marriage. You become an adult, and you automatically fall in love. While Allah (i.e. Muhammad) wants to go against NATURE and wants to compel a girl to love only that person to whom she was wed by her father (even without her consent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Therefore, the question is, does this verse answer how a minor girl will indulge in the NATURAL love of a boy of her own age group when her Muslim father had already wed her to a 50 years old man? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And even if she is compelled by NATURE to fall in love with a boy of her age group after becoming an adult, then Islam will punish and kill both her and her love for this crime in the name of indecency and immodesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2nd Excuse: Islam prohibited love and interaction between a boy and girl before marriage in order to avoid paternity issues of the child&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Islamic apologist wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seems unnatural to prohibit love and interaction before marriage, but Islam is not alone in this regard, but it is true of most societies and religions in the absence of effective contraception, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and DNA tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before DNA testing, men had no way of knowing paternity so virginity was one of their biggest concern. And Allah's wisdom in unmatched while Islam achieved this task perfectly by prohibiting love and interaction between men and women before marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A premodern world with high mortality rates, no guarantee of paternity etc wasn't exactly a suitable place for current standards of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a totally wrong assumption that not taking Hijab or both genders having interaction would necessarily lead to illegal sex and illegitimate children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women/37-women-and-hijab/11-islam-prohibited-slave-women-from-taking-a-hijab-or-even-covering-their-naked-breasts-in-public&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;Muhammad prohibited slave women to take the Hijab and even kept their breasts naked&lt;/span&gt; (link)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, there were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad and in public without the Hijab and with naked breasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the interaction of Muslim men with slave women is also completely allowed in Islam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, if Muslim claims that despite non-Hijab and naked breasts and interaction with slave women didn't lead to illegal sex and illegitimate children in Islam society, then why would necessarily lead to illegal sex and illegitimate children only in the case of free Muslim girls and women?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look here how Muslim men were interacting with slave women in Islamic State:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slave women of Umar Ibn Khattab used to serve men with naked breasts. Imam Bayhiqi recorded this tradition and declared it &quot;Sahih&quot; in his book al-Sunan al-Kubra (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dorar.net/h/e8a4ee380489a2076c04a6a960ed522f&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ثم روى من طريق حماد بن سلمة قالت : حدثني ثمامة بن عبد الله بن أنس عن جده أنس بن مالك قال : &quot; كن إماء عمر رضي الله عنه يخدمننا كاشفات عن شعورهن تضطرب ثديهن &quot; . قلت : وإسناده جيد رجاله كلهم ثقات غير شيخ البيهقي أبي القاسم عبد الرحمن بن عبيد الله الحربي ( 1 ) وهو صدوق كما قال الخطيب ( 10 / 303 ) وقال البيهقي عقبه : &quot; والاثار عن عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه في ذلك صحيحة &quot; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anas bin Malik said: ‘The female slaves of Umar were serving us with uncovered hair and their breasts shaking”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Albani also declared it &quot;Sahih&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dorar.net/h/ffe4e2bb590a45ecd7f7595735686a44&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prophet Muhammad used to walk in public while holding the hands of the slave girls of another man in his hand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6072&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6072&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;Anas bin Malik said, &quot;Any of the female slaves of Medina could take hold of the hand of Allah's Apostle and take him wherever she wished.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;This same tradition is also present in Sunan Ibn Majah too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4177&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 4177&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;t1343160&quot; class=&quot;englishcontainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;english_hadith_full&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;“If a female slave among the people of Al-Medinah were to take the hand of the Messenger of Allah, he would not take his hand away from hers until she had taken him wherever she wanted in Al-Medinah so that her needs may be met.”&lt;br /&gt;Grade: Sahih (Darussalam)&lt;br /&gt;Grad: Sahih (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/42955&quot;&gt;Albani&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if the INTERACTION of Prphet with slave girls of other people (and even holding their hands and roaming in the city of Medina) was not the cause of illegal sex and illegitimate children, why then it becomes so in the case of only free Muslim girls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;3rd Excuse: In the circumstances of that era, marriage was not about love, but a business transaction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Another Islamic apologist wrote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It was a highly patriarchal system where women falling in love and wanting to marry specific people was an inconvenience, while marriage was a business transaction. Thus, it was a Divine Wisdom of Allah to prohibit interaction between genders, which could lead to love, and ultimately become inconvinent for them to marry that partner which their families chose for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Islamic apologists are claiming that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evil people had already killed the notion of Natural Love and turned marriage into a business transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Allah, instead of correcting this mistake, also kept on supporting this evil of turning love/marriage into a business transaction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Islamic apologists are at least absolutely right when they say that Islam views love/marriage only as a marriage transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are totally wrong when they boast that it was a Divine Wisdom of Allah to keep only killing Natural Love and keep on strengthening the evil of turning love/marriage into a business transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some comments by the Readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reader wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In virtually all muslims countries especially the arab ones, I constantly notice the social stigma when mentioning the word &quot;al-hub&quot; (love) or &quot;Bahebek&quot; &quot;Kanbghik&quot; (I love you) and it doesn't need much mental capacity to link this stigma with the religion and the culture that was shaped by the Islam itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Perhaps Muhammad never experienced love in his childhood so didn't know the meaning of love as it is in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reader wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its so sad in Afghanistan people still 'sell' their minor daughters to old muslims and see nothing wrong with it. But my muslim western friends say its not true islam..what is the true islam then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reader wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is pure and a natural human state that we as humans have limited control over. We can’t control who we fall in love with. Love is a beautiful emotion, but Islam condemns it as a “sin”. If men show attraction towards women, women are shamed as evil temptresses who “provoked the poor guy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Love is an ultimate Truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;But Islam rejects this natural love between a boy and a girl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;While Islam deems love to be immodest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;There is no concept of Love in Islam, but only SEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Islam condemns the love of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layla_and_Majnun&quot;&gt;Layla and Majnun&lt;/a&gt; (Arabic characters like Romeo/Juliet) to be immodest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;And Islam punishes all the Laylas and Majnuns severely, while they commit the crime of indulging in Natural Love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Islam employs the tools of the Hijab and Islamic Modesty in order to kill this love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Islam is not a religion of nature, but it is a murderer of nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Islam not only  allows Muslim men to have sex with 4 wives,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;but also to have sex with dozens of slave girls in a Shia Mut'ah-type &quot;Temporary&quot; sexual relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;And this temporary sexual relationship with slave girls is not out of any &lt;strong&gt;necessity&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;but only and only for the LUST of Muslim men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islam usurps the right from a small girl to indulge in love, by forced marriage without her consent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam allows the father/guardian to forcefully give a minor girl in Nikah to any man, even if he is 50 years old. The father/guardian does not even need to ask for the consent of a minor girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Bakr gave 6 years old small child 'Aisha in marriage to an old person like Muhammad without even asking her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the most important question is what chance does such a minor child girl have, to become an adult, and fall in natural love with any boy of her own age group? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the answer is, she has absolutely no chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam usurped her right to fall in love completely. And now Islam is forcing her to love only that old man to whom she was married by her guardian without her consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if she is compelled by NATURE to fall in love with a boy of her age group after becoming an adult, then Islam will punish and kill both her and her love for this crime in the name of indecency and immodesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a wonder that despite this oppression, Muslims still claim Islam to be a religion of nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what to talk about a small child girl, Islam does not allow even an adult girl to indulge in love with any boy of her age group. Islam puts complete restrictions upon her for making any interaction with any boy in the name of so-called Islamic modesty and Hijab. She is practically forced to marry a man she has never talked to before and does not know if his mentality and personality suit her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes both Hijab and Islamic decency حياء to be crimes against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excuses by Islamic apologists: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1st Excuse: Love exists in Islam, but only after you're married otherwise it's immoral&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Nature does not care about this so-called custom of marriage. You become an adult, and you fall in love automatically. It is not in our control. Thus, if Islam puts a condition of marriage first, then either Allah has no understanding of natural love, or Allah does not exist in the heavens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And it is not only love, but a boy also automatically starts thinking about the non-Mahram girl in his dream and automatically gets nightfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Surely, the Islamic framework prohibits intentionally even thinking about a non-Mahram girl. But nature does not care about Islam. You become an adult, and you also start dreaming of non-Mahram girls intentionally or unintentionally, and you have nightfall as a boy automatically, and religion (Islam) cannot control this natural nightfall, while its teachings are unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In conclusion, nature does not care about marriage first either for love or for nightfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Islamic apologist claimed that indeed the Quran has a concept of love. And as proof, he presented the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; Surah Rum, Verse 21: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a totally wrong assumption that not taking Hijab or both genders having interaction would necessarily lead to illegal sex and illegitimate children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that:&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Modesty is not concealed within the Hijab; rather, it lies in &lt;strong&gt;respecting&lt;/strong&gt; women and their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MORALS of the Western world stand as an example of true modesty as they educate men to &lt;strong&gt;respect&lt;/strong&gt; women and their autonomy. Although, on the ground level, the Western world is still far away from being perfect, it is in an evolutionary stage where it is gradually moving towards the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in contrast, Muslim men often experience great frustration due to the restrictions imposed on natural interactions between men and women in the name of Hijab and Islamic modesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segregating genders is what causes violent &amp;amp; misogynistic &amp;amp; over-sexualized behavior in men &amp;amp; causes a gap between the genders. Children should be raised to see their peers &amp;amp; others as human equals. When men &amp;amp; women are friends, they develop respect &amp;amp; mutual understanding between them &amp;amp; relate to one another beyond the scope of gender roles. Repressing sexuality makes it so men have intrusive thoughts because they don’t have a healthy outlet for their urges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, even girls with Hijab are still harassed and molested in Islamic countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Hussein Yacoub is a famous Egyptian Islamic Dawah Scholar (He is a Salafi scholar). When he was asked why women are still molested despite the Hijab, he replied that Hijabi girls are molested while they are leaving their eyes, hands and feet uncovered and thus they incite lust among men. He proposed the solution that they should hide their hands in gloves, feet in socks and their eyes in Niqaab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1ls-oVfnMs?si=g1PU8E_QZbH_DUJH&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;But this molestation is not going to stop despite the Niqab, gloves and socks. In the next steps, Islamic preachers are going to tell the women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;You are being molested while you leave the Four Walls of your house and come outside. You are inciting men by coming out of your homes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;But the molestation of girls is not going to stop even in their homes. The sexual frustration among Muslim men will make them molest their girls inside their homes. It is a reality as you will read about incest in Islamic Pakistan later in this article. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The hijab didn't stop Muhammad from becoming sexually aroused&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohammad once called a presumably fully clothed woman in Medina a devil for just existing and became sexually aroused after seeing her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1403a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 1403a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jabir reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw a woman, and so he came to his wife, Zainab, as she was tanning a leather and had sexual intercourse with her. He then went to his Companions and told them: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The woman advances and retires in the shape of a devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please think about it: Why did the Hijab fail to make Muhammad safe from being sexually aroused? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tahrir Square (Egypt) Incident: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident at Tahrir Square (Egypt) showcases the evident sexual frustration among Muslim masses resulting from unnatural restrictions imposed in the name of Hijab and modesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zys959EGXWo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spiegel.de/international/tomorrow/almost-every-egyptian-woman-is-subjected-to-sexual-harassment-a-1198328.html?fbclid=IwAR3KgQUIM-5BM0mrBUDJRU3c2iZpA8M0esNaVDiEf392u73Usz9tItuDr0k&quot;&gt;According to this UNO report&lt;/a&gt;,  99% of Egyptian women have experienced sexual harassment, despite the majority of them wearing Hijab and Niqab. Surprisingly, even small girls who are made to wear hijabs face sexual harassment by Egyptian Muslim men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170406111036/http://egypt.unfpa.org/en/node/22540#:~:text=Also%2C%20the%20research%20%E2%80%9CStudy%20on,sexual%20harassment%20in%20their%20lifetime&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-uw-styling-context=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Sexual harassment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-uw-styling-context=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Sexual harassment is a widespread and serious problem in Egypt, as the country ranks second in the world after Afghanistan in terms of this issue. Also, the research “Study on Ways and Methods to Eliminate Sexual Harassment in Egypt” carried out by UN Women in 2013 revealed that over 99.3 % of Egyptian girls and women surveyed reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime. According to the same study 82.6 percent of the total female respondents did not feel safe or secure in the street. The percentage increased to 86.5 percent with regard to safety and security in public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muslim Women are abused and harassed by Muslim men during the most spiritual Hajj and 'Umra gatherings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the most spiritual Hajj and 'Umra gatherings, Muslim women endure abuse and harassment from Muslim men. There are numerous stories shared by Muslim girls recounting their experiences of harassment during Hajj and 'Umra, which occurs due to the combined gatherings of women and men (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=women+harassed+sexually+during+Hajj&amp;amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;amp;sxsrf=APq-WBveaB_WkezagqihdIsHL5Mwbml4YA:1650247804801&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=vid&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjD68iRxJz3AhVoRPEDHQAGASQQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;amp;biw=1229&amp;amp;bih=585&amp;amp;dpr=1.56&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). This is just one instance where Muslim men and women come together in a shared setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Direct &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/videos/10155631406919440/&quot;&gt;link to this video&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read the testimonies of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220114154056/https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/s3v9fb/sexual_assault_during_hajj/&quot;&gt;Hijabi women here&lt;/a&gt;, how they were molested during Hajj. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hajj and 'Umra represent the most spiritually significant gatherings for Muslims. However, if even in such a deeply sacred place and event, Muslim men fail to restrain themselves from exhibiting sexual frustration, it may be attributed to the unnatural restrictions of Islam concerning the interaction between men and women, under the guise of the Hijab and Islamic modesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, during Hajj gatherings, Muslims engage in behaviours that we non-Muslims do not partake in even during Discos, where music and dance are prevalent. Islam considers music and dance as Haram, leading individuals towards the dark side of Satan. However, contrary to Islam's claim, the truth remains that music and dance do not induce the same level of sexual frustration as observed in Muslims during Hajj gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/08/middleeast/hajj-sexual-abuse-asequals-iwd-intl/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;'I never told anyone: 5 women's stories of sexual abuse at the Hajj&lt;/a&gt; [CNN]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video of sexual harassment during Hajj:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;315&quot; height=&quot;560&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nky5ih99NI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Saudi government takes severe actions against such harassment at Kaba. But it fails to stop such incidents while Islam is going against human nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This is a direct result of the &lt;strong&gt;unnatural&lt;/strong&gt; sex-segregation restrictions of Islam, which is a cause of huge sexual frustration in Islamic societies. You will hardly see any such sexual harassment of girls in trains and Buses and at music festivals in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to unnatural restrictions imposed upon women and their limited interaction with men, Islamic society has reached a distressing level of sexual frustration. Shockingly, in 82% of cases, child girls fall victim to rape by their close relatives, including fathers, grandfathers, paternal uncles, maternal uncles, brothers, and cousins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miss Shandana Gulzar, a Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from the ruling party PTI, discusses the findings of research conducted in hospitals and gynaecologist clinics, which uncovered these alarming statistics. To understand her speech, please enable captions for the English translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIDaJLQBaqM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on social media, Pakistani Muslims responded with strong and misguided negativity towards Miss Shandana Gulzar for shedding light on this societal issue. They unjustly labelled her a Western agent, accusing her of fabricating figures to defame Islam and Pakistan. Some even demanded severe punishment, including imprisonment and a death sentence, for allegedly insulting the religion and the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sexual frustration is very much evident from a large number of cases of rape of small children in the Madrassas (Quran schools).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when girls venture outside, they are subjected to widespread molestation by men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While incidents of sexual frustration in Madrassas and public spaces may receive media coverage, the alarming issue of incestuous rapes within households remains largely unreported. Pakistan is in dire need of a robust &quot;Feminist Movement&quot; to combat these pervasive evils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Even 'Google Trend' is also a witness to the incest trend in Pakistan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani Muslim men have been at the top of the list for the last 2 decades in search of incest terms like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2004-08-20%202017-09-20&amp;amp;q=mother%20rape&quot;&gt;Mother Rape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till the time Pakistani Muslims are not going to give freedom to their women and make natural interaction possible between women and men, their whole society (mostly the small children) is going to pay the price for this extreme sexual frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;However, Islamic preachers deny it. They call it only false propaganda against Islam and Muslims. And they come up with this argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2022-year-in-review&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Pornhub's official statistics for the top 20 countries in 2020.&lt;/a&gt; show that the only Islamic country Egypt just barely managed to enter the top 20s last year for the first time. The USA is at #1 far outpacing the other countries on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is due to the reason while Islamic countries have already banned porn websites. Therefore, Muslims in these Islamic countries reach these porn websites only through VPN, where their IP address is changed from their original Islamic country to a non-Muslim country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a report by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/urdu/interactivity/debate/story/2006/01/060116_reba_diary1&quot;&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/a&gt; (from the year 2006) that 45% of Internet traffic from Pakistan went to porn websites daily. &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/&quot;&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; also showed that Islamic countries were at the top for searching for different types of porn films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2010, almost all Islamic countries started banning access to porn websites. After the ban, the trend didn't stop, and people in Islamic countries started using VPNs to watch porn films, but it became impossible to calculate the data based on the IP addresses of Islamic countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/&quot;&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; is not banned in Islamic countries, thus it is still able to show till today that Islamic countries are still at the top for porn-related searches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dead bodies of girls are taken out of their GRAVES and raped in Islamic Pakistan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frustration among Pakistani Muslim men has reached an appalling level, to the extent that even the corpses of women are violated after being taken out of their graves (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;amp;sxsrf=APq-WBtSvH7ps63b4wIFsRwMyt_b-Tt_ig%3A1646748029197&amp;amp;ei=fWEnYqXNC8qG9u8P0vOu2AE&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl_8G61rb2AhVKg_0HHdK5CxsQ4dUDCA8&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;oq=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6CAguENQCEJECOgsILhCABBDHARCjAjoLCC4QgAQQxwEQ0QM6BQgAEIAEOgoIABCRAhBGEPkBOgUIABCRAjoECAAQQzoHCC4Q1AIQQzoICC4QgAQQ1AI6BQguEJECOgQILhBDOggILhDUAhDLAToFCC4QywE6BQgAEMsBOgcIABAKEMsBOgcILhAKEMsBOgUILhCABDoICAAQFhAKEB46BggAEBYQHkoECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWKc0YKo2aAFwAXgAgAGaA4gB8UCSAQswLjE3LjE4LjMuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Disturbing reports suggest that relatives have had to guard the graves of deceased women during the first few nights in graveyards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you link the Hijab with rape, it follows you to the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And watch this video (Urdu) where one man raped 48 dead women in their graves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/chxsKhXOu60&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In a single year, Pakistan witnessed 2.5 million illegal abortions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous organization &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Population Council&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; published a report (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/2014RH_PostabortionCare_Pakistan.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) of their research, that alone in the year 2012, there were 2.5 million illegal abortions which took place in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please once again listen to the interview of Miss Shandana Gulzar, who sheds light on a distressing reality where hospitals and gynaecologist clinics encounter cases where mothers of sexually abused young girls refuse to file a report with the police. The perpetrators, in many instances, include their husbands, fathers, brothers, or sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;g-row article-title&quot;&gt;Sexual frustration pushing young Muslims in the UK to join ISIS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the full story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/sexual-frustration-pushing-young-muslims-in-uk-to-join-isis-new-documentary-posits-406094&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to teach young boys to respect women, regardless of their dress. Moreover, they should not be segregated from girls. Allowing them to grow up together fosters mutual empathy, so the young men wouldn't even consider engaging in inappropriate behaviour, as they would not want to lower themselves in their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sheikh blames a girl for not dressing properly while her father sexually abused her&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YEjZlACJKJQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcript:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My brother sexually assaults his daughter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'll talk about that in detail. You don't have to continue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sister Um Sara mentioned a person who sexually assaulted his daughter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undoubtedly that's a deviation and obscenity, God forbid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And the girl mustn't wear revealing clothes in front of her father.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Folks, some girls in their youth sometimes have beautiful bodies and such.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And she wears tight clothes like pants and short blouses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And go out and sit with her father. At the end of the day, her father is a man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He may have gotten tempted and seduced by his daughter, God forbid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And maybe when he shook her hand, kissed her, or hugged her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The devil might have seduced him to do some things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I urge every girl, including this one and others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If she was in her young adulthood, not to wear revealing clothes in front of her father.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe she had revealed a part of her breast or such.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because he's her father. But that father remains a man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Therefore, she cannot wear tight or revealing clothes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The other thing is that she shouldn't be alone with her father.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They shouldn't sit alone in a room by themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She must make sure the mother or the siblings are present.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until Allah facilitates her affairs and she gets married.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a father becomes sexually aroused by looking at his daughter without a Hijab, it can be attributed to the unnatural Islamic restrictions imposed by the so-called Hijab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But in Original Islamic Sharia a Muslim woman can expose her naked breasts in front of Maharam men (i.e. her father/brother/son/uncle etc.)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;According to Islamic Sharia, a Mahram can see the whole body of a woman, except for her vagina and buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;A father can see even the naked breast of his daughter,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you rightly point out, it was stated in an earlier detailed article that the nakedness (awra) of a woman in front of her Mahram men (unmarriageable kin) such as the father, brother, son, paternal uncle (father’s brother), maternal uncle (mother’s brother), father in-law, grandson, husband’s son (from another marriage) and son in-law consists of the area between the navel and knees (including the knees) and the stomach and back. It was also stated that as a consequence&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt; it will be permissible for a woman to expose her head, hair, face, neck, &lt;b&gt;chest,&lt;/b&gt; shoulders, hands, forearms, and legs from below the knees in front of Mahram men&lt;/span&gt; and impermissible to expose the stomach, back or any area which is between the navel and knees. This ruling was based on the verse of Surah al-Nur (24-31) as explained by the Hanafi jurists (fuqaha) in &lt;i&gt;al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya&lt;/i&gt;, 5/328, &lt;i&gt;al-Hidaya&lt;/i&gt;, 4/461 and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is also evident from this hadith of 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:251&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 251&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Salama: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;`Aisha's brother and I went to `Aisha and he asked her about the bath of the Prophet. She brought a pot containing about a Sa` of water &lt;strong&gt;and took a bath and poured it over her head and at that time there was a screen between her and us&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani is considered an ultimate Hadith Master by Muslims. He wrote the commentary of Sahih Bukhari. And under the commentary of this hadith, he wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220923133859/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=490&amp;amp;idto=495&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=178&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; قال القاضي عياض : ظاهره أنهما رأيا عملها في رأسها وأعالي جسدها مما يحل نظره للمحرم ; لأنها خالة أبي سلمة من الرضاع أرضعته أختها أم كلثوم وإنما سترت أسافل بدنها مما لا يحل للمحرم النظر إليه &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qadi Ayad said:&lt;strong&gt; It is apparent that they could see her actions from her head and the top half of her body, because they were allowed to do as she was a milk-aunt to Abu Salamah and his brother from her sister Umm Kulthum. As for the lower part of her body, this was covered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet’s wife exposed the entire upper half of her body, hair, breasts, and all. The Muslim Scholars say that this is permissible because the sister of ‘A’isha had nursed Abu Salamah and his brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Background: How is it possible?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There were many cultures present where women didn't hide their breasts. Even today too, there exist such cultures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In pre-Islamic Arabs too, women didn't hide their breasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But there was an old tradition in Arabia, where women of High Status used to take Hijab. That was considered their right and honour, while slave women and prostitutes were not allowed to take Hijab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thus, Muhammad also re-introduced that old Arabic custom, where only &quot;Free Muslim Women&quot; were allowed to take the Hijab. But Muhammad prohibited slave women from taking the Hijab. Thus all slave women were present in public with naked breasts throughout 1300 years long the history of Islamic slavery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But the free Muslim women didn't need to take a Hijab in front of their Mahram men (i.e. father/son/brother/uncle ..). Thus, their breasts were also naked in front of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Later Muslims attached the Hijab with MODESTY. But it was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad didn't introduce the Hijab with the intention of any &quot;modesty&quot;, but his intentions were only to differentiate between the high-status free Muslim women from low-status slave women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;That is why, there occurred a huge CONTRADICTION, and it has become impossible for Muslims to defend the Hijab today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The Hijab is nothing else but a SIGN of the worst kind of discrimination against millions of slave women of the last 1400 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details in this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; Islam Prohibited Slave Women from Taking Hijab or Even Covering Their Naked Breasts in Public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logical Argument: The companions of Muhammad were unable to abstain from illegal sex for only 30 nights of Ramadan and they sinned. How can Muslim youth avoid sinning until they are 30 years old (until they get married)?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;Companions of Muhammad were unable to abstain from illegal sex for only 30 nights of Ramadan and they sinned. How can Muslim youth avoid sinning until they are 30 years old (until they get married)?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Firstly, Muhammad told Muslims that Allah made sex with wives Haram during the nights of the month of Ramadan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But this order of Sharia was totally against “Human Nature”. Even Sahaba (who were beacons of light and Eman) were not able to act upon this unnatural order of Sharia. Thus, they secretly started going to their wives during the nights of Ramadan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thereupon Muhammad realized his mistake, and to correct it, he made the drama of revelation of Quranic verses once again, which then permitted Sahaba to have sex with their wives even during the nights of Ramadan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Surah Al-Baqarah (2:187)&lt;br&gt;“&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting). They are Libas (i.e., body-cover, or screen) for you and you are Libas for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves (by going to wives secretly), so He turned to you and forgave you (for this sin). So now you are allowed to have sexual relations with your wives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/urn/178360&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4508&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Narrated Al-Bara': When the order of compulsory fasting of Ramadan was revealed, the people did not have sexual relations with their wives for the whole month of Ramadan, but some men cheated themselves (by violating that restriction). So Allah revealed: &quot;Allah is aware that you were deceiving yourselves but He accepted your repentance and forgave you..&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;If the Sahaba (who were the beacons of light and faith) were unable to control themselves for 30 nights, how can Muslim parents expect their young boys to abstain from sin until the age of 25 to 30 years (which is the average age of marriage for boys in Islamic countries today)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic apologists present this excuse that Muslim youth should FAST, as Muhammad prescribed to fast to overcome sexual urges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But Muhammad was wrong that FASTING will take away sexual urges. The proof is that the companions of Muhammad were already fasting during the month of Ramadhan, still they were unable to control their sexual desires for only 30 nights, and they sinned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Modesty is not concealed within the Hijab; rather, it lies in &lt;strong&gt;respecting&lt;/strong&gt; women and their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MORALS of the Western world stand as an example of true modesty as they educate men to &lt;strong&gt;respect&lt;/strong&gt; women and their autonomy. Although, on the ground level, the Western world is still far away from being perfect, it is in an evolutionary stage where it is gradually moving towards the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in contrast, Muslim men often experience great frustration due to the restrictions imposed on natural interactions between men and women in the name of Hijab and Islamic modesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segregating genders is what causes violent &amp;amp; misogynistic &amp;amp; over-sexualized behavior in men &amp;amp; causes a gap between the genders. Children should be raised to see their peers &amp;amp; others as human equals. When men &amp;amp; women are friends, they develop respect &amp;amp; mutual understanding between them &amp;amp; relate to one another beyond the scope of gender roles. Repressing sexuality makes it so men have intrusive thoughts because they don’t have a healthy outlet for their urges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, even girls with Hijab are still harassed and molested in Islamic countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Hussein Yacoub is a famous Egyptian Islamic Dawah Scholar (He is a Salafi scholar). When he was asked why women are still molested despite the Hijab, he replied that Hijabi girls are molested while they are leaving their eyes, hands and feet uncovered and thus they incite lust among men. He proposed the solution that they should hide their hands in gloves, feet in socks and their eyes in Niqaab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1ls-oVfnMs?si=g1PU8E_QZbH_DUJH&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;But this molestation is not going to stop despite the Niqab, gloves and socks. In the next steps, Islamic preachers are going to tell the women:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;You are being molested while you leave the Four Walls of your house and come outside. You are inciting men by coming out of your homes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;But the molestation of girls is not going to stop even in their homes. The sexual frustration among Muslim men will make them molest their girls inside their homes. It is a reality as you will read about incest in Islamic Pakistan later in this article. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The hijab didn't stop Muhammad from becoming sexually aroused&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohammad once called a presumably fully clothed woman in Medina a devil for just existing and became sexually aroused after seeing her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1403a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 1403a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jabir reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw a woman, and so he came to his wife, Zainab, as she was tanning a leather and had sexual intercourse with her. He then went to his Companions and told them: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The woman advances and retires in the shape of a devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should come to his wife, for that will repel what he feels in his heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please think about it: Why did the Hijab fail to make Muhammad safe from being sexually aroused? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tahrir Square (Egypt) Incident: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident at Tahrir Square (Egypt) showcases the evident sexual frustration among Muslim masses resulting from unnatural restrictions imposed in the name of Hijab and modesty.&lt;/p&gt;

Surprisingly, even small girls who are made to wear hijabs face sexual harassment by Egyptian Muslim men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170406111036/http://egypt.unfpa.org/en/node/22540#:~:text=Also%2C%20the%20research%20%E2%80%9CStudy%20on,sexual%20harassment%20in%20their%20lifetime&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-uw-styling-context=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Sexual harassment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-uw-styling-context=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Sexual harassment is a widespread and serious problem in Egypt, as the country ranks second in the world after Afghanistan in terms of this issue. Also, the research “Study on Ways and Methods to Eliminate Sexual Harassment in Egypt” carried out by UN Women in 2013 revealed that over 99.3 % of Egyptian girls and women surveyed reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime. According to the same study 82.6 percent of the total female respondents did not feel safe or secure in the street. The percentage increased to 86.5 percent with regard to safety and security in public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muslim Women are abused and harassed by Muslim men during the most spiritual Hajj and 'Umra gatherings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the most spiritual Hajj and 'Umra gatherings, Muslim women endure abuse and harassment from Muslim men. There are numerous stories shared by Muslim girls recounting their experiences of harassment during Hajj and 'Umra, which occurs due to the combined gatherings of women and men (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=women+harassed+sexually+during+Hajj&amp;amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;amp;sxsrf=APq-WBveaB_WkezagqihdIsHL5Mwbml4YA:1650247804801&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=vid&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjD68iRxJz3AhVoRPEDHQAGASQQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;amp;biw=1229&amp;amp;bih=585&amp;amp;dpr=1.56&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). This is just one instance where Muslim men and women come together in a shared setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hajj and 'Umra represent the most spiritually significant gatherings for Muslims. However, if even in such a deeply sacred place and event, Muslim men fail to restrain themselves from exhibiting sexual frustration, it may be attributed to the unnatural restrictions of Islam concerning the interaction between men and women, under the guise of the Hijab and Islamic modesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, during Hajj gatherings, Muslims engage in behaviours that we non-Muslims do not partake in even during Discos, where music and dance are prevalent. Islam considers music and dance as Haram, leading individuals towards the dark side of Satan. However, contrary to Islam's claim, the truth remains that music and dance do not induce the same level of sexual frustration as observed in Muslims during Hajj gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;315&quot; height=&quot;560&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nky5ih99NI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Saudi government takes severe actions against such harassment at Kaba. But it fails to stop such incidents while Islam is going against human nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This is a direct result of the &lt;strong&gt;unnatural&lt;/strong&gt; sex-segregation restrictions of Islam, which is a cause of huge sexual frustration in Islamic societies. You will hardly see any such sexual harassment of girls in trains and Buses and at music festivals in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to unnatural restrictions imposed upon women and their limited interaction with men, Islamic society has reached a distressing level of sexual frustration. Shockingly, in 82% of cases, child girls fall victim to rape by their close relatives, including fathers, grandfathers, paternal uncles, maternal uncles, brothers, and cousins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miss Shandana Gulzar, a Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from the ruling party PTI, discusses the findings of research conducted in hospitals and gynaecologist clinics, which uncovered these alarming statistics. To understand her speech, please enable captions for the English translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt; &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIDaJLQBaqM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on social media, Pakistani Muslims responded with strong and misguided negativity towards Miss Shandana Gulzar for shedding light on this societal issue. They unjustly labelled her a Western agent, accusing her of fabricating figures to defame Islam and Pakistan. Some even demanded severe punishment, including imprisonment and a death sentence, for allegedly insulting the religion and the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sexual frustration is very much evident from a large number of cases of rape of small children in the Madrassas (Quran schools).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when girls venture outside, they are subjected to widespread molestation by men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While incidents of sexual frustration in Madrassas and public spaces may receive media coverage, the alarming issue of incestuous rapes within households remains largely unreported. Pakistan is in dire need of a robust &quot;Feminist Movement&quot; to combat these pervasive evils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Even 'Google Trend' is also a witness to the incest trend in Pakistan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani Muslim men have been at the top of the list for the last 2 decades in search of incest terms like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till the time Pakistani Muslims are not going to give freedom to their women and make natural interaction possible between women and men, their whole society (mostly the small children) is going to pay the price for this extreme sexual frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;However, Islamic preachers deny it. They call it only false propaganda against Islam and Muslims. And they come up with this argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2022-year-in-review&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Pornhub's official statistics for the top 20 countries in 2020.&lt;/a&gt; show that the only Islamic country Egypt just barely managed to enter the top 20s last year for the first time. The USA is at #1 far outpacing the other countries on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is due to the reason while Islamic countries have already banned porn websites. Therefore, Muslims in these Islamic countries reach these porn websites only through VPN, where their IP address is changed from their original Islamic country to a non-Muslim country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a report by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/urdu/interactivity/debate/story/2006/01/060116_reba_diary1&quot;&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/a&gt; (from the year 2006) that 45% of Internet traffic from Pakistan went to porn websites daily. &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/&quot;&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; also showed that Islamic countries were at the top for searching for different types of porn films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2010, almost all Islamic countries started banning access to porn websites. After the ban, the trend didn't stop, and people in Islamic countries started using VPNs to watch porn films, but it became impossible to calculate the data based on the IP addresses of Islamic countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/&quot;&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; is not banned in Islamic countries, thus it is still able to show till today that Islamic countries are still at the top for porn-related searches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dead bodies of girls are taken out of their GRAVES and raped in Islamic Pakistan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frustration among Pakistani Muslim men has reached an appalling level, to the extent that even the corpses of women are violated after being taken out of their graves (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;amp;sxsrf=APq-WBtSvH7ps63b4wIFsRwMyt_b-Tt_ig%3A1646748029197&amp;amp;ei=fWEnYqXNC8qG9u8P0vOu2AE&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl_8G61rb2AhVKg_0HHdK5CxsQ4dUDCA8&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;oq=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6CAguENQCEJECOgsILhCABBDHARCjAjoLCC4QgAQQxwEQ0QM6BQgAEIAEOgoIABCRAhBGEPkBOgUIABCRAjoECAAQQzoHCC4Q1AIQQzoICC4QgAQQ1AI6BQguEJECOgQILhBDOggILhDUAhDLAToFCC4QywE6BQgAEMsBOgcIABAKEMsBOgcILhAKEMsBOgUILhCABDoICAAQFhAKEB46BggAEBYQHkoECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWKc0YKo2aAFwAXgAgAGaA4gB8UCSAQswLjE3LjE4LjMuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Disturbing reports suggest that relatives have had to guard the graves of deceased women during the first few nights in graveyards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you link the Hijab with rape, it follows you to the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And watch this video (Urdu) where one man raped 48 dead women in their graves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/chxsKhXOu60&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In a single year, Pakistan witnessed 2.5 million illegal abortions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous organization &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Population Council&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; published a report (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/2014RH_PostabortionCare_Pakistan.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) of their research, that alone in the year 2012, there were 2.5 million illegal abortions which took place in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please once again listen to the interview of Miss Shandana Gulzar, who sheds light on a distressing reality where hospitals and gynaecologist clinics encounter cases where mothers of sexually abused young girls refuse to file a report with the police. The perpetrators, in many instances, include their husbands, fathers, brothers, or sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;g-row article-title&quot;&gt;Sexual frustration pushing young Muslims in the UK to join ISIS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the full story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/sexual-frustration-pushing-young-muslims-in-uk-to-join-isis-new-documentary-posits-406094&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to teach young boys to respect women, regardless of their dress. Moreover, they should not be segregated from girls. Allowing them to grow up together fosters mutual empathy, so the young men wouldn't even consider engaging in inappropriate behaviour, as they would not want to lower themselves in their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sheikh blames a girl for not dressing properly while her father sexually abused her&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YEjZlACJKJQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcript:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My brother sexually assaults his daughter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'll talk about that in detail. You don't have to continue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sister Um Sara mentioned a person who sexually assaulted his daughter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undoubtedly that's a deviation and obscenity, God forbid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And the girl mustn't wear revealing clothes in front of her father.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Folks, some girls in their youth sometimes have beautiful bodies and such.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And she wears tight clothes like pants and short blouses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And go out and sit with her father. At the end of the day, her father is a man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He may have gotten tempted and seduced by his daughter, God forbid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And maybe when he shook her hand, kissed her, or hugged her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The devil might have seduced him to do some things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I urge every girl, including this one and others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If she was in her young adulthood, not to wear revealing clothes in front of her father.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe she had revealed a part of her breast or such.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because he's her father. But that father remains a man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Therefore, she cannot wear tight or revealing clothes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The other thing is that she shouldn't be alone with her father.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They shouldn't sit alone in a room by themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She must make sure the mother or the siblings are present.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until Allah facilitates her affairs and she gets married.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a father becomes sexually aroused by looking at his daughter without a Hijab, it can be attributed to the unnatural Islamic restrictions imposed by the so-called Hijab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But in Original Islamic Sharia a Muslim woman can expose her naked breasts in front of Maharam men (i.e. her father/brother/son/uncle etc.)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;According to Islamic Sharia, a Mahram can see the whole body of a woman, except for her vagina and buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;A father can see even the naked breast of his daughter,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;and a son can also see the naked breasts of his mother,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;and a brother can also see the naked breasts of his sister.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;and a nephew/uncle can also see the naked breasts of their aunt/niece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the following fatwa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you rightly point out, it was stated in an earlier detailed article that the nakedness (awra) of a woman in front of her Mahram men (unmarriageable kin) such as the father, brother, son, paternal uncle (father’s brother), maternal uncle (mother’s brother), father in-law, grandson, husband’s son (from another marriage) and son in-law consists of the area between the navel and knees (including the knees) and the stomach and back. It was also stated that as a consequence&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt; it will be permissible for a woman to expose her head, hair, face, neck, &lt;b&gt;chest,&lt;/b&gt; shoulders, hands, forearms, and legs from below the knees in front of Mahram men&lt;/span&gt; and impermissible to expose the stomach, back or any area which is between the navel and knees. This ruling was based on the verse of Surah al-Nur (24-31) as explained by the Hanafi jurists (fuqaha) in &lt;i&gt;al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya&lt;/i&gt;, 5/328, &lt;i&gt;al-Hidaya&lt;/i&gt;, 4/461 and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is also evident from this hadith of 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:251&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 251&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Salama: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;`Aisha's brother and I went to `Aisha and he asked her about the bath of the Prophet. She brought a pot containing about a Sa` of water &lt;strong&gt;and took a bath and poured it over her head and at that time there was a screen between her and us&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani is considered an ultimate Hadith Master by Muslims. He wrote the commentary of Sahih Bukhari. And under the commentary of this hadith, he wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220923133859/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=490&amp;amp;idto=495&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=178&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; قال القاضي عياض : ظاهره أنهما رأيا عملها في رأسها وأعالي جسدها مما يحل نظره للمحرم ; لأنها خالة أبي سلمة من الرضاع أرضعته أختها أم كلثوم وإنما سترت أسافل بدنها مما لا يحل للمحرم النظر إليه &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qadi Ayad said:&lt;strong&gt; It is apparent that they could see her actions from her head and the top half of her body, because they were allowed to do as she was a milk-aunt to Abu Salamah and his brother from her sister Umm Kulthum. As for the lower part of her body, this was covered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet’s wife exposed the entire upper half of her body, hair, breasts, and all. The Muslim Scholars say that this is permissible because the sister of ‘A’isha had nursed Abu Salamah and his brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Background: How is it possible?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There were many cultures present where women didn't hide their breasts. Even today too, there exist such cultures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In pre-Islamic Arabs too, women didn't hide their breasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But there was an old tradition in Arabia, where women of High Status used to take Hijab. That was considered their right and honour, while slave women and prostitutes were not allowed to take Hijab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thus, Muhammad also re-introduced that old Arabic custom, where only &quot;Free Muslim Women&quot; were allowed to take the Hijab. But Muhammad prohibited slave women from taking the Hijab. Thus all slave women were present in public with naked breasts throughout 1300 years long the history of Islamic slavery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But the free Muslim women didn't need to take a Hijab in front of their Mahram men (i.e. father/son/brother/uncle ..). Thus, their breasts were also naked in front of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Later Muslims attached the Hijab with MODESTY. But it was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad didn't introduce the Hijab with the intention of any &quot;modesty&quot;, but his intentions were only to differentiate between the high-status free Muslim women from low-status slave women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;That is why, there occurred a huge CONTRADICTION, and it has become impossible for Muslims to defend the Hijab today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The Hijab is nothing else but a SIGN of the worst kind of discrimination against millions of slave women of the last 1400 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details in this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; Islam Prohibited Slave Women from Taking Hijab or Even Covering Their Naked Breasts in Public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logical Argument: The companions of Muhammad were unable to abstain from illegal sex for only 30 nights of Ramadan and they sinned. How can Muslim youth avoid sinning until they are 30 years old (until they get married)?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;Companions of Muhammad were unable to abstain from illegal sex for only 30 nights of Ramadan and they sinned. How can Muslim youth avoid sinning until they are 30 years old (until they get married)?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Firstly, Muhammad told Muslims that Allah made sex with wives Haram during the nights of the month of Ramadan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But this order of Sharia was totally against “Human Nature”. Even Sahaba (who were beacons of light and Eman) were not able to act upon this unnatural order of Sharia. Thus, they secretly started going to their wives during the nights of Ramadan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thereupon Muhammad realized his mistake, and to correct it, he made the drama of revelation of Quranic verses once again, which then permitted Sahaba to have sex with their wives even during the nights of Ramadan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Surah Al-Baqarah (2:187)&lt;br&gt;“&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting). They are Libas (i.e., body-cover, or screen) for you and you are Libas for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves (by going to wives secretly), so He turned to you and forgave you (for this sin). So now you are allowed to have sexual relations with your wives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/urn/178360&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4508&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Narrated Al-Bara': When the order of compulsory fasting of Ramadan was revealed, the people did not have sexual relations with their wives for the whole month of Ramadan, but some men cheated themselves (by violating that restriction). So Allah revealed: &quot;Allah is aware that you were deceiving yourselves but He accepted your repentance and forgave you..&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;If the Sahaba (who were the beacons of light and faith) were unable to control themselves for 30 nights, how can Muslim parents expect their young boys to abstain from sin until the age of 25 to 30 years (which is the average age of marriage for boys in Islamic countries today)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic apologists present this excuse that Muslim youth should FAST, as Muhammad prescribed to fast to overcome sexual urges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But Muhammad was wrong that FASTING will take away sexual urges. The proof is that the companions of Muhammad were already fasting during the month of Ramadhan, still they were unable to control their sexual desires for only 30 nights, and they sinned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to respect for religion, the harms of the Hijab have not been discussed for the last 1400 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to modern information technology, Hijabi women have been able to discuss their experiences on the internet and discover the potential negative consequences of wearing a Hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hijab is UNNATURAL, and indeed Islam is absolutely not a religion of nature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId221211&quot;&gt;(4) Vitamin D deficiency:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId275956&quot;&gt;Vitamin D is not produced under any cloth (like Hijab)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId401392&quot;&gt;You are hurting your baby girls by confining them into Hijab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId460701&quot;&gt;Vitamin D supplements are not as good as natural sun-rays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId159284&quot;&gt;Allah is still guilty of vitamin D deficiency in the women of the last 1400 years and those poor women who cannot afford to buy supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId694558&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) Sweating, Fungi, Bacteria, Sticky hair, Bad Odour, Scratching, Dandruff, Candida:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tight under-cap creates a hot, humid (sweat!) atmosphere which is a paradise for fungi and bacteria which is the death of hair follicles. Tons of hijabis suffer from seborrheic dermatitis or folliculitis and you can treat it as much as you want, when you give the culprits the perfect biotope to spread and multiply you will not get rid of it! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Lq5qzZxLrLgJ:repository.uhamka.ac.id/3427/1/artikel%2520ice%2520stem%2520Dan%2520Loa%2520Husnin%2520Nahry%2520Yarza.pdf&amp;amp;cd=11&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=de&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On hot summer days, women who wear hijabs often experience a sticky feeling, followed by a bad odour. And this ordeal becomes exponentially high the longer one stays out of the home (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210804000239/https://www.marham.pk/healthblog/hey-you-hijabis-heres-how-you-can-keep-your-hair-fresh-in-summers/#:%7E:text=Often%2C%20women%20put%20their%20hijab,a%20swarming%20invasion%20by%20lice.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you realise it or not, your head constantly sweats under your hijab. It leads to becoming warmer and warmer which is the perfect environment for germs and bacteria. Consequently, you keep scratching your head every now and then (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210804000239/https://www.marham.pk/healthblog/hey-you-hijabis-heres-how-you-can-keep-your-hair-fresh-in-summers/#:%7E:text=Often%2C%20women%20put%20their%20hijab,a%20swarming%20invasion%20by%20lice.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human hair is also known as a storehouse for Staphylococcus aureus. From WHO data, this problem is one of the serious problems of concern. From several facts, it was found that they are seriously harmful to human health. Besides that, one other type of fungus that is often in the hair is Candida. The repetitive use of the Hijab can leave microorganisms and bacteria so that it can cause unwanted things and problems with hair, face, dandruff and other serious problems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409043114/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Lq5qzZxLrLgJ:repository.uhamka.ac.id/3427/1/artikel%2520ice%2520stem%2520Dan%2520Loa%2520Husnin%2520Nahry%2520Yarza.pdf&amp;amp;cd=11&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=de&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study in Indonesia showed that a very high number of women (i.e. 59.4%), who were wearing hijab, complained of hair problems, scalp, itching and allergies on the scalp and areas around the face (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409043114/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Lq5qzZxLrLgJ:repository.uhamka.ac.id/3427/1/artikel%2520ice%2520stem%2520Dan%2520Loa%2520Husnin%2520Nahry%2520Yarza.pdf&amp;amp;cd=11&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=de&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId67194&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2)  Hair loss, Baldness, Receding Hairline, Thinning of Hairs due to Hijab alopecia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Do you know what &lt;strong&gt;hijab alopecia&lt;/strong&gt; is? Also known by the scientific term, traction alopecia, it’s caused by the intense friction from the hijab. The hairstyle underneath, combined with how the fabric is placed and rubs against your scalp every day over very prolonged periods, can traumatise your hair and damage the follicle, resulting in hair loss! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409084455/https://www.havehalalwilltravel.com/beijing-101-hijab-alopecia-hair-care&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Out of the 67% of respondents who wear hijabs, a whopping 79% said they faced hair loss! &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409084455/https://www.havehalalwilltravel.com/beijing-101-hijab-alopecia-hair-care&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Many Hijabi women report having issues like &lt;strong&gt;forehead acne&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;thinning hair&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://edit.sundayriley.com/your-hijab-might-be-causing-you-to-lose-hair-heres-what-the-experts-have-to-say/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receding Hairline: &lt;/strong&gt;There are many reasons for a receding hairline. “One is traction alopecia which is what occurs when there is chronic friction or tension placed on hair roots for an extended period of time. If the hijab is pulling at the hair roots for years, this can result in the hair roots experiencing too much tension and dying,” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://edit.sundayriley.com/your-hijab-might-be-causing-you-to-lose-hair-heres-what-the-experts-have-to-say/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many girls and young women who, combined with hormonal issues, ended up with such horrible hairlines (even actual baldness) that they decided to wear hijab for aesthetic (not religious) purposes (i.e. they want to hide their forehead acne, thinning of hair, sticky hair etc. even from other women). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black women and women with curly hair face the most difficult situation. A  Hijabi girl wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hated wearing hijab, I have naturallly curly dry hair so wearing the hijab always made my scalp so itchy and I got scalp fungal infections, dandruff and flakes. Even with treatments it'd improve a little then become worse again because I was always wearing the hijab, it was obviously much worse in the summer. My parents forced me to wear it from the age of 7 years old and was never allowed to take it off unless I was just with my family. I hated doing sports whilst wearing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;A Black woman was interviewed to inform the audience about the life of wearing hijab, and she was asked this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;“ What do you wish more people knew about being a hijabi?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;She responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;That we are balding for the sake of Allah. Imma need my edges back in [heaven] for real, for real.” (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/amatullahshaw/black-hijabi-haircare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.buzzfeed.com/amatullahshaw/black-hijabi-haircare#&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The fact that this poor girl, who suffered from these ailments as a result of the hijab, wished for Allah to give her hair back in heaven is so sad. It is so sad that they actually think such an entity, if it really exists, would actually do such a thing and not just burn them alive in hell for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId805540&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Stiffness and Pain in Neck and Head  Caused by Hijab, and relief from it after removing it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was done in Islamic Pakistan (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409170346/https://www.rmj.org.pk/fulltext/27-1533115724.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; To identify the frequency of neck pain associated with modern hijab in females of twin cities of Pakistan along with identification of risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt; A total of 747 females participated from 4 different Universities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad (Pakistan) were included in the study. The study duration was 6 months from January to June 2017. Northwick questionnaire for neck pain was used to assess the neck pain intensity, symptoms, numbness, impact on daily activities and social life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of 747 participants, 393(50.2%) females were covering their head with modern hijab. Type of head cover daily duration of hijab were significantly associated with stiffness or discomfort in neck, restriction with movement, pain and stiffness in head and neck region and relief from pain after removal of hijab (p&amp;lt;0.05). Intensity of pain, sleeping and pain, symptoms duration, carrying and reading or watching TV did not show any significant relationship with the type of head cover (p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ex-Hijabi wrote about migraine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I would also like to add, as someone who wore Hijab from age 6 to 19, the tight undercap was a definitive trigger for migraines. Me and my mom are prone to migraines, and Hijab always makes it really bad, especially if I'm outside for hours, having to move around a lot. The pressure squeezing my head constantly is a recipe for a migraine that lasts for hours. I had frequent migraines in college when I was in college. My migraines decreased significantly in frequency and intensity when I took off Hijab, esp that feeling of suffocation and the psychological effect of feeling like u have to be meek, timid, and submissive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId221211&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(4) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D deficiency:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D has a major impact on overall health, including the health of hair and hair follicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId275956&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Vitamin D production is hindered when the skin is covered, such as with a Hijab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate vitamin D, direct sun rays on bare skin are necessary. Consequently, wearing any cloth, like a Hijab, or being behind a glass window prevents the body from producing vitamin D. This leads to a significant deficiency in Arab women, with scientific studies indicating they suffer from the highest rates of vitamin D deficiency globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence supporting the connection between the Hijab and vitamin D deficiency, some Muslim individuals deny its role and offer alternative explanations like obesity, race, or specific health conditions as potential causes. However, a conclusive scientific study conducted in Istanbul, Turkey, addressed these concerns. The study examined women of the same race and region, half of whom wore the Hijab and half who did not. The results unequivocally revealed that women with Hijab exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (55.0%) compared to those without Hijab (20.0%), effectively dispelling any misinformation surrounding the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25156789/&quot;&gt;Link to Istanbul Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId401392&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By forcing baby girls into Hijab, you are causing them harm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId247010&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211202043904if_/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ctzs6f8rUAk/maxresdefault.jpg&quot; width=&quot;583&quot; height=&quot;329&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istanbul study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25156789/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) revealed that vitamin D deficiency is not solely related to clothing styles like Hijab but is also influenced by the age at which a female starts wearing Muslim-style clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dress your baby girl in Hijab at an early age, she becomes particularly vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency. As a Muslim mother (or father) of a baby girl, it is essential to stand up against pressure from your family and Islamic society. Don't allow them to push you into confining your baby girl into Hijab. Instead, let her play freely, promoting her health and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId460701&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Vitamin D supplements are not as effective as natural sun-rays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Muslims come up with their next lame excuse, i.e. no problem with the Hijab as women/girls can take vitamin D supplements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scientific studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352939316300379&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) demonstrate that sunlight exposure has a more positive impact on bone structure and homeostasis compared to vitamin D supplementation and control. The group with vitamin D deficiency that was exposed to sunlight exhibited a significant reduction in parathyroid hormone levels compared to the group that took vitamin D supplements versus VDD controls (67.69 ± 13.18 and 78.93 ± 8.31 vs. 86.05 ± 9.67 pg/ml, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId159284&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Allah is still guilty of vitamin D deficiency in the women of the last 1400 years and those poor women who cannot afford to buy supplements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Muslim argument of &quot;Vitamin D supplements&quot; does not absolve Allah of potential guilt. While supplements have become available only recently due to Western inventions, what about the millions of Muslim women throughout history who suffered from vitamin D deficiency and its associated diseases due to the Hijab? They were confined to both the Hijab and the confines of their homes by Allah's decree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many Muslim women today still cannot afford vitamin D supplements, which highlights the ongoing issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the vitamin D deficiency issue challenges the concept of an all-knowing and all-wise Allah reigning in the heavens. Given that Muhammad was neither all-knowing nor all-wise, his ignorance might have led to the widespread vitamin D deficiency among billions of Muslim women over the past 14 centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really breaks my heart that a lot of Muslim women tend to have weaker bones, dental issues and depression thanks to staying indoors a lot. Even if they went outside, the sun doesn't kiss their skin. Even plants and animals can sunbathe, but like vampires, Muslim women are the only creatures on the planet that don't have a right to the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amount of Islamic Indoctrination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion makes people blind. And you cannot show the right path to blind people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) 100% Naural Silk Cap, Silk Pillow &amp;amp; Microfiber Towel:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try looking for some 100% silk-lined undercaps, which are silk on the inside and cotton on the outside so the hijab doesn't slip (&lt;a href=&quot;https://modestbehaviour.com/product/inner-silk-underscarf/&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;). There are cheaper satin ones, but if you can afford it, then go for 100% natural silk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also use silk (or satin) pillow covers. They are much better than cotton ones to protect your hair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please also use only microfiber towel to dry your hair (and not the cotton towels).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(2) 100% Natural Soap Bar&lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=aleppo+soap+bar&amp;amp;crid=2GDNJPZWTB7QF&amp;amp;sprefix=aleppo+soap+bar%2Caps%2C154&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try using &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=aleppo+soap+bar&amp;amp;crid=2GDNJPZWTB7QF&amp;amp;sprefix=aleppo+soap+bar%2Caps%2C154&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Aleppo soap bars (80% Olive oil, 20% Laurel oil)&lt;/a&gt;. There is nothing in the market which can be more natural than this.Aleppo Soap is Highly Natural and Gentle on the Scalp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Aleppo soap, traditionally made with &lt;strong&gt;80% olive oil and 20% laurel oil&lt;/strong&gt;, is one of the most natural soaps available. Unlike commercial shampoos and conditioners that often contain synthetic ingredients, Aleppo soap relies solely on plant-based oils. This makes it free from harsh chemicals, additives, or artificial fragrances that can irritate the scalp or weaken hair roots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balances Scalp Oil:&lt;/strong&gt; Olive oil is rich in vitamins A and E and is known for its moisturizing properties. It nourishes the scalp without stripping away natural oils, which helps balance scalp oil production. This balance can reduce excess dryness or oiliness, both of which can contribute to hair loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mild Cleansing:&lt;/strong&gt; Aleppo soap provides a mild yet effective cleanse that doesn’t over-strip the hair. This helps retain natural moisture, preventing the scalp from drying out and protecting hair from breaking or thinning due to excessive dryness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-fungal and Anti-bacterial:&lt;/strong&gt; Laurel oil has natural anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties, making it beneficial for those dealing with scalp infections or dandruff, which can interfere with hair growth. A healthy, clean scalp provides a stronger foundation for hair to grow. It helps in thicker hair growth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(3) 100% Natural Conditioners:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aloe Vera Gel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Helps:&lt;/strong&gt; Aloe vera moisturizes, soothes the scalp, and leaves hair feeling soft and smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Apply pure aloe vera gel directly to damp hair. Leave it on for 10-15 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coconut Milk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Helps:&lt;/strong&gt; Coconut milk is rich in vitamins and fatty acids that nourish the scalp, strengthen hair, and add moisture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Pour a small amount of coconut milk onto your hair, focusing on the ends. Leave it on for 5-10 minutes before rinsing thoroughly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honey and Water Mixture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Helps:&lt;/strong&gt; Honey is a humectant, meaning it draws moisture into the hair, leaving it soft and hydrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Mix a tablespoon of honey with a cup of warm water. Pour over your hair after washing, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then rinse well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(4) Dry your hairs before putting on a Hijab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem obvious but always make sure your hair’s totally dry before you put on a hijab (leaving damp hair covered for long periods could lead to a fungal infection).&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to respect for religion, the harms of the Hijab have not been discussed for the last 1400 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to modern information technology, Hijabi women have been able to discuss their experiences on the internet and discover the potential negative consequences of wearing a Hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hijab is UNNATURAL, and indeed Islam is absolutely not a religion of nature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId275956&quot;&gt;Vitamin D is not produced under any cloth (like Hijab)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId401392&quot;&gt;You are hurting your baby girls by confining them into Hijab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId460701&quot;&gt;Vitamin D supplements are not as good as natural sun-rays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId159284&quot;&gt;Allah is still guilty of vitamin D deficiency in the women of the last 1400 years and those poor women who cannot afford to buy supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId694558&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) Sweating, Fungi, Bacteria, Sticky hair, Bad Odour, Scratching, Dandruff, Candida:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tight under-cap creates a hot, humid (sweat!) atmosphere which is a paradise for fungi and bacteria which is the death of hair follicles. Tons of hijabis suffer from seborrheic dermatitis or folliculitis and you can treat it as much as you want, when you give the culprits the perfect biotope to spread and multiply you will not get rid of it! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Lq5qzZxLrLgJ:repository.uhamka.ac.id/3427/1/artikel%2520ice%2520stem%2520Dan%2520Loa%2520Husnin%2520Nahry%2520Yarza.pdf&amp;amp;cd=11&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=de&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On hot summer days, women who wear hijabs often experience a sticky feeling, followed by a bad odour. And this ordeal becomes exponentially high the longer one stays out of the home (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210804000239/https://www.marham.pk/healthblog/hey-you-hijabis-heres-how-you-can-keep-your-hair-fresh-in-summers/#:%7E:text=Often%2C%20women%20put%20their%20hijab,a%20swarming%20invasion%20by%20lice.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you realise it or not, your head constantly sweats under your hijab. It leads to becoming warmer and warmer which is the perfect environment for germs and bacteria. Consequently, you keep scratching your head every now and then (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210804000239/https://www.marham.pk/healthblog/hey-you-hijabis-heres-how-you-can-keep-your-hair-fresh-in-summers/#:%7E:text=Often%2C%20women%20put%20their%20hijab,a%20swarming%20invasion%20by%20lice.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human hair is also known as a storehouse for Staphylococcus aureus. From WHO data, this problem is one of the serious problems of concern. From several facts, it was found that they are seriously harmful to human health. Besides that, one other type of fungus that is often in the hair is Candida. The repetitive use of the Hijab can leave microorganisms and bacteria so that it can cause unwanted things and problems with hair, face, dandruff and other serious problems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409043114/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Lq5qzZxLrLgJ:repository.uhamka.ac.id/3427/1/artikel%2520ice%2520stem%2520Dan%2520Loa%2520Husnin%2520Nahry%2520Yarza.pdf&amp;amp;cd=11&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=de&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study in Indonesia showed that a very high number of women (i.e. 59.4%), who were wearing hijab, complained of hair problems, scalp, itching and allergies on the scalp and areas around the face (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409043114/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Lq5qzZxLrLgJ:repository.uhamka.ac.id/3427/1/artikel%2520ice%2520stem%2520Dan%2520Loa%2520Husnin%2520Nahry%2520Yarza.pdf&amp;amp;cd=11&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=de&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId67194&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2)  Hair loss, Baldness, Receding Hairline, Thinning of Hairs due to Hijab alopecia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Do you know what &lt;strong&gt;hijab alopecia&lt;/strong&gt; is? Also known by the scientific term, traction alopecia, it’s caused by the intense friction from the hijab. The hairstyle underneath, combined with how the fabric is placed and rubs against your scalp every day over very prolonged periods, can traumatise your hair and damage the follicle, resulting in hair loss! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409084455/https://www.havehalalwilltravel.com/beijing-101-hijab-alopecia-hair-care&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Out of the 67% of respondents who wear hijabs, a whopping 79% said they faced hair loss! &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409084455/https://www.havehalalwilltravel.com/beijing-101-hijab-alopecia-hair-care&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Many Hijabi women report having issues like &lt;strong&gt;forehead acne&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;thinning hair&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://edit.sundayriley.com/your-hijab-might-be-causing-you-to-lose-hair-heres-what-the-experts-have-to-say/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receding Hairline: &lt;/strong&gt;There are many reasons for a receding hairline. “One is traction alopecia which is what occurs when there is chronic friction or tension placed on hair roots for an extended period of time. If the hijab is pulling at the hair roots for years, this can result in the hair roots experiencing too much tension and dying,” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://edit.sundayriley.com/your-hijab-might-be-causing-you-to-lose-hair-heres-what-the-experts-have-to-say/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many girls and young women who, combined with hormonal issues, ended up with such horrible hairlines (even actual baldness) that they decided to wear hijab for aesthetic (not religious) purposes (i.e. they want to hide their forehead acne, thinning of hair, sticky hair etc. even from other women). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black women and women with curly hair face the most difficult situation. A  Hijabi girl wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hated wearing hijab, I have naturallly curly dry hair so wearing the hijab always made my scalp so itchy and I got scalp fungal infections, dandruff and flakes. Even with treatments it'd improve a little then become worse again because I was always wearing the hijab, it was obviously much worse in the summer. My parents forced me to wear it from the age of 7 years old and was never allowed to take it off unless I was just with my family. I hated doing sports whilst wearing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;A Black woman was interviewed to inform the audience about the life of wearing hijab, and she was asked this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;“ What do you wish more people knew about being a hijabi?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;She responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;That we are balding for the sake of Allah. Imma need my edges back in [heaven] for real, for real.” (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/amatullahshaw/black-hijabi-haircare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.buzzfeed.com/amatullahshaw/black-hijabi-haircare#&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The fact that this poor girl, who suffered from these ailments as a result of the hijab, wished for Allah to give her hair back in heaven is so sad. It is so sad that they actually think such an entity, if it really exists, would actually do such a thing and not just burn them alive in hell for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId805540&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Stiffness and Pain in Neck and Head  Caused by Hijab, and relief from it after removing it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was done in Islamic Pakistan (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230409170346/https://www.rmj.org.pk/fulltext/27-1533115724.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; To identify the frequency of neck pain associated with modern hijab in females of twin cities of Pakistan along with identification of risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt; A total of 747 females participated from 4 different Universities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad (Pakistan) were included in the study. The study duration was 6 months from January to June 2017. Northwick questionnaire for neck pain was used to assess the neck pain intensity, symptoms, numbness, impact on daily activities and social life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of 747 participants, 393(50.2%) females were covering their head with modern hijab. Type of head cover daily duration of hijab were significantly associated with stiffness or discomfort in neck, restriction with movement, pain and stiffness in head and neck region and relief from pain after removal of hijab (p&amp;lt;0.05). Intensity of pain, sleeping and pain, symptoms duration, carrying and reading or watching TV did not show any significant relationship with the type of head cover (p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ex-Hijabi wrote about migraine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I would also like to add, as someone who wore Hijab from age 6 to 19, the tight undercap was a definitive trigger for migraines. Me and my mom are prone to migraines, and Hijab always makes it really bad, especially if I'm outside for hours, having to move around a lot. The pressure squeezing my head constantly is a recipe for a migraine that lasts for hours. I had frequent migraines in college when I was in college. My migraines decreased significantly in frequency and intensity when I took off Hijab, esp that feeling of suffocation and the psychological effect of feeling like u have to be meek, timid, and submissive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId221211&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(4) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D deficiency:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D has a major impact on overall health, including the health of hair and hair follicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId275956&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Vitamin D production is hindered when the skin is covered, such as with a Hijab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate vitamin D, direct sun rays on bare skin are necessary. Consequently, wearing any cloth, like a Hijab, or being behind a glass window prevents the body from producing vitamin D. This leads to a significant deficiency in Arab women, with scientific studies indicating they suffer from the highest rates of vitamin D deficiency globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence supporting the connection between the Hijab and vitamin D deficiency, some Muslim individuals deny its role and offer alternative explanations like obesity, race, or specific health conditions as potential causes. However, a conclusive scientific study conducted in Istanbul, Turkey, addressed these concerns. The study examined women of the same race and region, half of whom wore the Hijab and half who did not. The results unequivocally revealed that women with Hijab exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (55.0%) compared to those without Hijab (20.0%), effectively dispelling any misinformation surrounding the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25156789/&quot;&gt;Link to Istanbul Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId401392&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By forcing baby girls into Hijab, you are causing them harm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId247010&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211202043904if_/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ctzs6f8rUAk/maxresdefault.jpg&quot; width=&quot;583&quot; height=&quot;329&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istanbul study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25156789/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) revealed that vitamin D deficiency is not solely related to clothing styles like Hijab but is also influenced by the age at which a female starts wearing Muslim-style clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dress your baby girl in Hijab at an early age, she becomes particularly vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency. As a Muslim mother (or father) of a baby girl, it is essential to stand up against pressure from your family and Islamic society. Don't allow them to push you into confining your baby girl into Hijab. Instead, let her play freely, promoting her health and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId460701&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Vitamin D supplements are not as effective as natural sun-rays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Muslims come up with their next lame excuse, i.e. no problem with the Hijab as women/girls can take vitamin D supplements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scientific studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352939316300379&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) demonstrate that sunlight exposure has a more positive impact on bone structure and homeostasis compared to vitamin D supplementation and control. The group with vitamin D deficiency that was exposed to sunlight exhibited a significant reduction in parathyroid hormone levels compared to the group that took vitamin D supplements versus VDD controls (67.69 ± 13.18 and 78.93 ± 8.31 vs. 86.05 ± 9.67 pg/ml, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId159284&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Allah is still guilty of vitamin D deficiency in the women of the last 1400 years and those poor women who cannot afford to buy supplements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Muslim argument of &quot;Vitamin D supplements&quot; does not absolve Allah of potential guilt. While supplements have become available only recently due to Western inventions, what about the millions of Muslim women throughout history who suffered from vitamin D deficiency and its associated diseases due to the Hijab? They were confined to both the Hijab and the confines of their homes by Allah's decree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many Muslim women today still cannot afford vitamin D supplements, which highlights the ongoing issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the vitamin D deficiency issue challenges the concept of an all-knowing and all-wise Allah reigning in the heavens. Given that Muhammad was neither all-knowing nor all-wise, his ignorance might have led to the widespread vitamin D deficiency among billions of Muslim women over the past 14 centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really breaks my heart that a lot of Muslim women tend to have weaker bones, dental issues and depression thanks to staying indoors a lot. Even if they went outside, the sun doesn't kiss their skin. Even plants and animals can sunbathe, but like vampires, Muslim women are the only creatures on the planet that don't have a right to the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amount of Islamic Indoctrination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion makes people blind. And you cannot show the right path to blind people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) 100% Naural Silk Cap, Silk Pillow &amp;amp; Microfiber Towel:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try looking for some 100% silk-lined undercaps, which are silk on the inside and cotton on the outside so the hijab doesn't slip (&lt;a href=&quot;https://modestbehaviour.com/product/inner-silk-underscarf/&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;). There are cheaper satin ones, but if you can afford it, then go for 100% natural silk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also use silk (or satin) pillow covers. They are much better than cotton ones to protect your hair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please also use only microfiber towel to dry your hair (and not the cotton towels).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(2) 100% Natural Soap Bar&lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=aleppo+soap+bar&amp;amp;crid=2GDNJPZWTB7QF&amp;amp;sprefix=aleppo+soap+bar%2Caps%2C154&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try using &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=aleppo+soap+bar&amp;amp;crid=2GDNJPZWTB7QF&amp;amp;sprefix=aleppo+soap+bar%2Caps%2C154&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Aleppo soap bars (80% Olive oil, 20% Laurel oil)&lt;/a&gt;. There is nothing in the market which can be more natural than this.Aleppo Soap is Highly Natural and Gentle on the Scalp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Aleppo soap, traditionally made with &lt;strong&gt;80% olive oil and 20% laurel oil&lt;/strong&gt;, is one of the most natural soaps available. Unlike commercial shampoos and conditioners that often contain synthetic ingredients, Aleppo soap relies solely on plant-based oils. This makes it free from harsh chemicals, additives, or artificial fragrances that can irritate the scalp or weaken hair roots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balances Scalp Oil:&lt;/strong&gt; Olive oil is rich in vitamins A and E and is known for its moisturizing properties. It nourishes the scalp without stripping away natural oils, which helps balance scalp oil production. This balance can reduce excess dryness or oiliness, both of which can contribute to hair loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mild Cleansing:&lt;/strong&gt; Aleppo soap provides a mild yet effective cleanse that doesn’t over-strip the hair. This helps retain natural moisture, preventing the scalp from drying out and protecting hair from breaking or thinning due to excessive dryness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-fungal and Anti-bacterial:&lt;/strong&gt; Laurel oil has natural anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties, making it beneficial for those dealing with scalp infections or dandruff, which can interfere with hair growth. A healthy, clean scalp provides a stronger foundation for hair to grow. It helps in thicker hair growth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(3) 100% Natural Conditioners:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aloe Vera Gel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Helps:&lt;/strong&gt; Aloe vera moisturizes, soothes the scalp, and leaves hair feeling soft and smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Apply pure aloe vera gel directly to damp hair. Leave it on for 10-15 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coconut Milk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Helps:&lt;/strong&gt; Coconut milk is rich in vitamins and fatty acids that nourish the scalp, strengthen hair, and add moisture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Pour a small amount of coconut milk onto your hair, focusing on the ends. Leave it on for 5-10 minutes before rinsing thoroughly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honey and Water Mixture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Helps:&lt;/strong&gt; Honey is a humectant, meaning it draws moisture into the hair, leaving it soft and hydrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Mix a tablespoon of honey with a cup of warm water. Pour over your hair after washing, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then rinse well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(4) Dry your hairs before putting on a Hijab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem obvious but always make sure your hair’s totally dry before you put on a hijab (leaving damp hair covered for long periods could lead to a fungal infection).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lack of interaction between men and women leads to thousands of misunderstandings in society, some of which can have severe consequences. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;One such incident is IFK, where a misunderstanding arose due to Islamic Hijab and Modesty:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This misunderstanding escalated to a deadly level, causing a division among the Sahaba (companions) of Muhammad into two groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The situation became so tense that these two groups were on the verge of fighting and killing each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, Muhammad himself contemplated divorcing 'Aisha, despite her being fully innocent, due to the impact of this misunderstanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some members of society became mentally ill and baselessly slandered innocent 'Aisha, resulting in severe punishment later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This entire dramatic situation persisted for a whole month and finally came to an end only through divine revelation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without the claim of revelation by Muhammad, the consequences of these misunderstandings in this incident could have been even deadlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Aisha told how the misunderstanding in the incident of Ifk began:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Narrated `Aisha: ... &lt;b&gt;I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt)&lt;/b&gt;. So we went on till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. &lt;b&gt;(In the meanwhile) the people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it&lt;/b&gt;...They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident reflects some unique problems that are unnecessarily created due to the Hijab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Islamic concept of hijab enforces a complete separation between women and men in society. Any form of conversation or interaction between men and women is deemed inappropriate and against 'Islamic Modesty'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the journey, 'Aisha had to conceal herself behind the curtains of her camel's howdah, ensuring she remained hidden from the sight of men. The strict separation of genders prevented the men lifting her howdah from even greeting her, making it difficult for them to ascertain her presence inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of interaction is evident in the incident of Ifk when Safwan found 'Aisha. The cultural norms dictated that men and women should remain distanced, adding to the complexities of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref) &lt;br&gt;Narrated 'Aisha: ... While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me &lt;b&gt;as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed)&lt;/b&gt;. So I woke up when he recited Istirja' (i.e. &quot;Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un&quot;) as soon as he recognized me, &lt;b&gt;I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word&lt;/b&gt;, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, how can Islam claim to be a 'religion of nature' when it imposes such stringent restrictions that even in emergencies, men and women cannot exchange a single word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What harm would it have caused if Safwan had greeted 'Aisha and inquired about her situation? He could have offered assistance or asked if she needed any help in that particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the present day, Muslim women and girls struggle to seek help without hesitation from men, be it male doctors, teachers, or others. These unnatural restrictions consume significant societal energy and render half of the Islamic society (i.e., women) practically limited in their ability to contribute productively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dire Consequences of Misunderstanding that took place in Ifk due to Islamic Hijab and Modesty:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident of Ifk resulted in a situation where Muhammad was on the verge of divorcing 'Aisha, despite her being entirely innocent. Additionally, some members of society faced severe punishment due to their involvement, and the entire episode extended for a full month, only concluding when divine revelation intervened. (i.e. without the claim of revelation by Muhammad, the consequences of misunderstandings in this incident would have become even deadlier). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Hadith of Ifk conitnues)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt; (Urwa said, &quot;The people propagated the slander and talked about it in his (i.e. `Abdullah's) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to let it prevail.&quot; `Urwa also added, &quot;None was mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides (`Abdullah) except &lt;b&gt;Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge&lt;/b&gt;,...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Aisha added, &quot;After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers &lt;b&gt;while I was unaware of anything of all that,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and leave&lt;/b&gt;. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;('Aisha further said) When the Divine Inspiration was delayed, &lt;b&gt;Allah's Messenger called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Muhammad also asked Barira, the maid-servant) and Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' So, on that day, Allah's Messenger got up on the pulpit and complained about `Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, '&lt;b&gt;O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about my family?&lt;/b&gt; By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man (i.e. Safwan) about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger ! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and he was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah's Messenger was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger kept on quietening them till they became silent and so did he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further told that she went to her parents house and stayed there. And after one month) Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. &lt;b&gt;He had never sat with me since that day of the slander.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.&lt;/b&gt; Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-and so about you; &lt;b&gt;if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'&lt;/b&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;('Aisha further said) Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger .' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, &lt;b&gt;'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me.&lt;/b&gt; By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' &lt;b&gt;Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed;&lt;/b&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&amp;quot;dsr&amp;quot;:[22324,22708,0,0]}&quot;&gt;('Aisha further said after that immediately revelation started coming to Muhammad and he said to her) 'O `Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger). I replied, &lt;b&gt;'By Allah, I will not go to him,&lt;/b&gt; and I praise none but Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this incident were severe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a complete month, 'Aisha endured emotional distress and pain, despite her innocence. Even Muhammad harbored suspicion in his heart and showed no compassion towards her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident divided the Muslims into two factions, on the brink of violence against each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these 'restrictions' imposed in the name of 'Islamic Modesty' are contrary to human nature, leading to a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;paranoid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skeptical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; society that verges on becoming a psychological case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons behind the slander against 'Aisha by the two companions, Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah, remain unclear. However, it appears that these unnatural restrictions are fostering &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;paranoia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and transforming members of the Islamic society into individuals believing in unfounded notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, thousands of killings occur in Islamic societies in the name of 'Honour Killing', solely based on doubts and paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire one-month-long drama stemmed from the restrictions on the interaction between men and women in the guise of 'Islamic Modesty'. Unfortunately, these same restrictions continue to plague Islamic society even today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Taliban didn't even let other women helpers come to that area to help injured women. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hijab as ‘choice’: When 15 girls were left to die in a raging fire just because they were not ‘appropriately dressed’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the incident, there were around 800 students and 50 teachers in the school. The building was an over-crowded rented property. During the investigation into the fire, the agencies found there were iron bars on the windows, making them impossible for anyone to use for escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 11, 2002, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/1660041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;15 young girls were left to die&lt;/a&gt; in a fire at their school in Mecca. They could have escaped the fire but were not allowed to flee the burning building as they were not wearing proper ‘Islamic’ clothes. Saudi Arabia’s Religious Police prevented the Civil Defense Officers from entering the school to save the girls and stopped the girls from coming out of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/03/19/they-died-for-lack-of-a-head-scarf/86cbcc5a-6cef-49e5-b758-167527e6eed0/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Islamic concept of hijab enforces a complete separation between women and men in society. Any form of conversation or interaction between men and women is deemed inappropriate and against 'Islamic Modesty'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the journey, 'Aisha had to conceal herself behind the curtains of her camel's howdah, ensuring she remained hidden from the sight of men. The strict separation of genders prevented the men lifting her howdah from even greeting her, making it difficult for them to ascertain her presence inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of interaction is evident in the incident of Ifk when Safwan found 'Aisha. The cultural norms dictated that men and women should remain distanced, adding to the complexities of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref) &lt;br&gt;Narrated 'Aisha: ... While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me &lt;b&gt;as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed)&lt;/b&gt;. So I woke up when he recited Istirja' (i.e. &quot;Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un&quot;) as soon as he recognized me, &lt;b&gt;I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word&lt;/b&gt;, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, how can Islam claim to be a 'religion of nature' when it imposes such stringent restrictions that even in emergencies, men and women cannot exchange a single word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What harm would it have caused if Safwan had greeted 'Aisha and inquired about her situation? He could have offered assistance or asked if she needed any help in that particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the present day, Muslim women and girls struggle to seek help without hesitation from men, be it male doctors, teachers, or others. These unnatural restrictions consume significant societal energy and render half of the Islamic society (i.e., women) practically limited in their ability to contribute productively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dire Consequences of Misunderstanding that took place in Ifk due to Islamic Hijab and Modesty:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident of Ifk resulted in a situation where Muhammad was on the verge of divorcing 'Aisha, despite her being entirely innocent. Additionally, some members of society faced severe punishment due to their involvement, and the entire episode extended for a full month, only concluding when divine revelation intervened. (i.e. without the claim of revelation by Muhammad, the consequences of misunderstandings in this incident would have become even deadlier). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Hadith of Ifk conitnues)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt; (Urwa said, &quot;The people propagated the slander and talked about it in his (i.e. `Abdullah's) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to let it prevail.&quot; `Urwa also added, &quot;None was mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides (`Abdullah) except &lt;b&gt;Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge&lt;/b&gt;,...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Aisha added, &quot;After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers &lt;b&gt;while I was unaware of anything of all that,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and leave&lt;/b&gt;. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;('Aisha further said) When the Divine Inspiration was delayed, &lt;b&gt;Allah's Messenger called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Muhammad also asked Barira, the maid-servant) and Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' So, on that day, Allah's Messenger got up on the pulpit and complained about `Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, '&lt;b&gt;O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about my family?&lt;/b&gt; By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man (i.e. Safwan) about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger ! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and he was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah's Messenger was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger kept on quietening them till they became silent and so did he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further told that she went to her parents house and stayed there. And after one month) Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. &lt;b&gt;He had never sat with me since that day of the slander.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.&lt;/b&gt; Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-and so about you; &lt;b&gt;if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'&lt;/b&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;('Aisha further said) Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger .' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, &lt;b&gt;'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me.&lt;/b&gt; By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' &lt;b&gt;Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed;&lt;/b&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-parsoid=&quot;{&amp;quot;dsr&amp;quot;:[22324,22708,0,0]}&quot;&gt;('Aisha further said after that immediately revelation started coming to Muhammad and he said to her) 'O `Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger). I replied, &lt;b&gt;'By Allah, I will not go to him,&lt;/b&gt; and I praise none but Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this incident were severe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a complete month, 'Aisha endured emotional distress and pain, despite her innocence. Even Muhammad harbored suspicion in his heart and showed no compassion towards her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident divided the Muslims into two factions, on the brink of violence against each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these 'restrictions' imposed in the name of 'Islamic Modesty' are contrary to human nature, leading to a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;paranoid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;skeptical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; society that verges on becoming a psychological case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons behind the slander against 'Aisha by the two companions, Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah, remain unclear. However, it appears that these unnatural restrictions are fostering &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;paranoia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and transforming members of the Islamic society into individuals believing in unfounded notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, thousands of killings occur in Islamic societies in the name of 'Honour Killing', solely based on doubts and paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire one-month-long drama stemmed from the restrictions on the interaction between men and women in the guise of 'Islamic Modesty'. Unfortunately, these same restrictions continue to plague Islamic society even today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taliban didn't let men help the injured Women during the  Earthquake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/urdu/articles/ce7jwe8w3ewo?fbclid=IwAR1yFKhIUbyZ-sfXZ69o6RgU_ho0qORDLyPmeN9pR8mxYqPGNSmpH0GvQiA&quot;&gt;BBC News:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taliban didn't let men help the injured women during the earthquake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And there were almost no lady doctors present in hospitals due to the Taliban's ban on women from getting higher education and working. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Taliban didn't even let other women helpers come to that area to help injured women. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Woman drowns in Dubai after father blocks rescue to save her from ‘dishonour’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A father let his 20-year-old daughter drown off a beach in Dubai by preventing lifeguards from rescuing her because he did not want her to be touched by a strange man, Emirati news media reported Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hijab as ‘choice’: When 15 girls were left to die in a raging fire just because they were not ‘appropriately dressed’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the incident, there were around 800 students and 50 teachers in the school. The building was an over-crowded rented property. During the investigation into the fire, the agencies found there were iron bars on the windows, making them impossible for anyone to use for escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 11, 2002, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/1660041&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;15 young girls were left to die&lt;/a&gt; in a fire at their school in Mecca. They could have escaped the fire but were not allowed to flee the burning building as they were not wearing proper ‘Islamic’ clothes. Saudi Arabia’s Religious Police prevented the Civil Defense Officers from entering the school to save the girls and stopped the girls from coming out of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/03/19/they-died-for-lack-of-a-head-scarf/86cbcc5a-6cef-49e5-b758-167527e6eed0/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Suicide 'everywhere' among Afghan women, UN official tells Security Council&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;United Nations: Suicide and suicidal ideation are &quot;everywhere&quot; for Afghan women as they become increasingly isolated and restricted, often by male relatives tasked with upholding the Taliban's decrees, the UN's women chief told the Security Council Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;As the percentage of women employed continues to drop, &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;90 per cent of young women respondents report bad or very bad mental health, and suicide and suicidal ideation is everywhere&lt;/strong&gt; ... They tell us that their elimination from public life is like a continuous fear of violent death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId635954&quot;&gt;(2) Daniel's argument: Spread of AIDS due to TEMPORARY Sexual Relationships in the non-Muslims countries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId399691&quot;&gt;(5) Depression is all-time high in Islamic countries like Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId918743&quot;&gt;(8) If Muslim States don't let women go outside without Hijab, then the Western countries also don't let you go naked outside in public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId323910&quot;&gt;(10) Naturism in western countries is totally different from the Islamic forced nakedness of slave women and their rape:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/#mozTocId354264&quot;&gt;(11) The case of Hijab in the Islamic countries is totally Opposite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId841057&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(1) Daniel claims that the evolution of human societies is linked to the practice where they imposed hijab on women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;No. The evolution of human societies is not linked to this practice of hijab. There are thousands of tribes, which even exist today, where women and men are totally naked or women are topless. There are tons of videos on YouTube about them. For example, look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newatlantisline&quot;&gt;Youtube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel is making a mistake, whereas there were only a handful of societies that imposed hijab on women historically, and they did it only to differentiate between free women of noble families and slave women/prostitutes. They prohibited slave women and prostitutes from wearing hijab and from resembling free women from noble families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elite women in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Byzantine, Greek, and Persian empires wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_80-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-80&quot;&gt;[79]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria had explicit &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sumptuary laws&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_laws&quot;&gt;sumptuary laws&lt;/a&gt; detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_80-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-80&quot;&gt;[79]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-El_Guindi_2-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-El_Guindi-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad only followed those few societies in this discrimination; he banned slave women from wearing hijab. Umar ibn Al-Khattab used to beat slave women with a stick if they wore hijab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by wearing hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's companions used to molest women who went out to relieve themselves in the evening for nature's call. Upon that, Muhammad ordered free Muslim women, in the name of revelation, to wear hijab so that they could be recognized as free women and not molested as slave women were molested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad also kept the breasts of slave women naked in public. Yes, there were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. They were sold in that same naked state in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, as Islam prohibited Slave Women from taking a Hijab or even covering their naked breasts in public 🔥ʰᵒᵗ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId635954&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(2) Daniel claims that AIDS is spreading due to TEMPORARY Sexual Relationships in non-Muslim countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But Islam also allowed &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEMPORARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sexual Relationships with dozens of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Islam, a man is allowed to buy a slave woman (or capture a prisoner woman) and rape her legally. And when he fulfils his lust, then she can be handed over to his brother, or male slave. And when all brothers and slaves have raped her one by one in a &lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship, then she can be sold to 2nd master, who again rapes her and sells her to the 3rd master .... and thus the rape of poor slave woman continued in such a &lt;strong&gt;TEMPORARY&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details in our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the original Islamic Sharia could not have saved Muslims from HIV due to temporary sexual relationships with dozens of slave women. Muslims have been saved from HIV only when the Western world compelled them to abolish Slavery, which is permitted (Halal) in Sharia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, instead of criminalizing natural behaviors between consenting adults and forbidding people from engaging in them, the solution to preventing illness transmission through sexual activity lies in finding treatments for such diseases and implementing measures to stop their propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIDS research has advanced considerably, leading to fewer HIV-related fatalities than those caused by conditions such as diabetes&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Health/uk-doctor-id-hiv-diabetes/story?id=23349162&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR2pDq3PiGgquKqzomP-5RoAgokJh_cl0fgQ5UPSR7-0HSeoRt7g4sTQxO8&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel's claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_guarding_in_humans&quot;&gt;Mate-Guarding&lt;/a&gt; is a part of human evolution and even of apes is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Bonobo apes, unlike other apes, do not practice mate-guarding. This behavior is influenced by their environment, where food is abundant and competition for mates is not as intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even among chimpanzees, females engage in relations with multiple males despite the concept of mate-guarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In human societies, there have been and still are several cultures where a woman can have multiple husbands, as seen in this link (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry#:%7E:text=Polyandry%20has%20been%20practised%20in,only%20among%20higher%20caste%20women.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, look at the Inuit culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/inuit-social-organization%3E&quot;&gt;The Canadian Encyclopedia: &quot;Inuit: Social Organization&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - This article states, &quot;When a man left his home for an extended period, a neighbor or friend took care of his family, including his wife. Children born from such arrangements were considered equal members of the household.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uaf.edu/anthropology/faculty/dietz/inuit_culture_and_society/%3E&quot;&gt;The University of Alaska Fairbanks' &quot;Inuit Culture and Society&quot; page&lt;/a&gt; - This resource notes, &quot;Inuit families were often fluid and flexible, with children being raised by multiple caregivers. When a man had to leave his home for an extended period, a neighbor or friend would take care of his family, including his wife. Children born from these arrangements were considered full members of the household.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples show that mate-guarding is not a universal behavior among animals or humans, and various cultural practices and environmental factors influence mating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, in Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Swapping of slave women is also allowed (i.e. two masters can swap their slave girls, and rape them without their consent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;A Muslim master can take the slave-wife of his male slave from him, and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, he can return her to his male slave. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;And if a slave woman is shared between multiple masters, and they do sex with her one by one, then the child will have officially multiple fathers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And it is the right of the owner either to accept the child from his slave women as his own or to deny the child his name. In this case, that child will be called a Bastard (Islamic Terminology is &quot;Walad al-Haram ولد الحرام&quot;), and the child becomes the slave of his own father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read this detailed article for swapping, shared slave women and parentage of a child from a slave woman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery Against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam has no problem with men having sex with 4 wives and dozens of slave girls (which he can rotate by selling older slave girls and buying new slave girls). Thus, Islam denies any mate-guarding in the case of men. It allows men to enjoy their lives. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Islam didn't allow Muslim men to buy and rape new slave girls out of any &lt;strong&gt;NECESSITY&lt;/strong&gt;, but it allowed them in order to fulfil their &lt;strong&gt;LUST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;What about the poor male slave who could not mate guard his wife, and the owner took his wife away from him and raped her? What kind of Islamic Mate Guauding is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And in mate guarding, the males didn't hand over their females to other males after &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; sexual relationships. But Islam allows the owner to have a &quot;temporary&quot; sexual relationship with his slave girl, and after fulfilling his lust, he can hand her over to his brother or slave, or sell her to another master. Therefore, this trait of Islam is not even counted as mate guarding, but Islam is only guarding men and their lust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Islam only comes into play when it needs to place restrictions on women in the name of mate guarding. The sole excuse is that women should not be allowed to enjoy their lives while there is an issue of determining the paternity of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the issue of paternity can be easily resolved with modern medical tests and DNA. Yet, Muslims still refuse to allow women to enjoy their lives and instead force them to wait for their husbands (even if they are preoccupied with other wives or slave girls, or if they are weak in sex and cannot satisfy them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older women or those who are already pregnant have no chance of becoming pregnant again. Nevertheless, Islam denies them any opportunity to enjoy their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be acceptable if both partners agreed to be exclusive in their marriage or partnership. However, Islam has become one-sided, permitting men to have multiple sexual partners while imposing restrictions solely on women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel's claim is based on the notion that only men bear financial responsibilities for children. Therefore, women should not have the authority to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the right to decide on abortion is not about a child, but about a fetus. The fetus has not yet been born, so there is no question of financial responsibility. Furthermore, only women have to endure the entire nine-month pregnancy, including the associated risks and discomforts. Consequently, the right to decide about abortion belongs exclusively to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Daniel's perspective overlooks the practices in Western countries. In these societies, when a woman earns income, she also shares the financial responsibility for the child, just like the father does. If the woman earns more than the father, her financial contribution may exceed his. Moreover, custody decisions are based on the best interests of the child, regardless of the gender of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, women have the same responsibilities concerning their children as fathers do. If a father takes care of the children, the mother is expected to provide financial support to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of pregnancy and delivery, only women have to endure the painful process, while husbands do not have a role in this biological aspect. Therefore, it is logical that women should have the right to make decisions regarding delivery or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, even if we were to accept that Islam places the burden of financial responsibility squarely on the shoulders of fathers, this would only serve to highlight the inherent flaws in the system. Under Islamic law, a father remains financially liable for his children and wife, even if he becomes impoverished or severely disabled and unable to work. On the other hand, a wealthy wife is not obligated to contribute financially to her husband's needs or those of her children. This glaring disparity raises questions about the fairness and balance of the Islamic system. Why, then, do Islamic apologists boast about such an unjust arrangement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Islamic system is further criticized for declaring the wife and children as the property of the man under the guise of the husband's financial responsibility. He can beat his wife, even with bruises&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=20&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;), but the poor wife cannot take divorce on the basis of this brutal beating&lt;/span&gt;. And he can also beat children, and if he kills them, still he will not be physically punished for that, as children are considered his property in Islam. Unbelievable. Please read our article: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=154&amp;amp;catid=35&quot;&gt;A child is the father's property in Islamic Sharia, thus the father cannot be physically punished for killing his child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, due to this unjust financial responsibility imposed solely on fathers, Islam seeks to deprive women of their right in making choices regarding delivery or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId399691&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(5) Depression is all-time high in Islamic countries like Pakistan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel's conclusion about Western people suffering more from depression than in Islamic countries is unsubstantiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of depression in Islamic countries, like Pakistan, is significant higher, as indicated in this research: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728784/#:~:text=Depression%20is%20a%20debilitating%20mood,at%2047%25%20%5B8%5D&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728784/#:~:text=Depression%20is%20a%20debilitating%20mood,at%2047%25%20%5B8%5D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the depression of women in Islamic countries is often underreported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, people experienced depression even with simple restrictions like wearing a mask. In contrast, Muslim women are required to wear the whole Hijab (and even Niqab). It is natural that the Hijab and Niqab are a source of extreme depression for a lot of Muslim women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Muslim women are discouraged from leaving their homes, and face discomfort when venturing outside. Their freedom of movement is limited, causing them to experience distressing situations when they are outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, also think about the depression that slave women had to suffer due to Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their masters could rape them against their consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their masters could hand them over to any of their brothers or male slaves to rape them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The master could break their family life, take the slave wife from his male slaves, and rape her. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The masters could separate the slave mothers from their children, and sell them (or their babies) in the Bazaars of Islamic slavery after the child had got 2 teeth (at 6 months approximately). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad allowed his followers to rape the captive minor and virgin girls the first night, although they had killed their fathers and brothers during the daytime. Just imagine the trauma those poor girls had to endure in that situation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There is an extensive list of documented crimes committed by Islam against humanity concerning the treatment of slave girls. For more in-depth information, please refer to our detailed article titled: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In addition to this, Daniel's claim regarding the higher suicide rate in Western countries as evidence of Western women being in depression is incorrect. Studies have shown that Western people tend to report higher levels of happiness compared to individuals in Islamic countries. However, in cases where individuals are suffering from severe illnesses and have lost interest in life, they may seek the right to Euthanasia (which some Muslims mistakenly label as suicide). Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=118&amp;amp;catid=17&quot;&gt;Suicide: Why the rate of suicide is higher in the Atheist Community?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId188243&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(6) Daniel claims that EQUAL human rights for women are the reason for the higher Divorce rate in Western countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel argues that equal human rights for women are behind the high divorce rates in Western nations. However, a closer examination of affluent Islamic countries like Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia tells a different story. Despite women lacking equal rights in these societies, the divorce rate exceeds 50%, surpassing that of numerous non-Muslim Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It appears that wealth alone can drive up the divorce rate, regardless of gender equality. When women become financially independent, they refuse to tolerate exploitation. Meanwhile, the Islamic system perpetuates the subjugation of women, treating them as mere slaves. Perhaps Muslims should follow through on this logic and enslave their women entirely; that way, they could achieve a zero divorce rate while Islam gives absolutely no human rights to slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=160&amp;amp;catid=17&quot;&gt;Muslims blame the non-religious Western system for Destroying the FAMILY System.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at Pakistan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Pakistan is at the top in the search for INCEST Porn in the world (for the last 2 decades).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;80% of child girls are raped by their fathers, brothers, cousins, uncles, and grandfathers. Their cases are not even registered in the police stations. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=10&amp;amp;catid=9&quot;&gt;Incest in Islamic Pakistan.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Pakistan is at the top in search of terms like &quot;donkey rape&quot; on Google. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thousands of children are being raped in Quran Schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Women are molested by mobs. This thing never happens in Western countries. It may be individual men indulge in abuses against women, but never a mob of men molest a woman. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim women are even molested during Hajj (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220114154056/https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/s3v9fb/sexual_assault_during_hajj/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While western women at disco parties and beaches are safer from molestation than Muslim women during Hajj gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read our articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId918743&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(8) Apologist Argument: If Muslim states enforce the Hijab for women, then Western countries also impose restrictions on public nudity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with Muslim preachers is their denial of the &quot;Evolution of Dress,&quot; which is a factual phenomenon. The evolution of dress began as a response to weather conditions, as our ancestors migrated to colder or hotter regions. They needed clothing for protection against extreme temperatures, while modern humans lost their body hair, leaving them vulnerable to the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the way people dressed became a symbol of status, with women from wealthy families covering themselves more, while women from poorer families or slaves often remained naked or partially clothed. This evolution eventually turned into a fashion trend. The lower class people, including slaves, often wore little to no clothing, and the upper class wore very luxurious clothing. Clothing norms evolved from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothing has an interesting history, but it wasn’t originally invented for “modesty” reasons. Actually, ancient people had no issue with clothing at all, and dress codes became established relatively recently on a human history timescale. It was these dress codes that led to the cultural aversion in some places of people being naked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question arises: Why do Muslim preachers solely use Western countries as their example? They should also consider indigenous tribes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newatlantisline&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) that have practised &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;Naturism&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. a lifestyle of practising non-sexual social &lt;a title=&quot;Nudity&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity&quot;&gt;nudity&lt;/a&gt; in private and in public) for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these tribes move naked in public without any dress, they still maintain a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;strong family system&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;These tribes don’t have rape and sexual assault as a big issue within them, and men and women see each other COMPLETELY NAKED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Compared to this, millions of Muslim women experience extreme molestation in Muslim countries despite wearing the Hijab. Even during the most religious Hajj gatherings, Muslim girls are exposed to extreme molestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1d00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read all details in this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western countries, too, have experienced a gradual evolution of dress. Influenced by the Christian religion for centuries, many Westerners still adhere to conservative dress codes. However, there is a growing movement of naturists in these countries, leading to the establishment of hundreds of nude beaches where nudity is completely normalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Denmark, nudism is permitted along 4,500 kilometres of coastline (where kids are also present along with families), and the same applies to other Scandinavian countries (source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/naturists-in-scandinavia/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/naturists-in-scandinavia/&lt;/a&gt;). While private offices and government institutions may have specific dress codes, in your personal life, you are even free to wear a bikini in public places. Despite the presence of bikinis in public or even total nudity on beaches, women in Western countries are not subjected to molestation and generally enjoy a safer environment compared to Muslim women, who unfortunately face instances of molestation even during Hajj gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, there is technically no law about nudity in Denmark. There is a relevant law, though, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;It is forbidden to display obscene or offensive behavior, that is likely to offend others or to outrage bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;Here’s the Danish text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;Det er forbudt at udvise uanstændig eller anstødelig opførsel, der er egnet til at forulempe andre eller vække offentlig forargelse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;The relevant word is “likely”. This makes the application of the law highly situational. Except for religious people in Denmark, other people will probably soon stop getting offended even if others move totally nude in public. It is just like indigenous tribes move naked and it is totally NORMAL for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Here is an introduction to the history of Nudity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;history of nudity&lt;/b&gt; involves social attitudes to nakedness of the human body in different cultures in history. The use of clothing to cover the body is one of the changes that mark the end of the Neolithic, and the beginning of civilizations. Nudity (or near-complete nudity) has traditionally been the social norm for both men and women in hunter-gatherer cultures in warm climates, and it is still common among many indigenous peoples. The need to cover the body is associated with human migration out of the tropics into climates where clothes were needed as protection from sun, heat, and dust in the Middle East; or from cold and rain in Europe and Asia. The first use of animal skins and cloth may have been as adornment, along with body modification, body painting, and jewelry, invented first for other purposes, such as magic, decoration, cult, or prestige. The skills used in their making were later found to be practical as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern societies, complete nudity in public became increasingly rare as nakedness became associated with lower status, but the mild Mediterranean climate allowed for a minimum of clothing, and in a number of ancient cultures, the athletic and/or cultist nudity of men and boys was a natural concept. In &lt;a title=&quot;Ancient Greece&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece&quot;&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;, nudity became associated with the perfection of the gods. In &lt;a title=&quot;Ancient Rome&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome&quot;&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;, complete nudity could be a public disgrace, though it could be seen at the public baths or in erotic art. In the Western world, with the spread of Christianity, any positive associations with nudity were replaced with concepts of sin and shame. Although rediscovery of Greek ideals in the Renaissance restored &lt;a title=&quot;Nude (art)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_%28art%29&quot;&gt;the nude&lt;/a&gt; to symbolic meaning in art, by the &lt;a title=&quot;Victorian era&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era&quot;&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt;, public nakedness was considered obscene. In Asia, public nudity has been viewed as a violation of social propriety rather than sin; embarrassing rather than shameful. However, in &lt;a title=&quot;Tokugawa shogunate&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, mixed-gender communal bathing was quite normal and commonplace until the &lt;a title=&quot;Meiji Restoration&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration&quot;&gt;Meiji Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the upper classes had turned clothing into &lt;a title=&quot;Fashion&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion&quot;&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;, those who could not afford otherwise continued to swim or bathe openly in natural bodies of water or frequent communal baths through the 19th century. Acceptance of public nudity re-emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosophically based movements, particularly in Germany, opposed the rise of industrialization. &lt;a title=&quot;Freikörperkultur&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freik%C3%B6rperkultur&quot;&gt;Freikörperkultur&lt;/a&gt; (Free Body Culture) represented a return to nature and the elimination of shame. In the 1960s &lt;a title=&quot;Naturism&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;naturism&lt;/a&gt; moved from being a small subculture to part of a general rejection of restrictions on the body. Women reasserted the right to uncover their breasts in public, which had been the norm until the 17th century. The trend continued in much of Europe, with the establishment of many clothing-optional areas in parks and on beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all of the historical changes in the &lt;a title=&quot;Developed country&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country&quot;&gt;developed countries&lt;/a&gt;, cultures in the tropical climates of &lt;a title=&quot;Sub-Saharan Africa&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa&quot;&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon rainforest&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest&quot;&gt;Amazon rainforest&lt;/a&gt; have continued with their traditional practices, being partially or completely nude during everyday activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId985135&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(9) Islam itself Practiced NUDITY (and the worst form of it while it was a FORCED Nudity)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic Preachers totally forget these realities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It was Islam who made slave women move in public topless. There were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad and in public with naked breasts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat them with a stick for taking Hijab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by taking the Hijab. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is 1300 year long history of Islam where slave women had to stay topless. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And Islam turned poor slave women into sexual objects too, and Muslim men were given licences to fulfil their sexual lusts by raping them. They were presented in that naked state in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery, where Muslim customers were also allowed to touch their private parts (just like sheep and cattle are groped before purchase). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And Muslim men were molesting slave women, without any fear of physical punishment, while Allah (i.e. Muhammad) didn't punish or even rebuked them for molesting slave women. Muslim men were raping slave girls in Temporary Sexual Relationships, and selling them, in order to buy new slave girls to rape them too. They were even buying small non-adult girls from slave markets to use them as sexual objects. They were swapping their slave girls and raping them. In short, Islamic Sharia turned Muslim men into serial rapists legally by giving them full control over the poor slave girls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId323910&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(10) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;Naturism&lt;/a&gt; in Western countries is totally different from the Islamic forced nakedness of slave women and their rape:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturism is not about sex, but it is based upon respect for humans and their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can force a woman to become topless or nude. And forget about rape, no one is allowed to even touch a woman without her consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturism is associated with absolutely no evil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers who blame Naturism for the rise in divorce rates in Western countries are mistaken. Indigenous tribes have practiced Naturism for centuries and still maintain strong family systems and successful marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual reasons behind the increasing divorce rates in Western countries differ. Advancements in technology and societal structures have made life more manageable for people, reducing their reliance on family support. This convenience has contributed to the higher divorce rates. If challenging times were to resurface and people once again required family support for survival, the family system would naturally strengthen once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is evident in Gulf Muslim countries where the divorce rate has reached 50%, even surpassing some Western countries. Despite practicing no Naturism and adhering to full Hijab, the high divorce rate is attributed to the fact that people in these affluent Gulf countries do not necessarily rely on strong family systems to sustain themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribal system, much like the family system, was robust in the past when people depended on their tribes for survival. However, in modern times, especially in cities, the tribal system has diminished as a society no longer requires tribal support to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId354264&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(11) The case of Hijab in the Islamic countries is totally Opposite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Naturist Movement in Western countries is not compelling Muslim women to become topless, but it is liberating all humans. It is about human rights and respecting one's choice for his/her dressing. Modesty and decency are not hidden in the Hijab, but modesty and decency are to &lt;strong&gt;RESPECT&lt;/strong&gt; the women and their choices. The Western world is the most decent, as it educates men to &lt;b&gt;RESPECT&lt;/b&gt; women and their choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the issue of the Hijab in Islamic countries is totally opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic Hijab is plagued by several evils:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first evil is the blatant discrimination and humiliation it inflicts on millions of slave women. Islamic Sharia historically prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab, reserving it only for free Muslim women as a symbol of respect and honor. Muslim women today should not view the Hijab as a personal choice but should stand with us in protesting against this extreme injustice faced by millions of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second evil of the Islamic Hijab is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hijab is practically IMPOSED by force upon the private lives of millions of women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a TOOL in the hands of men, in order to take away their liberties and make them dependent upon men so that men can exploit them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hijab is used in order to usurp the basic human rights of women. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Hijab's demands of women extend to limiting their movement within the confines of their homes, forbidding unnecessary interactions with men. This gender segregation breeds further problems, leading men to fetishize even the smallest glimpses of women's bodies due to the lack of normal exposure. The restrictions imposed by the Hijab and Islamic modesty contribute to sexual frustration among Muslim men and hinder natural interactions between men and women, preventing understanding and respectful treatment. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Please read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Islamic Hijab &amp;amp; Modesty حياء leads only towards Sexual Frustration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, a natural emotion, is stifled by the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء). Islam disapproves of love stories like Layla and Majnun (comparable to Romeo and Juliet) and severely punishes individuals involved in love. Islam employs the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء) to suppress and control this natural emotion, reflecting an approach contrary to embracing nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Islamic practice, girls are practically coerced into marrying men they have never interacted with or know little about their mentality and personality. This not only makes the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء) oppressive but also qualifies as crimes against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imposition of the Hijab transforms women's lives into a constant struggle, subjecting them to numerous hardships daily. To witness the actual ramifications of these evils, please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=4&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Negative role of 'Hijab' and 'Islamic Modesty' in the incident of Ifk&lt;/a&gt; (Highly recommended)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId554334&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(12) Muslim Youth in Islamic Societies have no chance to get rid of their Sexual Frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In earlier centuries, Muslim men had opportunities to interact with the opposite sex, while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There were thousands of slave women present in public (and even their breasts were naked).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslim men also raping the slave women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And even Muhammad was moving in public while holding the hands of slave girls of other men (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6072&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6072&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4177&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 4177&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern times, the existence of slave women, thanks to the influence of the Western world, is no longer prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Muslim boys face challenges in getting married until they reach around 30 years of age. They often prioritize obtaining an education, securing a stable job, and saving a significant amount of money for dowry, also known as Haq Mehr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unnatural restrictions imposed by Islam on the interaction between the opposite sexes inevitably result in extreme sexual frustration among Muslim youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incident from the time of Muhammad, the Sahaba (companions), highlights the struggle of controlling their desires. Initially, Muhammad/Allah forbade them from having sexual relations with their wives during the nights of Ramadan. However, unable to cope, the Sahaba secretly visited their wives during Ramadan nights. Eventually, Muhammad/Allah had to revoke this order and permit the Sahaba to engage in sexual activity during Ramadan nights. This incident is documented in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surah Al-Baqarah (2:187)&lt;br /&gt;“It is (now) made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting) ... Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves (by going to wives secretly), so He turned to you and forgave you (for this sin). So now you are allowed to have sexual relations with your wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/urn/178360&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4508&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Al-Bara': When the order of compulsory fasting of Ramadan was revealed, the people did not have sexual relations with their wives for the whole month of Ramadan, but some men cheated themselves (by violating that restriction). So Allah revealed: &quot;Allah is aware that you were deceiving yourselves but He accepted your repentance and forgave you..&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inability of Sahaba to control their sexual desires for 30 nights during Ramadan raises questions about how Muslim youth today can possibly suppress their desires for an extended period of 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim preachers suggest fasting as a means to control sexual desires, but it's evident that even Sahaba, who were also fasting during Ramadan, struggled with their desires for those 30 nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Muslim argument is to marry boys and girls at the age of 12. However, this is not practical, as even Muhammad himself did not marry until the age of 25. Many fathers do not wish for their daughters to marry someone who is not financially stable. No father wants his daughter to face hunger. No father wants her daughter to become a baby-producing machine at the age of 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These realities lead to extreme sexual frustration in Islamic societies, with no apparent solution to escape this issue. The problem persists and poses significant challenges to Muslim youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;No. The evolution of human societies is not linked to this practice of hijab. There are thousands of tribes, which even exist today, where women and men are totally naked or women are topless. There are tons of videos on YouTube about them. For example, look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newatlantisline&quot;&gt;Youtube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel is making a mistake, whereas there were only a handful of societies that imposed hijab on women historically, and they did it only to differentiate between free women of noble families and slave women/prostitutes. They prohibited slave women and prostitutes from wearing hijab and from resembling free women from noble families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elite women in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Byzantine, Greek, and Persian empires wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_80-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-80&quot;&gt;[79]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria had explicit &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sumptuary laws&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_laws&quot;&gt;sumptuary laws&lt;/a&gt; detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Ahmed_1992_15_80-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-Ahmed_1992_15-80&quot;&gt;[79]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-El_Guindi_2-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#cite_note-El_Guindi-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad only followed those few societies in this discrimination; he banned slave women from wearing hijab. Umar ibn Al-Khattab used to beat slave women with a stick if they wore hijab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by wearing hijab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's companions used to molest women who went out to relieve themselves in the evening for nature's call. Upon that, Muhammad ordered free Muslim women, in the name of revelation, to wear hijab so that they could be recognized as free women and not molested as slave women were molested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad also kept the breasts of slave women naked in public. Yes, there were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. They were sold in that same naked state in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, as Islam prohibited Slave Women from taking a Hijab or even covering their naked breasts in public 🔥ʰᵒᵗ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId635954&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(2) Daniel claims that AIDS is spreading due to TEMPORARY Sexual Relationships in non-Muslim countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But Islam also allowed &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEMPORARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sexual Relationships with dozens of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Islam, a man is allowed to buy a slave woman (or capture a prisoner woman) and rape her legally. And when he fulfils his lust, then she can be handed over to his brother, or male slave. And when all brothers and slaves have raped her one by one in a &lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship, then she can be sold to 2nd master, who again rapes her and sells her to the 3rd master .... and thus the rape of poor slave woman continued in such a &lt;strong&gt;TEMPORARY&lt;/strong&gt; sexual relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read the details in our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the original Islamic Sharia could not have saved Muslims from HIV due to temporary sexual relationships with dozens of slave women. Muslims have been saved from HIV only when the Western world compelled them to abolish Slavery, which is permitted (Halal) in Sharia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, instead of criminalizing natural behaviors between consenting adults and forbidding people from engaging in them, the solution to preventing illness transmission through sexual activity lies in finding treatments for such diseases and implementing measures to stop their propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIDS research has advanced considerably, leading to fewer HIV-related fatalities than those caused by conditions such as diabetes&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Health/uk-doctor-id-hiv-diabetes/story?id=23349162&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR2pDq3PiGgquKqzomP-5RoAgokJh_cl0fgQ5UPSR7-0HSeoRt7g4sTQxO8&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId628608&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(3) Daniel's argument of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_guarding_in_humans&quot;&gt;Mate-Guarding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel's claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_guarding_in_humans&quot;&gt;Mate-Guarding&lt;/a&gt; is a part of human evolution and even of apes is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Bonobo apes, unlike other apes, do not practice mate-guarding. This behavior is influenced by their environment, where food is abundant and competition for mates is not as intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even among chimpanzees, females engage in relations with multiple males despite the concept of mate-guarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In human societies, there have been and still are several cultures where a woman can have multiple husbands, as seen in this link (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry#:%7E:text=Polyandry%20has%20been%20practised%20in,only%20among%20higher%20caste%20women.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, look at the Inuit culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/inuit-social-organization%3E&quot;&gt;The Canadian Encyclopedia: &quot;Inuit: Social Organization&quot;&lt;/a&gt; - This article states, &quot;When a man left his home for an extended period, a neighbor or friend took care of his family, including his wife. Children born from such arrangements were considered equal members of the household.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uaf.edu/anthropology/faculty/dietz/inuit_culture_and_society/%3E&quot;&gt;The University of Alaska Fairbanks' &quot;Inuit Culture and Society&quot; page&lt;/a&gt; - This resource notes, &quot;Inuit families were often fluid and flexible, with children being raised by multiple caregivers. When a man had to leave his home for an extended period, a neighbor or friend would take care of his family, including his wife. Children born from these arrangements were considered full members of the household.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples show that mate-guarding is not a universal behavior among animals or humans, and various cultural practices and environmental factors influence mating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, in Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Swapping of slave women is also allowed (i.e. two masters can swap their slave girls, and rape them without their consent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;A Muslim master can take the slave-wife of his male slave from him, and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, he can return her to his male slave. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;And if a slave woman is shared between multiple masters, and they do sex with her one by one, then the child will have officially multiple fathers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And it is the right of the owner either to accept the child from his slave women as his own or to deny the child his name. In this case, that child will be called a Bastard (Islamic Terminology is &quot;Walad al-Haram ولد الحرام&quot;), and the child becomes the slave of his own father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read this detailed article for swapping, shared slave women and parentage of a child from a slave woman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery Against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam has no problem with men having sex with 4 wives and dozens of slave girls (which he can rotate by selling older slave girls and buying new slave girls). Thus, Islam denies any mate-guarding in the case of men. It allows men to enjoy their lives. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Islam didn't allow Muslim men to buy and rape new slave girls out of any &lt;strong&gt;NECESSITY&lt;/strong&gt;, but it allowed them in order to fulfil their &lt;strong&gt;LUST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;What about the poor male slave who could not mate guard his wife, and the owner took his wife away from him and raped her? What kind of Islamic Mate Guauding is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And in mate guarding, the males didn't hand over their females to other males after &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; sexual relationships. But Islam allows the owner to have a &quot;temporary&quot; sexual relationship with his slave girl, and after fulfilling his lust, he can hand her over to his brother or slave, or sell her to another master. Therefore, this trait of Islam is not even counted as mate guarding, but Islam is only guarding men and their lust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Islam only comes into play when it needs to place restrictions on women in the name of mate guarding. The sole excuse is that women should not be allowed to enjoy their lives while there is an issue of determining the paternity of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the issue of paternity can be easily resolved with modern medical tests and DNA. Yet, Muslims still refuse to allow women to enjoy their lives and instead force them to wait for their husbands (even if they are preoccupied with other wives or slave girls, or if they are weak in sex and cannot satisfy them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older women or those who are already pregnant have no chance of becoming pregnant again. Nevertheless, Islam denies them any opportunity to enjoy their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be acceptable if both partners agreed to be exclusive in their marriage or partnership. However, Islam has become one-sided, permitting men to have multiple sexual partners while imposing restrictions solely on women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel's claim is based on the notion that only men bear financial responsibilities for children. Therefore, women should not have the authority to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the right to decide on abortion is not about a child, but about a fetus. The fetus has not yet been born, so there is no question of financial responsibility. Furthermore, only women have to endure the entire nine-month pregnancy, including the associated risks and discomforts. Consequently, the right to decide about abortion belongs exclusively to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Daniel's perspective overlooks the practices in Western countries. In these societies, when a woman earns income, she also shares the financial responsibility for the child, just like the father does. If the woman earns more than the father, her financial contribution may exceed his. Moreover, custody decisions are based on the best interests of the child, regardless of the gender of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, women have the same responsibilities concerning their children as fathers do. If a father takes care of the children, the mother is expected to provide financial support to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of pregnancy and delivery, only women have to endure the painful process, while husbands do not have a role in this biological aspect. Therefore, it is logical that women should have the right to make decisions regarding delivery or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, even if we were to accept that Islam places the burden of financial responsibility squarely on the shoulders of fathers, this would only serve to highlight the inherent flaws in the system. Under Islamic law, a father remains financially liable for his children and wife, even if he becomes impoverished or severely disabled and unable to work. On the other hand, a wealthy wife is not obligated to contribute financially to her husband's needs or those of her children. This glaring disparity raises questions about the fairness and balance of the Islamic system. Why, then, do Islamic apologists boast about such an unjust arrangement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Islamic system is further criticized for declaring the wife and children as the property of the man under the guise of the husband's financial responsibility. He can beat his wife, even with bruises&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=20&amp;amp;catid=11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;), but the poor wife cannot take divorce on the basis of this brutal beating&lt;/span&gt;. And he can also beat children, and if he kills them, still he will not be physically punished for that, as children are considered his property in Islam. Unbelievable. Please read our article: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=154&amp;amp;catid=35&quot;&gt;A child is the father's property in Islamic Sharia, thus the father cannot be physically punished for killing his child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, due to this unjust financial responsibility imposed solely on fathers, Islam seeks to deprive women of their right in making choices regarding delivery or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId399691&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(5) Depression is all-time high in Islamic countries like Pakistan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel's conclusion about Western people suffering more from depression than in Islamic countries is unsubstantiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of depression in Islamic countries, like Pakistan, is significant higher, as indicated in this research: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728784/#:~:text=Depression%20is%20a%20debilitating%20mood,at%2047%25%20%5B8%5D&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728784/#:~:text=Depression%20is%20a%20debilitating%20mood,at%2047%25%20%5B8%5D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the depression of women in Islamic countries is often underreported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, people experienced depression even with simple restrictions like wearing a mask. In contrast, Muslim women are required to wear the whole Hijab (and even Niqab). It is natural that the Hijab and Niqab are a source of extreme depression for a lot of Muslim women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Muslim women are discouraged from leaving their homes, and face discomfort when venturing outside. Their freedom of movement is limited, causing them to experience distressing situations when they are outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, also think about the depression that slave women had to suffer due to Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their masters could rape them against their consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Their masters could hand them over to any of their brothers or male slaves to rape them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The master could break their family life, take the slave wife from his male slaves, and rape her. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The masters could separate the slave mothers from their children, and sell them (or their babies) in the Bazaars of Islamic slavery after the child had got 2 teeth (at 6 months approximately). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad allowed his followers to rape the captive minor and virgin girls the first night, although they had killed their fathers and brothers during the daytime. Just imagine the trauma those poor girls had to endure in that situation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There is an extensive list of documented crimes committed by Islam against humanity concerning the treatment of slave girls. For more in-depth information, please refer to our detailed article titled: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In addition to this, Daniel's claim regarding the higher suicide rate in Western countries as evidence of Western women being in depression is incorrect. Studies have shown that Western people tend to report higher levels of happiness compared to individuals in Islamic countries. However, in cases where individuals are suffering from severe illnesses and have lost interest in life, they may seek the right to Euthanasia (which some Muslims mistakenly label as suicide). Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=118&amp;amp;catid=17&quot;&gt;Suicide: Why the rate of suicide is higher in the Atheist Community?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId188243&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(6) Daniel claims that EQUAL human rights for women are the reason for the higher Divorce rate in Western countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel argues that equal human rights for women are behind the high divorce rates in Western nations. However, a closer examination of affluent Islamic countries like Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia tells a different story. Despite women lacking equal rights in these societies, the divorce rate exceeds 50%, surpassing that of numerous non-Muslim Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It appears that wealth alone can drive up the divorce rate, regardless of gender equality. When women become financially independent, they refuse to tolerate exploitation. Meanwhile, the Islamic system perpetuates the subjugation of women, treating them as mere slaves. Perhaps Muslims should follow through on this logic and enslave their women entirely; that way, they could achieve a zero divorce rate while Islam gives absolutely no human rights to slave women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at Pakistan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Pakistan is at the top in the search for INCEST Porn in the world (for the last 2 decades).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;80% of child girls are raped by their fathers, brothers, cousins, uncles, and grandfathers. Their cases are not even registered in the police stations. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=10&amp;amp;catid=9&quot;&gt;Incest in Islamic Pakistan.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Pakistan is at the top in search of terms like &quot;donkey rape&quot; on Google. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thousands of children are being raped in Quran Schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Women are molested by mobs. This thing never happens in Western countries. It may be individual men indulge in abuses against women, but never a mob of men molest a woman. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim women are even molested during Hajj (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220114154056/https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/s3v9fb/sexual_assault_during_hajj/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While western women at disco parties and beaches are safer from molestation than Muslim women during Hajj gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read our articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId918743&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(8) Apologist Argument: If Muslim states enforce the Hijab for women, then Western countries also impose restrictions on public nudity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with Muslim preachers is their denial of the &quot;Evolution of Dress,&quot; which is a factual phenomenon. The evolution of dress began as a response to weather conditions, as our ancestors migrated to colder or hotter regions. They needed clothing for protection against extreme temperatures, while modern humans lost their body hair, leaving them vulnerable to the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the way people dressed became a symbol of status, with women from wealthy families covering themselves more, while women from poorer families or slaves often remained naked or partially clothed. This evolution eventually turned into a fashion trend. The lower class people, including slaves, often wore little to no clothing, and the upper class wore very luxurious clothing. Clothing norms evolved from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothing has an interesting history, but it wasn’t originally invented for “modesty” reasons. Actually, ancient people had no issue with clothing at all, and dress codes became established relatively recently on a human history timescale. It was these dress codes that led to the cultural aversion in some places of people being naked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question arises: Why do Muslim preachers solely use Western countries as their example? They should also consider indigenous tribes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@newatlantisline&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) that have practised &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;Naturism&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. a lifestyle of practising non-sexual social &lt;a title=&quot;Nudity&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity&quot;&gt;nudity&lt;/a&gt; in private and in public) for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these tribes move naked in public without any dress, they still maintain a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;strong family system&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;These tribes don’t have rape and sexual assault as a big issue within them, and men and women see each other COMPLETELY NAKED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Compared to this, millions of Muslim women experience extreme molestation in Muslim countries despite wearing the Hijab. Even during the most religious Hajj gatherings, Muslim girls are exposed to extreme molestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1d00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #fbeeb8;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not showing men women's bodies is only going to make them fetishize the tiniest detail they do get to see. If women's bodies were treated normally, men would get used to them and not fetishize every tiny part of them. The same is true if you don't let men talk and interact with women. It will never allow them to understand women and their feelings and how to deal with them respectfully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read all details in this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western countries, too, have experienced a gradual evolution of dress. Influenced by the Christian religion for centuries, many Westerners still adhere to conservative dress codes. However, there is a growing movement of naturists in these countries, leading to the establishment of hundreds of nude beaches where nudity is completely normalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Denmark, nudism is permitted along 4,500 kilometres of coastline (where kids are also present along with families), and the same applies to other Scandinavian countries (source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/naturists-in-scandinavia/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/naturists-in-scandinavia/&lt;/a&gt;). While private offices and government institutions may have specific dress codes, in your personal life, you are even free to wear a bikini in public places. Despite the presence of bikinis in public or even total nudity on beaches, women in Western countries are not subjected to molestation and generally enjoy a safer environment compared to Muslim women, who unfortunately face instances of molestation even during Hajj gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, there is technically no law about nudity in Denmark. There is a relevant law, though, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;It is forbidden to display obscene or offensive behavior, that is likely to offend others or to outrage bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;Here’s the Danish text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;Det er forbudt at udvise uanstændig eller anstødelig opførsel, der er egnet til at forulempe andre eller vække offentlig forargelse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start&quot;&gt;The relevant word is “likely”. This makes the application of the law highly situational. Except for religious people in Denmark, other people will probably soon stop getting offended even if others move totally nude in public. It is just like indigenous tribes move naked and it is totally NORMAL for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Here is an introduction to the history of Nudity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;history of nudity&lt;/b&gt; involves social attitudes to nakedness of the human body in different cultures in history. The use of clothing to cover the body is one of the changes that mark the end of the Neolithic, and the beginning of civilizations. Nudity (or near-complete nudity) has traditionally been the social norm for both men and women in hunter-gatherer cultures in warm climates, and it is still common among many indigenous peoples. The need to cover the body is associated with human migration out of the tropics into climates where clothes were needed as protection from sun, heat, and dust in the Middle East; or from cold and rain in Europe and Asia. The first use of animal skins and cloth may have been as adornment, along with body modification, body painting, and jewelry, invented first for other purposes, such as magic, decoration, cult, or prestige. The skills used in their making were later found to be practical as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern societies, complete nudity in public became increasingly rare as nakedness became associated with lower status, but the mild Mediterranean climate allowed for a minimum of clothing, and in a number of ancient cultures, the athletic and/or cultist nudity of men and boys was a natural concept. In &lt;a title=&quot;Ancient Greece&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece&quot;&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;, nudity became associated with the perfection of the gods. In &lt;a title=&quot;Ancient Rome&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome&quot;&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;, complete nudity could be a public disgrace, though it could be seen at the public baths or in erotic art. In the Western world, with the spread of Christianity, any positive associations with nudity were replaced with concepts of sin and shame. Although rediscovery of Greek ideals in the Renaissance restored &lt;a title=&quot;Nude (art)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_%28art%29&quot;&gt;the nude&lt;/a&gt; to symbolic meaning in art, by the &lt;a title=&quot;Victorian era&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era&quot;&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt;, public nakedness was considered obscene. In Asia, public nudity has been viewed as a violation of social propriety rather than sin; embarrassing rather than shameful. However, in &lt;a title=&quot;Tokugawa shogunate&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, mixed-gender communal bathing was quite normal and commonplace until the &lt;a title=&quot;Meiji Restoration&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration&quot;&gt;Meiji Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the upper classes had turned clothing into &lt;a title=&quot;Fashion&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion&quot;&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;, those who could not afford otherwise continued to swim or bathe openly in natural bodies of water or frequent communal baths through the 19th century. Acceptance of public nudity re-emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosophically based movements, particularly in Germany, opposed the rise of industrialization. &lt;a title=&quot;Freikörperkultur&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freik%C3%B6rperkultur&quot;&gt;Freikörperkultur&lt;/a&gt; (Free Body Culture) represented a return to nature and the elimination of shame. In the 1960s &lt;a title=&quot;Naturism&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;naturism&lt;/a&gt; moved from being a small subculture to part of a general rejection of restrictions on the body. Women reasserted the right to uncover their breasts in public, which had been the norm until the 17th century. The trend continued in much of Europe, with the establishment of many clothing-optional areas in parks and on beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all of the historical changes in the &lt;a title=&quot;Developed country&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country&quot;&gt;developed countries&lt;/a&gt;, cultures in the tropical climates of &lt;a title=&quot;Sub-Saharan Africa&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa&quot;&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon rainforest&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest&quot;&gt;Amazon rainforest&lt;/a&gt; have continued with their traditional practices, being partially or completely nude during everyday activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId985135&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(9) Islam itself Practiced NUDITY (and the worst form of it while it was a FORCED Nudity)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic Preachers totally forget these realities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It was Islam who made slave women move in public topless. There were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad and in public with naked breasts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat them with a stick for taking Hijab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by taking the Hijab. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is 1300 year long history of Islam where slave women had to stay topless. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And Islam turned poor slave women into sexual objects too, and Muslim men were given licences to fulfil their sexual lusts by raping them. They were presented in that naked state in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery, where Muslim customers were also allowed to touch their private parts (just like sheep and cattle are groped before purchase). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And Muslim men were molesting slave women, without any fear of physical punishment, while Allah (i.e. Muhammad) didn't punish or even rebuked them for molesting slave women. Muslim men were raping slave girls in Temporary Sexual Relationships, and selling them, in order to buy new slave girls to rape them too. They were even buying small non-adult girls from slave markets to use them as sexual objects. They were swapping their slave girls and raping them. In short, Islamic Sharia turned Muslim men into serial rapists legally by giving them full control over the poor slave girls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see all proofs in these two articles: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt;Islam Prohibited Slave Women from Taking Hijab or Even Covering Their Naked Breasts in Public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId323910&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(10) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism&quot;&gt;Naturism&lt;/a&gt; in Western countries is totally different from the Islamic forced nakedness of slave women and their rape:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturism is not about sex, but it is based upon respect for humans and their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can force a woman to become topless or nude. And forget about rape, no one is allowed to even touch a woman without her consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturism is associated with absolutely no evil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers who blame Naturism for the rise in divorce rates in Western countries are mistaken. Indigenous tribes have practiced Naturism for centuries and still maintain strong family systems and successful marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual reasons behind the increasing divorce rates in Western countries differ. Advancements in technology and societal structures have made life more manageable for people, reducing their reliance on family support. This convenience has contributed to the higher divorce rates. If challenging times were to resurface and people once again required family support for survival, the family system would naturally strengthen once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is evident in Gulf Muslim countries where the divorce rate has reached 50%, even surpassing some Western countries. Despite practicing no Naturism and adhering to full Hijab, the high divorce rate is attributed to the fact that people in these affluent Gulf countries do not necessarily rely on strong family systems to sustain themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribal system, much like the family system, was robust in the past when people depended on their tribes for survival. However, in modern times, especially in cities, the tribal system has diminished as a society no longer requires tribal support to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId354264&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(11) The case of Hijab in the Islamic countries is totally Opposite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Naturist Movement in Western countries is not compelling Muslim women to become topless, but it is liberating all humans. It is about human rights and respecting one's choice for his/her dressing. Modesty and decency are not hidden in the Hijab, but modesty and decency are to &lt;strong&gt;RESPECT&lt;/strong&gt; the women and their choices. The Western world is the most decent, as it educates men to &lt;b&gt;RESPECT&lt;/b&gt; women and their choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the issue of the Hijab in Islamic countries is totally opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Islamic Hijab is plagued by several evils:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first evil is the blatant discrimination and humiliation it inflicts on millions of slave women. Islamic Sharia historically prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab, reserving it only for free Muslim women as a symbol of respect and honor. Muslim women today should not view the Hijab as a personal choice but should stand with us in protesting against this extreme injustice faced by millions of slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second evil of the Islamic Hijab is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hijab is practically IMPOSED by force upon the private lives of millions of women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a TOOL in the hands of men, in order to take away their liberties and make them dependent upon men so that men can exploit them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hijab is used in order to usurp the basic human rights of women. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Hijab's demands of women extend to limiting their movement within the confines of their homes, forbidding unnecessary interactions with men. This gender segregation breeds further problems, leading men to fetishize even the smallest glimpses of women's bodies due to the lack of normal exposure. The restrictions imposed by the Hijab and Islamic modesty contribute to sexual frustration among Muslim men and hinder natural interactions between men and women, preventing understanding and respectful treatment. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Please read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=1&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Islamic Hijab &amp;amp; Modesty حياء leads only towards Sexual Frustration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, a natural emotion, is stifled by the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء). Islam disapproves of love stories like Layla and Majnun (comparable to Romeo and Juliet) and severely punishes individuals involved in love. Islam employs the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء) to suppress and control this natural emotion, reflecting an approach contrary to embracing nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Islamic practice, girls are practically coerced into marrying men they have never interacted with or know little about their mentality and personality. This not only makes the Hijab and Islamic decency (حياء) oppressive but also qualifies as crimes against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imposition of the Hijab transforms women's lives into a constant struggle, subjecting them to numerous hardships daily. To witness the actual ramifications of these evils, please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=4&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Negative role of 'Hijab' and 'Islamic Modesty' in the incident of Ifk&lt;/a&gt; (Highly recommended)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId554334&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(12) Muslim Youth in Islamic Societies have no chance to get rid of their Sexual Frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In earlier centuries, Muslim men had opportunities to interact with the opposite sex, while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There were thousands of slave women present in public (and even their breasts were naked).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslim men also raping the slave women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And even Muhammad was moving in public while holding the hands of slave girls of other men (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6072&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6072&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4177&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 4177&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern times, the existence of slave women, thanks to the influence of the Western world, is no longer prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Muslim boys face challenges in getting married until they reach around 30 years of age. They often prioritize obtaining an education, securing a stable job, and saving a significant amount of money for dowry, also known as Haq Mehr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unnatural restrictions imposed by Islam on the interaction between the opposite sexes inevitably result in extreme sexual frustration among Muslim youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incident from the time of Muhammad, the Sahaba (companions), highlights the struggle of controlling their desires. Initially, Muhammad/Allah forbade them from having sexual relations with their wives during the nights of Ramadan. However, unable to cope, the Sahaba secretly visited their wives during Ramadan nights. Eventually, Muhammad/Allah had to revoke this order and permit the Sahaba to engage in sexual activity during Ramadan nights. This incident is documented in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surah Al-Baqarah (2:187)&lt;br /&gt;“It is (now) made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Siyam (fasting) ... Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves (by going to wives secretly), so He turned to you and forgave you (for this sin). So now you are allowed to have sexual relations with your wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/urn/178360&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4508&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Al-Bara': When the order of compulsory fasting of Ramadan was revealed, the people did not have sexual relations with their wives for the whole month of Ramadan, but some men cheated themselves (by violating that restriction). So Allah revealed: &quot;Allah is aware that you were deceiving yourselves but He accepted your repentance and forgave you..&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inability of Sahaba to control their sexual desires for 30 nights during Ramadan raises questions about how Muslim youth today can possibly suppress their desires for an extended period of 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim preachers suggest fasting as a means to control sexual desires, but it's evident that even Sahaba, who were also fasting during Ramadan, struggled with their desires for those 30 nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Muslim argument is to marry boys and girls at the age of 12. However, this is not practical, as even Muhammad himself did not marry until the age of 25. Many fathers do not wish for their daughters to marry someone who is not financially stable. No father wants his daughter to face hunger. No father wants her daughter to become a baby-producing machine at the age of 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These realities lead to extreme sexual frustration in Islamic societies, with no apparent solution to escape this issue. The problem persists and poses significant challenges to Muslim youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Danial blurring the faces of women and even their hands, as it sexually arouses Muslim men&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; padding: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1106/0*LpRGrCm9M-DVnyGE.&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;281&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; /&gt;According to Islamic apologists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to protect women is by covering them with a Hijab, and an even more effective approach is to keep them confined within the four walls of their homes, preventing them from going outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunger for Sex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” is a part of the '&lt;strong&gt;nature&lt;/strong&gt;' of men. Therefore, it is natural for them to become aroused after seeing a woman without a Hijab, or if they interact with them. A woman without Hijab becomes like an unwrapped candy that attracts flies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #eccafa;&quot;&gt;Absolutely, the key distinction is that a wrapped object lacks will, goals, dreams, and thoughts, while women possess these attributes. That's why no woman living in freedom would opt for the Hijab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad prohibited slave women to take the HIjab &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Muhammad also kept their breasts naked, as Islamic Sharia declared their 'Awrah (i.e. nakedness) from the navel to the knee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were thousands of slave women present in public with naked breasts during the era of Muhammad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And they were sold in this same semi-naked state in the bazaars of Slavery, where customers not only looked at their naked bodies but were also allowed to personally touch and check their private parts too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat those slave women, who even by mistake took the Hijab. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Muslims blame girls without hijabs to be immodest and prostitutes. But they are unable to see their own prophet and Sharia, which compelled millions of slave women to move in public without the Hijab and even with naked breasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=19&amp;amp;catid=10&quot;&gt;Hijab is not a sign of Modesty, but a sign of Discrimination and inhuman Insult against the Slave Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overcoming sexual frustration through natural interaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the citizens of Tokyo are renowned for their honesty, returning lost belongings such as wallets, money, and mobile phones in exceptional numbers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-10/why-japan-s-lost-and-found-system-works-so-well&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-religious Japan managed to control the &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunger for Money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&quot; which is also a part of human nature. The country achieved this by providing ample employment opportunities for its citizens, ensuring they could earn enough for their needs and livelihoods. Additionally, Japan prioritized moral education from childhood, resulting in a society that has transcended greed and material desires. As a consequence, its citizens voluntarily return lost money to the police, reflecting the peak of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, it is a fundamental human right for women to move freely and fearlessly within society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the non-religious Western world, natural interaction between men and women was fostered, allowing them to better understand and respect each other, thus mitigating the risk of sexual frustration. As a result, women can move alone in society without fear, even during nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Islam strictly prohibits natural interaction between men and women, forbidding them from talking or understanding each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build a civilized society, young boys should be taught to respect women, irrespective of their attire, and they should not be segregated from girls of their own age. Growing up together fosters mutual empathy, discouraging inappropriate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unnatural restrictions imposed by Islam have led to a sexually frustrated society, making it challenging for girls to move freely and safely. In Pakistan, this frustration has resulted in incidents of sexual violence, such as the rape of children in Quran Schools (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tribune.com.pk/story/1564321/madrassas-allegedly-infested-sexual-abuse-minors&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) and even despicable acts of raping dead women's bodies, after taking them out of their graves (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200917003435/https://www.dawn.com/news/1580011&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008000; background-color: #ccffcc;&quot;&gt;If you want to keep society barbaric and wild and uncivilized, then please imprison the women in their houses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #ffcc99;&quot;&gt;But if you want to make society educated and civilized, then put an end to these unnatural restrictions of religion, and instead of imprisoning the women in Burqa/Hijab and confining them to their homes, provide them with basic human rights, allowing them to breathe freely and live natural lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #ffcc99;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the morality in Quran and Sunnah is that a women's sexuality is a property of a man. When they say “protect women” they mean it in the same way as “protecting cattle from bandits”. The interest is in keeping the value of your property, not the well-being of the woman herself. That's why they see no issue with marital rape, or rape of slave women because that's their property, they are using their product, while somebody else raping your wife, then they are stealing your property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; padding: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1106/0*LpRGrCm9M-DVnyGE.&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;281&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; /&gt;According to Islamic apologists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best way to protect women is by covering them with a Hijab, and an even more effective approach is to keep them confined within the four walls of their homes, preventing them from going outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunger for Sex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” is a part of the '&lt;strong&gt;nature&lt;/strong&gt;' of men. Therefore, it is natural for them to become aroused after seeing a woman without a Hijab, or if they interact with them. A woman without Hijab becomes like an unwrapped candy that attracts flies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #eccafa;&quot;&gt;Absolutely, the key distinction is that a wrapped object lacks will, goals, dreams, and thoughts, while women possess these attributes. That's why no woman living in freedom would opt for the Hijab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad prohibited slave women to take the HIjab &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Muhammad also kept their breasts naked, as Islamic Sharia declared their 'Awrah (i.e. nakedness) from the navel to the knee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were thousands of slave women present in public with naked breasts during the era of Muhammad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And they were sold in this same semi-naked state in the bazaars of Slavery, where customers not only looked at their naked bodies but were also allowed to personally touch and check their private parts too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat those slave women, who even by mistake took the Hijab. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Muslims blame girls without hijabs to be immodest and prostitutes. But they are unable to see their own prophet and Sharia, which compelled millions of slave women to move in public without the Hijab and even with naked breasts. &lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Muslim women,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know that the Hijab was not originally introduced for the purpose of modesty? Its primary intention was to distinguish between free women and slave women. In ancient Arab tradition, Hijab symbolized the rights and honour of high-status women, while it was forbidden for prostitutes and slave women to wear it. Muhammad later re-introduced this age-old practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the city of Medina, men would sit along the streets, and in the evenings, when women came out of their houses to relieve themselves, they would face harassment. In response to this issue, Muhammad, the writer of the Quran, claimed the revelation of Verse 33:59, which introduced the concept of Hijab. This verse instructed Free Muslim women to wear Hijab when they went out so that they could be recognized as free women, differentiating them from slave women and, thereby, protecting them from molestation by Muhammad's companions in Medina.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#fff8dc&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quran 33:59:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; O Prophet! say to your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they let down upon them their over-garments; this will be more proper, so that they may be&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;recognized&lt;/span&gt; (as free Women)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; and&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;not molested&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, the slave women were not allowed to take the Hijab. In fact, even their breasts were also kept naked, as their ‘Awrah (i.e. nakedness) in Sharia is only from the navel to the knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thousands of slave women were compelled to move in public without the Hijab, and with naked breasts. They were present in that semi-naked state in front of Muhammad and in public. And if any slave woman took her Hijab by mistake, then Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat her with a stick and took her Hijab away. And he told her not to resemble the free Muslim women by taking the Hijab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The slave women were put to display in that same semi-naked state, in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery, where Muslim customers were also allowed to touch their private body parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, the Quran neither punished nor rebuked the men who molested women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Muslim Women,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take a moment to empathize with the millions of women who have endured humiliation due to the Hijab throughout history. We urge you to stand with us in protest against this symbol of discrimination and the demeaning treatment suffered by slave women for 14 centuries. If, for any personal reason, you choose to cover your body and hair, we respect your choice. However, let us refrain from labelling it as an &quot;Islamic Hijab.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Thank you for your understanding and solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Look at these Muslim men doing dramas of decency by not shaking hands with women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ak86GqPCSNw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;On one side Islam made life difficult for a woman in name of “Hijab and Decency حياء”, and practically imprisoned her in her home, and cut her off from the outside world, she could not even talk with other men, and even if she has to talk, then she must talk in a hard voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;But on the other hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Prophet Muhammad also prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab and even their breasts were kept naked in public (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women/37-women-and-hijab/11-islam-prohibited-slave-women-from-wearing-the-hijab-or-even-covering-their-naked-breasts-in-public&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;And it was also allowed to touch their body parts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prophet Muhammad himself used to walk in public while holding the hands of the slave girls of another man in his hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6072&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6072&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Anas bin Malik said, &quot;Any of the female slaves of Medina could take hold of the hand of Allah's Apostle and take him wherever she wished.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Please remember that this slave girl was there with naked breasts too, which makes things more complicated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Why did prophet Muhammad need to take her hand in his hand? Why were they not able to move in the city without taking each other’s hands? Slave girls were not sick that Muhammad had to give then hand as support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;This same tradition is also present in Sunan Ibn Majah too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4177&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 4177&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;“If a female slave among the people of Al-Medinah were to take the hand of the Messenger of Allah, he would not take his hand away from hers until she had taken him wherever she wanted in Al-Medinah so that her needs may be met.” &lt;/span&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Darussalam) and &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/42955&quot;&gt;Albani&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The same thing also later came into Fiqh, where one is allowed to touch those parts of non-Mahram slave women, which are visible (i.e. her whole body except from the navel to the knee). The authentic Hanafi Fiqh book Fatawa Alamgiri writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Alamgiri_Awrah_slave_woman.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;It is not permissible to look at the area between the navel and the knees of someone else's female slave. As for the rest of her body, there is no concern in looking at it ... Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;TOUCHING&lt;/strong&gt; the parts of her body that are permissible to look at is also allowed, provided there is no fear of desire or temptation arising for either oneself or the woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Why are these two opposite extremes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side, not only hairs but the whole body of a free woman is imprisoned in Jilbab. Or even worse, she is practically imprisoned in the 4 walls of the house. She is compelled to lead an unnatural life, where she is not even allowed to talk with men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other side, even the breasts of the slave women were kept naked. And even customers could touch their private parts like sheep and cattle. And Muhammad was moving while holding the hands of the slave women of other people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Yes, these are the two opposite extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This happens when no Allah is present above in the heavens, and a human with the intellect level of Muhammad had to make the revelations on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamists's Excuse: The Prophet was only KIND to the slave girls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is a lame excuse as Muhammad could be kind to them and go with them anywhere even without holding the hands of non-Mahram slave girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, there are tons of Gentlemen today who also want to be kind to girls by holding their hands. Why don't then you allow these Gentlemen to be kind today? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamists' Excuse: Hand can be hold if a young girl is UNDESIRABLE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Fatwa website, Islam QA  presented this excuse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/226616/commentary-on-the-words-of-anas-ibn-malik-one-of-the-slave-women-of-madinah-would-take-the-messenger-of-allah-by-the-hand-and-lead-him-wherever-she-wished&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case of &lt;strong&gt;a young girl who is not regarded as desirable&lt;/strong&gt;, one who is below the age of seven years, there is nothing wrong with looking at her and shaking hands with her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excuse from the Islamists is like trying to cover up one lie with a hundred more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Who is supposed to decide which girl is deemed desirable or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this rationale stems from yet another excuse, where Islamic Sharia prohibits slave women from wearing the hijab, viewing the hijab as an honour and a right reserved only for free Muslim women. To justify this, Islamists argue that Sharia discourages slave women from wearing the hijab because, due to their work and lack of beauty care, they would become &quot;&lt;strong&gt;undesirable&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and less attractive [&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women-and-hijab/11-islam-prohibited-hijab-for-slave-women-and-kept-their-breasts-naked&quot; class=&quot;mod-articles-category-title &quot; style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both excuses are weak, and basic common sense is enough to see through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamists' Excuse: Holding hands is only figurative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The largest Fatwa website, Islam QA further presented this another excuse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/226616/commentary-on-the-words-of-anas-ibn-malik-one-of-the-slave-women-of-madinah-would-take-the-messenger-of-allah-by-the-hand-and-lead-him-wherever-she-wished&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;They (i.e. Islamic scholars) did not interpret the taking of his hand that is mentioned in this hadith in terms of the apparent meaning of holding his hand. This is a well-known figure of speech in Arabic, as in the supplication “&lt;em&gt;Allahumma khudh bi aydina ilayka&lt;/em&gt;” (lit. “O Allah, take us by the hand and lead us to You (your path)”), which means: Enable us to submit to You – because when someone takes you by the hand, you have submitted to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The &quot;&lt;strong&gt;context&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; of Hadith in Bukhari is itself clear enough that it was not a metaphor, but it was used in its apparent meaning of holding hands, while Muhammad was &quot;&lt;strong&gt;physically present&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, and both of them were &quot;&lt;strong&gt;physically moving&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; in Medina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While in the supplication, the context makes it a metaphor, while Allah is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;physically absent&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, and the path towards him is also &quot;&lt;strong&gt;physically absent&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;ٰIn Persian language, it is said: &lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;عذر بدتر از گناه&lt;/span&gt; which means: &quot;The excuse for a sin is worse than the sin itself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Look at these Muslim men doing dramas of decency by not shaking hands with women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ak86GqPCSNw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;On one side Islam made life difficult for a woman in name of “Hijab and Decency حياء”, and practically imprisoned her in her home, and cut her off from the outside world, she could not even talk with other men, and even if she has to talk, then she must talk in a hard voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;But on the other hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Prophet Muhammad also prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab and even their breasts were kept naked in public (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/women/37-women-and-hijab/11-islam-prohibited-slave-women-from-wearing-the-hijab-or-even-covering-their-naked-breasts-in-public&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;And it was also allowed to touch their body parts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prophet Muhammad himself used to walk in public while holding the hands of the slave girls of another man in his hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6072&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6072&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Anas bin Malik said, &quot;Any of the female slaves of Medina could take hold of the hand of Allah's Apostle and take him wherever she wished.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Please remember that this slave girl was there with naked breasts too, which makes things more complicated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Why did prophet Muhammad need to take her hand in his hand? Why were they not able to move in the city without taking each other’s hands? Slave girls were not sick that Muhammad had to give then hand as support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;This same tradition is also present in Sunan Ibn Majah too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4177&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 4177&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;“If a female slave among the people of Al-Medinah were to take the hand of the Messenger of Allah, he would not take his hand away from hers until she had taken him wherever she wanted in Al-Medinah so that her needs may be met.” &lt;/span&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Darussalam) and &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/42955&quot;&gt;Albani&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The same thing also later came into Fiqh, where one is allowed to touch those parts of non-Mahram slave women, which are visible (i.e. her whole body except from the navel to the knee). The authentic Hanafi Fiqh book Fatawa Alamgiri writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/Alamgiri_Awrah_slave_woman.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;It is not permissible to look at the area between the navel and the knees of someone else's female slave. As for the rest of her body, there is no concern in looking at it ... Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;TOUCHING&lt;/strong&gt; the parts of her body that are permissible to look at is also allowed, provided there is no fear of desire or temptation arising for either oneself or the woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Why are these two opposite extremes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side, not only hairs but the whole body of a free woman is imprisoned in Jilbab. Or even worse, she is practically imprisoned in the 4 walls of the house. She is compelled to lead an unnatural life, where she is not even allowed to talk with men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other side, even the breasts of the slave women were kept naked. And even customers could touch their private parts like sheep and cattle. And Muhammad was moving while holding the hands of the slave women of other people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Yes, these are the two opposite extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This happens when no Allah is present above in the heavens, and a human with the intellect level of Muhammad had to make the revelations on his own.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Islamic Sharia and Islamic countries have been criticized for restricting women's choices in clothing, forcing them to wear the hijab against their will. However, Islamic apologists argue that women in Western societies face similar pressures, being compelled to wear revealing clothing instead of having the freedom to choose their desires. According to this line of thinking, non-Muslims should refrain from criticizing Islamic Sharia and Islamic countries for their dress code restrictions, given that Western societies also impose their own form of dress code compliance on women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check out this video by Ali Dawah, an Islamic apologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;330&quot; height=&quot;587&quot; title=&quot;Islamic Apologists: Women in Western societies are pressured into wearing revealing clothing&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfeZiIUM0KE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; sandbox=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unrealistic to assume that individuals can be completely shielded from social pressure. There will always be some level of influence, especially since we don't live in a flawless world. Moreover, this social pressure in the West is not due to any Law/Compulsion, but only due to Fashion/Trend, and it is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;minimal&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Western societies have found a solution to this issue by granting both narratives the freedom to express themselves under the guise of freedom of speech. This means that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one narrative can argue that the hijab oppresses women and prevents them from living freely and looking attractive,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while the opposing Muslim narrative can assert that women need to wear the hijab for their own safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, both viewpoints coexist in society, balancing each other out and providing individuals with a range of perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Islamic apologists claim that Western women are &quot;beauty sick,&quot; Muslims are free to share their beliefs and help these women supposedly recover from their illness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the Islamic States, it is a combination of two thing i.e. &lt;strong&gt;Compulsion through&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Law + Compulsion through Social Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, it is the &lt;strong&gt;LAW&lt;/strong&gt; which &lt;strong&gt;compels&lt;/strong&gt; women for a certain Islamic dress code. And not obeying it results in &lt;strong&gt;punishment&lt;/strong&gt;. They are fined and even imprisoned. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then comes the compulsion through social pressure too. And this social pressure is not a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; pressure like in the Western social pressure, but it is an &quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Extreme&lt;/span&gt; Social Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, it is the family which exerts this social pressure. And the &lt;strong&gt;extent of compulsion&lt;/strong&gt; of this social pressure even surpasses the extent of compulsion due to law. Girls are beaten by their families if they refuse to dress according to Islamic dress code and wear the Hijab. And they are even killed in the name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghayrah&quot;&gt;Ghayrah&lt;/a&gt; (Arabic: غَيْرَة). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to familial pressure, societal expectations also play a significant role in shaping the lives of girls and women in Islamic societies. Men often experience high levels of sexual frustration ins such societies, which can make it difficult for females to venture out in public without being subjected to harassment and catcalling. This creates a challenging environment for women to navigate, compelling them to conform to strict Islamic dress codes. Such catcalling and harassment also still exists in the West, but it is minimum as compared to Islamic societies, and gradually it is also vanishing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, Islamic countries don't allow non-Muslims to preach and criticize Islam and Sharia for making Hijab obligatory. They put a complete ban upon this counter-narrative. And this thing is known as 100% Religious Brainwashing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Islamic apologists are wrong on all fronts. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;It is a shame that we had to spend time to counter this foolish argument.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;In religious societies, there is so much pressure on girls that stories of oppression and injustice against them are considered normal and acceptable. People in the West, who enjoy freedom and equality, don't even realize the existence of this extreme oppression on millions of Muslim girls. Please read thousands of witnesses of girls from Muslim families on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/&quot;&gt;ex-Muslim subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, how this extreme pressure broke them mentally and how they were compelled to live under fear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is also wished that Islamic apologists would have answered these questions why Islam prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab, why Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat the slave women for taking the Hijab, and why Islam even kept their breasts naked in public. Please read the detailed article on this issue here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; Islam Prohibited Slave Women from Wearing the Hijab or Even Covering Their Naked Breasts in Public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Islam gets a free pass despite being the culprit of compelling slave women not to wear the Hijab and to move in public with naked breasts, but on the other hand Western system has become the sole criminal for compelling women for revealing clothes, although it never enforces anything. How blind should we be to digest such huge Double Standards?&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

This creates a challenging environment for women to navigate, compelling them to conform to strict Islamic dress codes. Such catcalling and harassment also still exists in the West, but it is minimum as compared to Islamic societies, and gradually it is also vanishing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, Islamic countries don't allow non-Muslims to preach and criticize Islam and Sharia for making Hijab obligatory. They put a complete ban upon this counter-narrative. And this thing is known as 100% Religious Brainwashing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Islamic apologists are wrong on all fronts. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;It is a shame that we had to spend time to counter this foolish argument.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;In religious societies, there is so much pressure on girls that stories of oppression and injustice against them are considered normal and acceptable. People in the West, who enjoy freedom and equality, don't even realize the existence of this extreme oppression on millions of Muslim girls. Please read thousands of witnesses of girls from Muslim families on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/&quot;&gt;ex-Muslim subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, how this extreme pressure broke them mentally and how they were compelled to live under fear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is also wished that Islamic apologists would have answered these questions why Islam prohibited slave women from wearing the Hijab, why Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat the slave women for taking the Hijab, and why Islam even kept their breasts naked in public. Please read the detailed article on this issue here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=11&amp;amp;catid=37&quot;&gt; Islam Prohibited Slave Women from Wearing the Hijab or Even Covering Their Naked Breasts in Public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Islam gets a free pass despite being the culprit of compelling slave women not to wear the Hijab and to move in public with naked breasts, but on the other hand Western system has become the sole criminal for compelling women for revealing clothes, although it never enforces anything. How blind should we be to digest such huge Double Standards?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

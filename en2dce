			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<p>We are ex-<a class="zem_slink" title="Muslim" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim" rel="wikipedia">Muslims</a> from all over the world, born and raised in Islam. We were taught never to question Islam and to believe in <a class="zem_slink" title="Allah" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah" rel="wikipedia">Allah</a> and his messenger with blind faith.</p>
<p>But there is a clash between Islam and Humanity. Finally, the Humanity within us won the war, and we committed the ultimate sin of thinking and questioning the belief that was imposed on us. And we came to realize that far from being a religion of truth, Islam is a hoax, and nothing but lies and deceit.</p>
<p><strong>What we believe:</strong></p>
<p>Some of us have embraced other religions, but most of us have simply left Islam without believing in any other religion. We believe in humanity. We believe that humans do not need to follow a religion to be good. All we need is to follow humanity within us. It is enough to tell us clear what is bad and what is good. It will never misguide us. This is the essence of all goodness.</p>
<p><strong>What is our goal?</strong></p>
<p>We are <a class="zem_slink" title="Apostasy in Islam" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam" rel="wikipedia">apostates of Islam</a>. We denounce Islam as a false doctrine of hate and terror. However, we are not against Muslims who are our own kin and relatives. We do not advocate hate and violence. Muslims are the main victims of Islam. Our goal is to educate them and let them see the truth.</p>
<p>We strive to bring Muslims into the fold of humanity. We fight to obtain our rights as citizens to declare our apostasy and not be persecuted for it. We want to be free from the tyranny of Islam in our own home countries. We strive for freedom of beliefs, for equality of gender and for the oneness of humankind.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Objection: People should avoid our website because it's biased and neither neutral nor academic:</strong></p>
<p>Islamists attempt to undermine our website by claiming it lacks neutrality and academic rigour in its approach to Islam.</p>
<p>Here's our response:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>We don't have to be neutral when we're the affected party</strong>: In a courtroom, the party that has been wronged isn't expected to be neutral. They have the right—even the obligation and duty —to present their side with evidence and arguments. If public figures like Zakir Naik can defend Islam, shouldn't we have the same right to critique it? These are only Double Standards of Islamists where they respect and accept defence of Islam by Zakir Naik, but dismiss our arguments against Islam by accusing us of being biased. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Readers are the judges, and they should remain neutral</strong>: Truly neutral sources are rare, and even those that claim neutrality often have subjective elements. It's up to you, as the reader, to examine the arguments from all sides and form your own opinion. This means gathering information from multiple perspectives and drawing your conclusions based on that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arguments based on original sources cannot be dismissed by blaming them biased</strong>: Islamists employ the tactic to reject all arguments against Islam but accusing them of being biased. But this does not work. In a court, only testimonies may be dismissed if they are biased. As for arguments, that are developed based on commonly accepted sources (Qur'an, Hadith, logic, mainstream scientific theories), it doesn't matter whether they are biased or not. You still have to tackle their arguments with arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An affected party in court doesn't need to be academic</strong>:  In a courtroom, it is not obligatory for the affected parties to be Academic. We are normal people and this website is also for normal people, and it is enough if we use the language of normal people to convey our message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, academic papers are free of human emotion, but we want our articles to have human emotions that can touch human hearts. As victims of Islamic oppression, it is our <strong>right</strong> to raise our voice against Islam as much as we can. Even Islam itself gives this right to victims to raise their voices against the oppressors. So why do Islamists want to snatch away our right to protest against Islam?</p>
<p>Moreover, the language of the Quran itself is not academic itself, but it<strong> insults Kafirs, and try to look them bad and teaches its followers that Kafirs:</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;">The question at hand is whether Islam represents a flawless divine revelation or merely a flawed human drama. By examining its content, one can determine its true nature and discern whether it bears the marks of divine wisdom or human fallibility. Take the time to read and reflect in order to arrive at your own conclusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;">According to Islam, Allah is believed to be completely 100% perfect. As a result, if it can be demonstrated that there is even a "single" scientific error in the Islamic revelation, it would undermine the entire foundation of Islam, which is built upon the premise of Allah's 100% infallibility. Modern Science is an <strong>ultimate weapon</strong> which will expose the false religions and dismantle their claims.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;">When Muhammad claimed to receive revelations about the unseen, no one could confirm or deny it since people never saw Gabriel. However, when any historical incident happened during the life of Muhammad, then many people became DIRECT eye-witnesses to that historical event, and they also narrated that incident further. However, the problem for Muslims was that many of those incidents were exposing Muhammad and Islam and proving them to be false. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Subsequent generations of Islamic apologists took two approaches to control the damage:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Firstly, they fabricated hundreds of thousands of false Ahadith to counter genuine incidents. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Secondly, they created Ilm-ul-Hadith (Science of Hadith), which should serve as a TOOL to declare any incident as WEAK and UNRELIABLE which exposed Muhammad/Islam.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;">It is impossible to prove these Ahadith as a fabrication as all hadith transmitters were Muslims. However, we are fortunate that contradictions in these fabrications sometimes expose them as lies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;">The following articles detail historical incidents where fabricated Hadith and Ilm-ul-Hadith were fortunately exposed due to CONTRADICTIONS within them.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, and other religions do not possess the capacity to draw Muslims towards their respective beliefs. However, atheism (irreligion) has been automatically eroding the ranks of Muslims and establishing its own presence. This phenomenon has been occurring since the inception of Islam, even without the presence of an organized atheist movement or active preaching. With the advent of modern science and the prevalence of secular systems, this trend has witnessed a significant surge in recent times.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #e03e2d;">My Last Words to Allah</span></h3>
<p>Even after fully comprehending that Islam is nothing more than a product of human revelations, I found it difficult to take the final step of leaving it behind and I remained attached to Islam for a while longer.</p>
<p>One question, in particular, weighed heavily on my mind: "<strong>What if Allah reveals Himself after my death?</strong>"</p>
<p>I thoroughly pondered this question from various angles before directing my last words to Allah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh Allah! If indeed You exist and possess insight into the depths of my heart, then You would perceive that I have sincerely sought the truth.</p>
<p>However, my honest pursuit has led me to firmly believe within my heart that You do not exist. It is my inherent sense of humanity that compels me to conclude that your system (Islam) is founded upon hostility towards humanity.</p>
<p>Do You truly desire for me to be a hypocrite? Should I outwardly acknowledge Your existence while internally denying it within my heart and mind?</p>
<p>And if I refuse to be a hypocrite, will You condemn me to eternal damnation, even though my heart is sincere? Will all the benevolent deeds I have performed for the betterment of humanity be in vain, leading me to eternal torment?</p>
<p>Therefore, if I am to be held accountable for my disbelief in You, then 'firstly,' You must provide answers for Your failure to present sufficient evidence of Your existence. You must explain why I could not recognize You despite my genuine quest. Why do You condemn billions of individuals, born into non-Muslim families by Your design, to suffer in eternal hellfire merely because they did not become Muslims?</p>
<p>If You reject my genuine intentions,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <span style="color: #0005ff;">then either Your promise of 'Verily, the reward of deeds depends on the <strong>intentions</strong>' is false</span>, or Your threat of eternal hellfire is false.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were my final words to Allah. I never addressed Him thereafter.</p>

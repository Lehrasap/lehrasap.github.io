<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId277008"></a>The mechanics of the invisible world :</h3>
<p>Every night, while the sun is prostrating under the Throne of god (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/1/306">https://sunnah.com/muslim/1/306</a>) and Devils are peeing in the ears of sleeping people (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/19/25">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/19/25</a>) and staying in their noses (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/104">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/104</a>) the Almighty descends to the lowest heaven, and says: Who supplicates Me so that I may answer him? Who asks Me so that I may give to him? Who asks Me forgiveness so that I may forgive him? (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/6/201">https://sunnah.com/muslim/6/201</a>) When he finishes collecting the prayers of people, he receives tons of questions from the Angels of the Uterus, they're thousands each one of them follow the developpement of babys in every womb and they say 'O Lord, semen! O Lord,it is now a clot! O Lord, it is now a piece of flesh.' And then, if Allah wishes to complete its creation, the angel asks, 'O Lord, will it be a male or a female? A wretched or a blessed doer of good? How much will his provisions be? What will his age be?' So all that is written while the creature is still in the mother's womb." (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/82/2">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/82/2</a>) In the meantime, some new Jihadis blew themselves and got up to heaven, so Allah the Almighty goes back to the seventh hevean and goes to visit them, He finds them in the bodies of green birds who have their nests in chandeliers hung from the throne. They eat the fruits of Paradise from wherever they like and then nestle in these chandeliers. Then he asks them : Do ye want anything? They say: What more shall we desire? We eat the fruit of Paradise from wherever we like. Their Lord ask them the same question thrice. When they see that they will continue to be asked and not left, they say: O Lord, we wish that Thou mayest return our souls to our bodies so that we may be slain in Thy way once again ((<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/33/181">https://sunnah.com/muslim/33/181</a>). When He sees that they don't need anything, he leaves them and Go to Issue Orders to The Angels, so they start beating with their wings in obedience to His Statement which sounds like that of a chain dragged over a rock. (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/107">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/107</a>) Until the Orders reaches the Angels of the Cloud, and they speak between them about those orders but devils who spy on them hear words of what they say and pour it in the ears of a soothsayer as one pours something in a bottle, and they add one hundred lies to that (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/97">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/97</a>) But sometimes A flame may overtake and burn the spy devil before conveying the news to the one below him (<a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/43780">https://sunnah.com/urn/43780</a>) In the meantime, two groups of angels follow every person on earth, a team in the morning and a team at night, they shift places and when every team finishes the job, they get back to the seventh heaven to their Lord, and he asks them "In what state did you leave My slaves?' The angels reply, 'When we left them, they were praying, and when we reached them they were praying.' " (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/56">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/56</a>) And there's a Third team of Angels writing down the list of people who attend the prayer at Mosque, On every Friday they take their stand at every gate of the mosque to write the names of the people chronologically and when the Imam sits on the pulpit they fold up their scrolls and get ready to listen to the sermon." (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/22">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/22</a>) But at that time, devils are fleeing while farting, because they cant support the Adhan, they flee five times a day at every prayer. (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/4/19">https://sunnah.com/muslim/4/19</a>) They only stop fleeing in Ramadan, because they are chained and the gates of heaven are open and the gates of hell closed (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/30/9">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/30/9</a>). And lets not forget about the angel standing in the right of every one writing down his good deeds (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/8/66">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/8/66</a>)</p>

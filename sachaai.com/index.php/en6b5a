		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Indeed, We created humans in the best form.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (95:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;So blessed be Allah, the best of creators!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (23:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The work of Allah who has perfected everything (He created).&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (27:88)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“He is the One Who has made perfectly everything He has created.”&lt;/strong&gt; (32:7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;You will never see any imperfection in the creation of the Most Compassionate. So look again: do you see any flaws?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (67:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran clearly states that everything allah has made is perfect and has no flaws whatsoever. Yet when birth defects and genetic mutations are brought up, apologists will claim that they're simply &quot;part of allah's plan&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many flaws in animal bodies, but listing them all would take forever (See: giraffe's neck design and how it could've been designed better) so I'm only going to talk about the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example a woman's pelvis being too narrow, which makes child birth extremely painful. But some muslims don't acknowledge this and keep on defending child marriage (that's ongoing in countries like yemen, afghanistan, lebanon, etc.) and making these young girls suffer through child birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah purposefully made the pelvis too narrow to make child birth painful, and then he allows child marriage so little girls have to suffer through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do these seem like the actions of an all-merciful god? Or was all of this part of his plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. So many creationists point out to the human eye as proof of god's intelligent design, and how it couldn't have been made through evolution. However, the human eye has many flaws such as a backwards retina and a blind spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This design forces light to travel the length of each cell, as well as through blood and tissue, to reach the equivalent of a receiver on the cell’s backside. The setup may encourage the retina to detach from its supporting tissue, which is a leading cause of blindness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which doesn't make sense at all why a designer would do this, because some animals like squids and octopuses don't have a backward retina, thus they don't have a blind spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some animals also have better eyes than humans, such as owls and eagles. And some of them have better eyesight in nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the human eye is not perfect at all, nor is it intelligent design. The fact that people have to wear glasses is proof of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Humans have a lot of unused muscles that are leftovers from evolution, such as the palmaris longus muscle which runs from the wrist to the elbow. One in ten people will not have this muscle in either arm. If we would hang out in trees, these muscles would come in handy. They help strengthen our grip. So not many people have this muscle, which is proof it's devolving from the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so they are definitely remnants of our primate past and disprove creationist theories. They would make sense if Adam and Eve were some ape-like creatures who travelled by hanging on trees, but the quran &amp;amp; hadith completely deny that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Speaking of muscles, we have some that let us wiggle our ears (The auricular/extrinsic muscles). Not many can do it though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many mammals it helps them figure out where a sound is coming from, and it's an important part of body language. But humans have no real use for them, because we turn our head to localize sound and generally don't communicate using our ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. The urinary tract in males passes through (rather than being routed around) the prostate gland, which can swell and block urinary function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. It's also dangerous enough that our balls are literally hanging down there with no protection, meaning they're a vulnerable and easy target to attack. For example monkeys usually go for the genitals when attacking each other, because it's very painful and takes away the privilege to reproduce and dominate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many better choices to place the testicles, including inside the human himself just like how ovaries are inside a woman. This wouldn't be a problem at all for somebody like god, but he made the choice of placing them in a very vulnerable location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not impossible (especially for god) because elephants have their testicles buried deep within their body, next to the kidneys. Maybe if allah did the same for humans, his claim that semen emerges from backbone and ribs (86:5-7) would be more accurate lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&quot;text-24 xs:text-20&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either all of these were results of evolution and natural selection, or allah just really sucks at designing his creations then label them as &quot;perfect&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially when they're so problematic to us and could cause death such as choking, because we're forced to use the same anatomical structure for both ingestion and respiration. But when obstructed, airflow is blocked and it can lead to choking and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more flaws in the human body but these are one of the most prominent, some animals have it way worse than us but I guess in the eyes of allah that's perfect creation with no flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have more to add, please do so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYgra1kLe7E&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; sandbox=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a common practice to wash yourself before prayers in many religions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/ablution&quot;&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/ablution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devout follower of &lt;span id=&quot;ref286708&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;md-crosslink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shinto&quot; data-show-preview=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Shintō&lt;/a&gt;, for example, rinses hands and mouth with water before approaching a shrine. Monks of the &lt;span id=&quot;ref286709&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;md-crosslink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Theravada&quot; data-show-preview=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Theravāda&lt;/a&gt; Buddhist tradition wash themselves in the monastery pool before meditation. The upper-caste Hindu bathes ceremonially in water before performing daily morning worship (&lt;em&gt;pūjā&lt;/em&gt;) in the home. &lt;span id=&quot;ref286710&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Jewish law requires &lt;a class=&quot;md-crosslink autoxref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/ritual&quot; data-show-preview=&quot;true&quot;&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw&quot; href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immersion&quot; data-term=&quot;immersion&quot; data-type=&quot;MW&quot;&gt;immersion&lt;/a&gt; of their whole bodies by women prior to marriage and after menstruation, as well as by new converts to Judaism. Washing of the hands after rising in the morning and before meals that include bread are also examples of ablution in Judaism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muhammad took this practice from Zoroastrians:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoroastrians were also praying 5 times a day, and they also had to do ablution before the prayers, known as PĀDYĀB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;You can read about it here: &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/padyab&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/padyab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad not only copied the concept of 5 times prayers but also of washing before it from Zoroastrians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It is an Over-Kill, which brings other diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washing your hands 5 times a day is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But if you have to wash your hands till elbows and feet too 5 times a day, then it is a waste of water and your time (especially in winter, when your elbows are completely covered in clothes, and feet covered in socks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Many times Muslims also get cold (in winter), as they have to wash their foot, nose and feet 5 times a day with cold water. They don't always have towels with them to dry their faces and feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Many times Muslims get foot fungus (especially in cold areas). It happens while they had to do Wadhu, and then put socks immediately on wet feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, washing the face and putting water in the nose 5 times a day in cold winters is also an over-kill, especially for those who don't have a strong immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, sex life at night in winter is also a nightmare. It was a nightmare as you have to take a full body bath very early in the cold morning, and then go to the Fajr Prayer. It is also a recipe for disaster, especially if you have to go to the office on the motorcycle, after having a bath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;It is even a bigger nightmare for wives, as they have long hair, and it takes half an hour to dry their hair before Fajr prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;(PS: It became even bigger problem when there was no warm water available in winter, or we didn't have enough time to boil water before Fajr prayers. This compelled us to take a bath with cold water)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suggest that Islamic preachers first examine Islam thoroughly before raising objections against others. Let's consider whether Muhammad himself ever read even four books. What about his thousands of companions? Did they even read a single book? In fact, the Jews of that time were likely more educated than Muhammad and his illiterate companions. However, Muhammad justified his lower level of knowledge (and of his companions) by calling Jews &quot;donkeys&quot;, who are only carrying a load of books (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/62.5&quot;&gt;62:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ex-Muslim atheists have often delved into Islam far more extensively than just reading four books. They possess greater knowledge than non-Muslims who convert to Islam. It is essential to address the &lt;strong&gt;double standards&lt;/strong&gt; employed by Muslim preachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They argue that non-Muslims become wise enough to make an informed decision to embrace Islam despite their limited knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the same preachers impose the condition that ex-Muslims must obtain a PhD degree in Islam before criticizing or leaving the religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, if companions and the Quran refer to opponents as &quot;ignorant&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/6.111&quot;&gt;6:111&lt;/a&gt;) or &quot;donkeys&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/62.5&quot;&gt;62:5&lt;/a&gt;), then Muslim preachers have no issue with it and do not view it as an insult. However, when educated ex-Muslim atheists critique Islam, they are labeled as &quot;illiterates,&quot; and their criticism is considered an insult to Islam and blasphemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Yet, the universal truth remains that one does not need to read just four books in order to criticize or leave a religion. Rather, one's &quot;&lt;b&gt;common sense&lt;/b&gt;&quot; and “&lt;b&gt;humanity&lt;/b&gt;” are sufficient to realize that a particular religion may be flawed. Moreover, one also needs “&lt;b&gt;sense of justice&lt;/b&gt;” and a “&lt;b&gt;pure heart&lt;/b&gt;” in order to &lt;b&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/b&gt; the truth. Without a pure heart, one only becomes a blind follower, and even thousands of books cannot help him to accept the Truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, atheists are known for their abundance of common sense. Even their opponents acknowledge that atheists do not trust blindly; they question every claim and employ their rationality to evaluate each one. It is through these rigorous methods that they accept or reject a claim. This ability of &quot;critical thinking&quot; is far more important in order to find the truth, than merely reading four books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is straightforward: One does not require a PhD degree to enter Islam or to criticize or leave it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suggest that Islamic preachers first examine Islam thoroughly before raising objections against others. Let's consider whether Muhammad himself ever read even four books. What about his thousands of companions? Did they even read a single book? In fact, the Jews of that time were likely more educated than Muhammad and his illiterate companions. However, Muhammad justified his lower level of knowledge (and of his companions) by calling Jews &quot;donkeys&quot;, who are only carrying a load of books (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/62.5&quot;&gt;62:5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a top medical journal, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;minor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; marriage and childbirth is very safe throughout the world, far safer than marriage and childbirth after age 29. Existing data indicates that marriage and childbirth at early ages &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #2800ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(e.g., 15-19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is extremely safe. The data suggest that if we want to name and shame cultures for endangering women, we should stigmatize those (liberal) cultures which encourage marriage and childbirth after ages 20-25 - as danger to women rapidly increases after this age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/images/daniel_minor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Danial: 15 to 20 years old MINOR girls&quot; width=&quot;473&quot; height=&quot;522&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/daniel_minor.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Answer: It is not about being a &quot;minor&quot;, but about the &quot;age of consent&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear People, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please understand that the religion of Islam works as a cult, where its followers are very easily manipulated and deceived by Islamic preachers like Daniel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel is very clearly deceiving them by calling 15 to 20 years old girls &quot;&lt;strong&gt;minors&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; in this matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term of &quot;minor&quot; in the world is used for LEGAL issues (like drinking, driving licence, crimes etc.). And it is 18 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, the issue is about the &quot;marriage&quot;, and it is not about being a minor, but it is about the &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;age of consent&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;And this &quot;age of consent&quot; in Europe and almost all over the world is 16 years&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/ages-of-consent-around-world-countries-laws-japan-sexual-abuse-b1061907.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, his Muslim followers are not in a position to figure out this deception, while religion makes people often blind. This is the main reason why religions are so successful in brainwashing their followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam allows men to marry minor girls, and penetration in their vaginas starts at the age of 8 or 9 years or even earlier if they think that the prepubescent girl is strong enough to bear the pain of penetration. Nevertheless, men (neither the father of the girl nor the husband nor any medical doctor) are in a position to find out if an 8 or 9 or 10  years old girl is ready for penetration. This results often in the painful suffering of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula#:~:text=A%20vaginal%20fistula%20is%20an,and%20other%20irritative%20type%20symptoms.&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viginal Fistula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among girls (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vaginal fistula is an abnormal opening between the vagina and other nearby organs in the pelvis, including the bladder or rectum. A fistula can cause many complications, such as urinary and fecal leakage, abnormal vaginal discharge, tissue damage, kidney infections and other irritative type symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his promotion of minor marriage, Daniel promotes impregnating 9 or 10 year olds to &quot;extend the fertility window&quot;, through the practice of marriage to an old man marrying, or having sex with 9 years old prepubescent girls. He calls it to be a tradition (Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Youtube Video of Daniel Haqiqatjou&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Daniel really wants to defend the Sharia Ruling of having sex with minor girls, then he should bring a scientific study which deals with girls from 9 years and onwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, this study of 15 to 19 years old girls (which Daniel mentioned) is also not showing accurate results. We know that in almost all countries of the world, marriage is legal only after 18 years. Thus, most of the girls in this group of 15-19 years are actually getting married at the age of 18 or 19 years, while some of them may be between 16 to 17 years too, but there are only a few who marry at the age of 15 and get babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childbirth is still dangerous at the age of 15 years, as it becomes clear from other studies. For example, look at the following study: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;. ......girls aged &lt;span style=&quot;color: #2800ff;&quot;&gt;15 or under&lt;/span&gt; had an odds ratio for maternal death &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;four times higher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Vaginal Fistula, please read this study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, the high mortality rate among children from teen mothers is not the only problem, but they suffer from other horrific health problems too, the whole of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Child&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children of teen mothers are at higher risk of intellectual, language, and socio-emotional delays.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Day_2009_30-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Day_2009-30&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Developmental disability&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability&quot;&gt;Developmental disabilities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Behavior&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior&quot;&gt;behavioral&lt;/a&gt; issues are increased in children born to teen mothers.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-34&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-34&quot;&gt;[34]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One study suggested that adolescent mothers are less likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Stimulation&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation&quot;&gt;stimulate&lt;/a&gt; their infant through &lt;a title=&quot;Affection&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection&quot;&gt;affectionate behaviors&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a title=&quot;Haptic communication&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_communication&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Smile&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile&quot;&gt;smiling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&quot;Linguistics&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics&quot;&gt;verbal communication&lt;/a&gt;, or to be &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sensitivity (human)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_(human)&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Acceptance&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance&quot;&gt;accepting&lt;/a&gt; toward their needs.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Grade (education)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)&quot;&gt;academic performance&lt;/a&gt; in the children of teenage mothers has also been noted, with many of the children being held back a grade level, scoring lower on standardized tests, and/or failing to graduate from secondary school.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-natcamp_26-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-natcamp-26&quot;&gt;[26]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Sentence (law)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)&quot;&gt;serve time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title=&quot;Prison&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-37&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-37&quot;&gt;[37]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is all this Data Islamophobic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in the Western world don't hesitate to get children after the age of 29, while medical facilities have made childbirth safer even after 29 years. It is reflected in the chart itself, that Daniel presented. The link to the direct scientific study is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307723764_Maternal_mortality_in_adolescents_compared_with_women_of_other_ages_evidence_from_144_countries&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;h2&gt;Answer: It is not about being a &quot;minor&quot;, but about the &quot;age of consent&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;And this &quot;age of consent&quot; in Europe and almost all over the world is 16 years&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/ages-of-consent-around-world-countries-laws-japan-sexual-abuse-b1061907.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless, men (neither the father of the girl nor the husband nor any medical doctor) are in a position to find out if an 8 or 9 or 10  years old girl is ready for penetration. This results often in the painful suffering of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula#:~:text=A%20vaginal%20fistula%20is%20an,and%20other%20irritative%20type%20symptoms.&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viginal Fistula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among girls (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

He calls it to be a tradition (Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Youtube Video of Daniel Haqiqatjou&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Daniel really wants to defend the Sharia Ruling of having sex with minor girls, then he should bring a scientific study which deals with girls from 9 years and onwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, this study of 15 to 19 years old girls (which Daniel mentioned) is also not showing accurate results. We know that in almost all countries of the world, marriage is legal only after 18 years. Thus, most of the girls in this group of 15-19 years are actually getting married at the age of 18 or 19 years, while some of them may be between 16 to 17 years too, but there are only a few who marry at the age of 15 and get babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childbirth is still dangerous at the age of 15 years, as it becomes clear from other studies. For example, look at the following study: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;. ......girls aged &lt;span style=&quot;color: #2800ff;&quot;&gt;15 or under&lt;/span&gt; had an odds ratio for maternal death &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;four times higher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Vaginal Fistula, please read this study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, the high mortality rate among children from teen mothers is not the only problem, but they suffer from other horrific health problems too, the whole of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Child&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children of teen mothers are at higher risk of intellectual, language, and socio-emotional delays.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Day_2009_30-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Day_2009-30&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Developmental disability&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability&quot;&gt;Developmental disabilities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Behavior&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior&quot;&gt;behavioral&lt;/a&gt; issues are increased in children born to teen mothers.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-34&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-34&quot;&gt;[34]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One study suggested that adolescent mothers are less likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Stimulation&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation&quot;&gt;stimulate&lt;/a&gt; their infant through &lt;a title=&quot;Affection&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection&quot;&gt;affectionate behaviors&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a title=&quot;Haptic communication&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_communication&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Smile&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile&quot;&gt;smiling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&quot;Linguistics&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics&quot;&gt;verbal communication&lt;/a&gt;, or to be &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sensitivity (human)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_(human)&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Acceptance&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance&quot;&gt;accepting&lt;/a&gt; toward their needs.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Grade (education)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)&quot;&gt;academic performance&lt;/a&gt; in the children of teenage mothers has also been noted, with many of the children being held back a grade level, scoring lower on standardized tests, and/or failing to graduate from secondary school.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-natcamp_26-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-natcamp-26&quot;&gt;[26]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Sentence (law)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)&quot;&gt;serve time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title=&quot;Prison&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-37&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-37&quot;&gt;[37]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is all this Data Islamophobic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in the Western world don't hesitate to get children after the age of 29, while medical facilities have made childbirth safer even after 29 years. It is reflected in the chart itself, that Daniel presented. The link to the direct scientific study is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307723764_Maternal_mortality_in_adolescents_compared_with_women_of_other_ages_evidence_from_144_countries&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Even a blind man can also see that 1400 years old system of Islam is unjust, unlogical, against humanity, and in no way it can logically compete with the modern secular system. But still a huge majority of Muslims demand to abolish the secular system and impose the Islamic Sharia system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this demand is not made only by non-educated Muslims, but the educated Muslims of countries like Malaysia and Indonesia also demand an Islamic Sharia system. Even Turkey is going in the opposite direction of a secular system under Erdogan, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to talk about Islamic countries, the secular system even got defeated among the Muslim communities in Western secular countries too. And these Muslim communities are not integrating into the local secular communities, but they are moving towards radical Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Important Question: What is the reason for this defeat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have to describe the reason for this defeat in very simple words, then it is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;The Concept of God&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, which supports the Islamic Sharia system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam brainwashes its followers by telling them that Allah is &lt;strong&gt;All-Wise&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;All-Knowledgeable&lt;/strong&gt;, and cannot be challenged in any way. Thus, even if Allah's commands appear to be unjust and oppressive to human intellect, still they are the best for mankind while Human intellect cannot comprehend Allah's wisdom and knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, once a Muslim is brainwashed into believing this logic, then he also accepts all illogical and flawed commands of Allah and rejects the principles of a secular system, which are based on justice, humanity, and virtues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: How then it will become possible to implement a secular system in Islamic countries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is, it is absolutely not enough to raise voices &quot;only&quot; for a secular system in Islamic countries, but it also needs the support of Atheism/Agnosticism (i.e. of non-religionism which consists of Atheism, Agnosticism and also Deism). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there is absolutely no criticism present of the &quot;concept of Allah&quot;. Therefore, secularism &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; has to compete with the combination of &lt;strong&gt;the Islamic System&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;the concept of Allah&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the main reason why secularism got defeated in Islamic countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voices which demand secularism in Islamic countries are already present there for many decades. Nevertheless, the Atheist movement just got started during the last one or two decades after the arrival of the internet and social media. It is still in its infancy, and gradually getting organised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;And when secularism and atheism come together in opposition to the &quot;concept of Allah&quot; and the &quot;Islamic system,&quot; then in that battle, the fate of Islam and the Islamic system will be defeat and death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation at the moment is as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe is the centre of secularism, but still a lot of people are converting to Islam in this centre itself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But on the other hand, the Atheist Movement is also getting organised and stronger in the West gradually. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible that a &quot;secular European&quot; may convert to Islam, but it is almost impossible that any &quot;atheist European&quot; can ever convert to Islam after believing in science and the theory of evolution. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;That is why, the rate of conversion of &quot;atheist European&quot; to Islam is already zero.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;But the opposite is not true. There are already thousands of Muslims who are leaving Islam and becoming atheists. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson is clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radical Muslims don't fear secularism. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But they are absolutely worried and fearful of Atheism/Agnosticism. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever secularism and atheism come together, then they will demolish the Islamic system and the concept of Allah, which were made by Muhammad. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: How secular system succeeded in defeating religion the religious system in Europe without Atheism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the majority of Europe was not atheist, still it succeeded in implementing a secular system. So, why was the atheist movement not needed in Europe, but it is needed in Islamic countries in order to attract Muslim masses towards secularism? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atheist movement was indeed present in Europe during the previous centuries. And freedom to criticize religion (Christianity) was also present in Europe during the previous centuries. Due to this criticism, even if the majority of Europeans didn't become open atheists, but they still became less and less religious, which ultimately resulted in becoming secularists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Islamic countries today, there exists absolutely no freedom of speech against Islam. Moreover, whenever Islam is criticized, then they practice draconian blasphemy laws and mob lynchings and kill people. Due to this, Muslims are &quot;&lt;strong&gt;highly religious&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; today, and thus they are not moving towards secularism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was (and still) a great mistake of the West, where they give a lot of importance to &quot;democracy&quot;, but they let Islamic countries to introduce blasphemy laws and kill any criticism of Islam. A democracy without true secularism is nothing else than the &quot;dictatorship of the majority&quot;. And in Islamic countries, the majority of Muslims imposed the dictatorship of Sharia laws, which don't give &quot;equal&quot; human rights to non-Muslims. In simple words, Islamic Sharia is nothing else than &quot;dictatorship&quot; itself against non-Muslim minorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if we want Islamic countries to become secular, then blasphemy laws should come to an end, and criticism of Islam should become possible. As soon as open criticism of Islam becomes possible, then millions of Muslims will either leave Islam or at least become secularists. From inside, there are already millions of Muslims present who are not SATISFIED with Islam. Only if they can get open access to criticism of Islam, then they will too rebel against Islam as Europeans rebelled against Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the internet and social media are providing only limited chances to bring criticism of Islam to the Muslim masses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Islamic Democracies, they go for an &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Islamic System&lt;/strong&gt; instead of a &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Secular System&lt;/strong&gt;, which turns these Islamic democracies into the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Dictatorship of Majority&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. And the minorities become 2nd or 3rd class citizens in such Islamic democracies, losing many of their basic and &lt;strong&gt;EQUAL&lt;/strong&gt; human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, in Islamic democracies, governments are always very weak and never have the power to go against Islamic law. They have to appease their voter bank instead of doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, dictators like Muhammad bin Salman (Saudi Arabia) indeed went against Islamic laws, and he was able to abolish a few draconian Sharia laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second Example:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Not only Islamic countries, but radical Hindus also succeeded in turning Indian Democracy into the &quot;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Dictatorship of the Majority&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And to be honest, in the USA too under Trump and some of his far-right supporters, it saw as the &quot;Dictatorship of the Majority&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Right-Wing Netanyahu in Israel is also moving in the same direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Erdogan made democracy a joke in Turkey, and it has become a dictatorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Democracy in Russia under Putin is also like a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;That is why, a democracy without true secular values, has no value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 2: &lt;/strong&gt;Democracy only works with a left-wing electorate, because right-wingers don't believe in democracy. When right-wingers win elections, the first thing they do is try to dismantle democracy, in truth if not in name. That's not an insult, it's the literal definition of right-wing vs left-wing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;If the woman is outside of the home you have to Outsource things like upbringing of children modern model of life children being shipped off to this institution of schooling in general this fundamentally creates problems for the family structure because people are spending most of their time with strangers and when you do that family bonds weaken people tend to have more of a connection and loyalty and love towards people that they spend more of their time with.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Women should do whatever they want and whatever they have to do. Meaning if she can and wants to be a stay at home mom, go for it. If she wants to work or have to work then no problem. That's not going to affect the child/children negatively whatsoever:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017018760167#.WwxcIdoRW9Q.twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;There are countless benefits to being raised by working educated women (Scientific Study)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;What is most critical for her to do is to prioritise motherhood for the first 2-3years. This includes the father! The mother should stay with the child as much as physically possible during this time. Her job should give her atleast 1-2 years off and 1-2 years part time/modified. After this, this prioritisation should continue in a more structured/scheduled fashion until the kid grows up. The mother shouldn't have to stay at home! That's bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;irstly,&lt;/strong&gt; men also go to work. Does it break the bond between fathers and children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly,&lt;/strong&gt; Muslim men had 4 wives and dozens of slave women for sex purposes, and then dozens of children from them. They saw their children after long periods of time. Did that break the bond between them and their children? If not, how the mother/child bond is going to break if the mother goes to work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thirdly&lt;/strong&gt;, 80% of female doctors in Pakistan don't practise it after getting married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, a significant number of female doctors discontinue practicing medicine after marriage. According to Dr. Khalid Masood Gondal, Vice Chancellor of King Edward Medical University, approximately 80% of medical graduates are women, but only 20% of them continue to serve as doctors after marriage, while the remaining 60% leave the profession. &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

&lt;p&gt;This trend is attributed to societal expectations and familial responsibilities that prioritize domestic roles for women over professional careers. Many female doctors face pressure from family members or in-laws to focus on household duties, leading them to abandon their medical practice. &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourthly&lt;/strong&gt;, Islam broke the families of male and female slaves. Islam has the evil of “&lt;strong&gt;Slavery by Birth&lt;/strong&gt;”. And when a baby has 2 teeth (6 to 8 months), then the owner can separate the baby and sell the child or slave mother, or both in the Islam Bazaars of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book Risala:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Alvi Nastaleeq;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;ur-PK&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arabic Typesetting, cursive;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;A slave-mother and her baby could not be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) till the baby has his second tooth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;As far as the father (i.e. male slave) is concerned, then he can be sold by the owner whenever he wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Allah/Muhammad also allowed the master to snatch away the wife of his slave, and to start raping her, thus destroying the whole slave family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. There is no harm in a man (i.e the owner) taking his female slave (for himself) from his male slave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;irstly,&lt;/strong&gt; men also go to work. Does it break the bond between fathers and children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly,&lt;/strong&gt; Muslim men had 4 wives and dozens of slave women for sex purposes, and then dozens of children from them. They saw their children after long periods of time. Did that break the bond between them and their children? If not, how the mother/child bond is going to break if the mother goes to work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thirdly&lt;/strong&gt;, 80% of female doctors in Pakistan don't practise it after getting married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, a significant number of female doctors discontinue practicing medicine after marriage. According to Dr. Khalid Masood Gondal, Vice Chancellor of King Edward Medical University, approximately 80% of medical graduates are women, but only 20% of them continue to serve as doctors after marriage, while the remaining 60% leave the profession. &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

&lt;p&gt;This trend is attributed to societal expectations and familial responsibilities that prioritize domestic roles for women over professional careers. Many female doctors face pressure from family members or in-laws to focus on household duties, leading them to abandon their medical practice. &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourthly&lt;/strong&gt;, Islam broke the families of male and female slaves. Islam has the evil of “&lt;strong&gt;Slavery by Birth&lt;/strong&gt;”. And when a baby has 2 teeth (6 to 8 months), then the owner can separate the baby and sell the child or slave mother, or both in the Islam Bazaars of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book Risala:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Alvi Nastaleeq;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;ur-PK&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arabic Typesetting, cursive;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;A slave-mother and her baby could not be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) till the baby has his second tooth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;As far as the father (i.e. male slave) is concerned, then he can be sold by the owner whenever he wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Allah/Muhammad also allowed the master to snatch away the wife of his slave, and to start raping her, thus destroying the whole slave family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5105/&quot; rel=&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot; data-ve-attributes=&quot;{&amp;quot;rel&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;mw:ExtLink&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 5105:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. There is no harm in a man (i.e the owner) taking his female slave (for himself) from his male slave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;560&quot; title=&quot;What is the contribution of Atheists to science in history?&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zs-EBE0dcpM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; sandbox=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed atheism (a non-religious system) provides an OPTIMAL environment for scientific progress. But before moving to atheism and how it supports science, first, let's examine the relationship between Islam and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Harms that Islam Inflicted upon Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islam made the whole Islamic world get religious education. As a result, Islam produced millions of Islamic Scholars in the last 1400 years, who were involved only in Jurisprudence and Sectarian fights. Compared to those millions of Islamic Scholars, Islam could not produce even a handful of scientists in 1400 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And you will not see even a single woman in the list of those earlier Muslim scientists of the last 1400 years, while Islam considers women to be deficient in intelligence, and they had to stay at home in the name of &quot;Islamic Modesty&quot;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, the prohibition of studying human anatomy by Islam, in the name of &quot;respect&quot; for the deceased hindered medical progress for centuries, impeding critical advancements in the medical field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then some Islamic Rulers also made life difficult for many Muslim scientists too due to their sects or atheist leanings. Ibn Sina was hiding his whole life, and he had to write his books in this state of hiding. Al-Razi was hit in his head by his own books in the mosque. Ibn-e-Rushd got the punishment for being an atheist. Yaqub al-Kindi lashed in public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contemporary times, schools in many Muslim countries continue to teach that Darwin's Theory of Evolution is incorrect, promoting the belief that humans were directly created by Allah and that Allah directly sent humans to the earth after a woman from the crooked rib of a man deceived him to eat the forbidden apple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A challenge to Muslims to show that Muslim Scientists ever extracted any scientific discovery from the Quran or Hadith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of the earlier Muslim scientists ever claimed to derive scientific discoveries directly from the Quran or Hadith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muslims were initially introduced to Greek/Roman scientific works through their conquests in Egypt and other regions. Later, Abbasid Caliph Mamun (d. 213 Hijri year) ordered the translation of these works into Arabic. Only after this development did Muslim scientists begin to emerge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muslims assert that the Sahaba (companions) of Muhammad were the best of Muslim generations. However, despite reading the Quran and Hadith throughout their lives, the Sahaba and the subsequent 5 to 10 Muslim generations were unable to extract any scientific knowledge from the Quran and the Hadith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present-day Muslims also struggle to extract scientific discoveries directly from the Quran/Hadith, often relying on science to make new findings before connecting them to the Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div data-reddit-rtjson=&quot;{&amp;quot;entityMap&amp;quot;:{},&amp;quot;blocks&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;key&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;a55p1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Thus, the CREDIT of early Muslim scientists and the \&amp;quot;Islamic Golden Age of Science\&amp;quot; does not go to the Quran or Hadith, but to the translated scientific work of Greek/Roman scientists, to those Muslim scientists as individuals, and to Muslim rulers of that time who supported the scientific work. &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;unstyled&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;inlineStyleRanges&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;offset&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;length&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;style&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;BOLD&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;offset&amp;quot;:53,&amp;quot;length&amp;quot;:29,&amp;quot;style&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;BOLD&amp;quot;}],&amp;quot;entityRanges&amp;quot;:[],&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;:{}}]}&quot;&gt;Thus, the &lt;strong&gt;CREDIT&lt;/strong&gt; for the accomplishments of early Muslim scientists and the &quot;Islamic Golden Age of Science&quot; does not belong to the Quran or Hadith, but rather to the translated scientific works of Greek and Roman scientists, to individual Muslim scientists, and to Muslim rulers of the time who supported scientific endeavors.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;97% of the Scientific Community supports Evolution and rejects the theory of Creation today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn't an organized atheist movement advocating for atheism during the past few centuries. Despite this, a vast majority of the scientific community today, estimated to be around 97%, supports the theory of evolution and rejects the idea of creationism and the story of Adam and Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all (around 97%) of the scientific community accepts evolution as the dominant scientific theory of biological diversity, with 87% accepting that evolution occurs due to natural processes, such as &lt;a title=&quot;Natural selection&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection&quot;&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-pew_1-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-pew-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Scientific associations have strongly rebutted and refuted the challenges to evolution proposed by &lt;a title=&quot;Intelligent design&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design&quot;&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; proponents.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-dover_pg83_3-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-dover_pg83-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ... The vast majority of the &lt;a title=&quot;Scientific community&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_community&quot;&gt;scientific community&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Academia&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia&quot;&gt;academia&lt;/a&gt; supports evolutionary theory as the only explanation that can fully account for observations in the fields of &lt;a title=&quot;Biology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology&quot;&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Paleontology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology&quot;&gt;palaeontology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Molecular biology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology&quot;&gt;molecular biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Genetics&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics&quot;&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Anthropology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology&quot;&gt;anthropology&lt;/a&gt;, and others.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-18&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-18&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-19&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-19&quot;&gt;[19]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-20&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-20&quot;&gt;[20]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-AAAS_Denounces_Anti-Evolution_Laws_21-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-AAAS_Denounces_Anti-Evolution_Laws-21&quot;&gt;[21]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-factfancy_22-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-factfancy-22&quot;&gt;[22]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A 1991 Gallup poll found that about 5% of American scientists (including those with training outside biology) identified themselves as creationists.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-robinson_23-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-robinson-23&quot;&gt;[23]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-24&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-24&quot;&gt;[24]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple words, today the fathers of Physics, Chemistry, Biology etc., who are making scientific discoveries, are almost all ATHEISTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is FACTUALLY WRONG. There have been hundreds of atheist scientists some founders of new branches of science: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_atheists_in_science_and_technology&quot;&gt;List of Atheists in Science &amp;amp; Technology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, look at how atheists faced hardships in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_atheists&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_atheists&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There were &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_the_United_Kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;laws on the books&lt;/a&gt; against atheism. In continental Europe, &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Dolet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;atheism was punishable by death&lt;/a&gt;. The death penalty for atheism was only abolished in the &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_Jurisdiction_Act_1677&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;United Kingdom in 1677&lt;/a&gt;. Virtually all institutions of higher learning prior to the late 1800s were religious. In the United Kingdom, you could not attend Cambridge and Oxford unless you subscribed to the 39 Articles of the Church of England, a practice that was only &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Tests_Act_1871&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;abolished in 1871&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, these men weren't Christians because of choice, but because there was no other alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Therefore, the reason &quot;Many great scientists believed in god in the past!&quot; was because prior to the late 1800s, you had to openly profess belief in god or risk imprisonment and death for being an atheist. It was only during the second half of the 19th century that atheism became a respectable position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Atheists don't have any MONOPOLY upon science. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But Atheism naturally promotes freethinking and thus supports scientific progress in an OPTIMAL way. While compared to Atheism, religious systems don't optimally support science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam produced millions of Scholars of Jurisprudence and the Quran/Hadith, but only a handful of scientists during the last 14 centuries. But when the non-religious system became stronger in Europe, then look at how science was supported and it progressed at a rapid pace. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam failed to produce even a handful of female scientists during 1400 years. But look how the non-religious system supported women and today universities are producing thousands of female scientists every year. Even today, if a few Muslim women are becoming scientists, then it is not due to Islam, but due to the reason that the present non-religious system even promotes and supports Muslim women too to become scientists. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And look, even Galileo was religious, but his heliocentric discoveries were suppressed by the church, delaying technological progress. In the case of a clash between religion and science, religion killed scientific discoveries or slowed down their progress. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Religions showed us 1000s of years of scientific dark age/stagnation. Whatever progress we saw was sporadic or because of a few benevolent and curious rulers, who funded scholars. However, a few centuries of secularism and separation of church and state has given us an exponential amount of technological growth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, the Muslim preacher takes credit for scientists being theists, but in the same way, will he take the blame for all those massacres done by theists? Probably no. He will be the first one to say terrorism has no religion.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed atheism (a non-religious system) provides an OPTIMAL environment for scientific progress. But before moving to atheism and how it supports science, first, let's examine the relationship between Islam and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Harms that Islam Inflicted upon Science&lt;/h2&gt;

Ibn Sina was hiding his whole life, and he had to write his books in this state of hiding. Al-Razi was hit in his head by his own books in the mosque. Ibn-e-Rushd got the punishment for being an atheist. Yaqub al-Kindi lashed in public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contemporary times, schools in many Muslim countries continue to teach that Darwin's Theory of Evolution is incorrect, promoting the belief that humans were directly created by Allah and that Allah directly sent humans to the earth after a woman from the crooked rib of a man deceived him to eat the forbidden apple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A challenge to Muslims to show that Muslim Scientists ever extracted any scientific discovery from the Quran or Hadith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of the earlier Muslim scientists ever claimed to derive scientific discoveries directly from the Quran or Hadith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muslims were initially introduced to Greek/Roman scientific works through their conquests in Egypt and other regions. Later, Abbasid Caliph Mamun (d. 213 Hijri year) ordered the translation of these works into Arabic. Only after this development did Muslim scientists begin to emerge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muslims assert that the Sahaba (companions) of Muhammad were the best of Muslim generations. However, despite reading the Quran and Hadith throughout their lives, the Sahaba and the subsequent 5 to 10 Muslim generations were unable to extract any scientific knowledge from the Quran and the Hadith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present-day Muslims also struggle to extract scientific discoveries directly from the Quran/Hadith, often relying on science to make new findings before connecting them to the Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div data-reddit-rtjson=&quot;{&amp;quot;entityMap&amp;quot;:{},&amp;quot;blocks&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;key&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;a55p1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Thus, the CREDIT of early Muslim scientists and the \&amp;quot;Islamic Golden Age of Science\&amp;quot; does not go to the Quran or Hadith, but to the translated scientific work of Greek/Roman scientists, to those Muslim scientists as individuals, and to Muslim rulers of that time who supported the scientific work. &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;unstyled&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;inlineStyleRanges&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;offset&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;length&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;style&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;BOLD&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;offset&amp;quot;:53,&amp;quot;length&amp;quot;:29,&amp;quot;style&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;BOLD&amp;quot;}],&amp;quot;entityRanges&amp;quot;:[],&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;:{}}]}&quot;&gt;Thus, the &lt;strong&gt;CREDIT&lt;/strong&gt; for the accomplishments of early Muslim scientists and the &quot;Islamic Golden Age of Science&quot; does not belong to the Quran or Hadith, but rather to the translated scientific works of Greek and Roman scientists, to individual Muslim scientists, and to Muslim rulers of the time who supported scientific endeavors.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;97% of the Scientific Community supports Evolution and rejects the theory of Creation today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn't an organized atheist movement advocating for atheism during the past few centuries. Despite this, a vast majority of the scientific community today, estimated to be around 97%, supports the theory of evolution and rejects the idea of creationism and the story of Adam and Eve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all (around 97%) of the scientific community accepts evolution as the dominant scientific theory of biological diversity, with 87% accepting that evolution occurs due to natural processes, such as &lt;a title=&quot;Natural selection&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection&quot;&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-pew_1-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-pew-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Scientific associations have strongly rebutted and refuted the challenges to evolution proposed by &lt;a title=&quot;Intelligent design&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design&quot;&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; proponents.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-dover_pg83_3-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-dover_pg83-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ... The vast majority of the &lt;a title=&quot;Scientific community&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_community&quot;&gt;scientific community&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Academia&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia&quot;&gt;academia&lt;/a&gt; supports evolutionary theory as the only explanation that can fully account for observations in the fields of &lt;a title=&quot;Biology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology&quot;&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Paleontology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology&quot;&gt;palaeontology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Molecular biology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology&quot;&gt;molecular biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Genetics&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics&quot;&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Anthropology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology&quot;&gt;anthropology&lt;/a&gt;, and others.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-18&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-18&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-19&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-19&quot;&gt;[19]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-20&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-20&quot;&gt;[20]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-AAAS_Denounces_Anti-Evolution_Laws_21-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-AAAS_Denounces_Anti-Evolution_Laws-21&quot;&gt;[21]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-factfancy_22-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-factfancy-22&quot;&gt;[22]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A 1991 Gallup poll found that about 5% of American scientists (including those with training outside biology) identified themselves as creationists.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-robinson_23-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-robinson-23&quot;&gt;[23]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-24&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#cite_note-24&quot;&gt;[24]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple words, today the fathers of Physics, Chemistry, Biology etc., who are making scientific discoveries, are almost all ATHEISTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is FACTUALLY WRONG. There have been hundreds of atheist scientists some founders of new branches of science: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_atheists_in_science_and_technology&quot;&gt;List of Atheists in Science &amp;amp; Technology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, look at how atheists faced hardships in the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_atheists&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_against_atheists&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There were &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_the_United_Kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;laws on the books&lt;/a&gt; against atheism. In continental Europe, &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Dolet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;atheism was punishable by death&lt;/a&gt;. The death penalty for atheism was only abolished in the &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_Jurisdiction_Act_1677&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;United Kingdom in 1677&lt;/a&gt;. Virtually all institutions of higher learning prior to the late 1800s were religious. In the United Kingdom, you could not attend Cambridge and Oxford unless you subscribed to the 39 Articles of the Church of England, a practice that was only &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Tests_Act_1871&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;abolished in 1871&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, these men weren't Christians because of choice, but because there was no other alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Therefore, the reason &quot;Many great scientists believed in god in the past!&quot; was because prior to the late 1800s, you had to openly profess belief in god or risk imprisonment and death for being an atheist. It was only during the second half of the 19th century that atheism became a respectable position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Atheists don't have any MONOPOLY upon science. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But Atheism naturally promotes freethinking and thus supports scientific progress in an OPTIMAL way. While compared to Atheism, religious systems don't optimally support science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam produced millions of Scholars of Jurisprudence and the Quran/Hadith, but only a handful of scientists during the last 14 centuries. But when the non-religious system became stronger in Europe, then look at how science was supported and it progressed at a rapid pace. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam failed to produce even a handful of female scientists during 1400 years. But look how the non-religious system supported women and today universities are producing thousands of female scientists every year. Even today, if a few Muslim women are becoming scientists, then it is not due to Islam, but due to the reason that the present non-religious system even promotes and supports Muslim women too to become scientists. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And look, even Galileo was religious, but his heliocentric discoveries were suppressed by the church, delaying technological progress. In the case of a clash between religion and science, religion killed scientific discoveries or slowed down their progress. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Religions showed us 1000s of years of scientific dark age/stagnation. Whatever progress we saw was sporadic or because of a few benevolent and curious rulers, who funded scholars. However, a few centuries of secularism and separation of church and state has given us an exponential amount of technological growth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, the Muslim preacher takes credit for scientists being theists, but in the same way, will he take the blame for all those massacres done by theists? Probably no. He will be the first one to say terrorism has no religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

An analysis of Zakir Naik's arguments&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIECUxsUPMI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; sandbox=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please listen to this video at 10:05, where Zakir Naik is telling that 80% of this Quran is matching 100% with science, while the rest 20% is &lt;strong&gt;AMBIGUOUS&lt;/strong&gt;, neither right nor wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we tell Zakir Naik and Muslims that&lt;strong&gt; the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% ambiguous Quran means that the rest 80% building of Islam is automatically going to collapse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Please look at the claim of the Quran that its verses are CLEAR, and made EASY to understand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.17&quot;&gt;Quran 54:17:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ولقد يسرنا القرآن للذكر فهل من مدكر&lt;br&gt;We have made the Quran easy to understand, but is there anyone who would pay attention?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then this same verse has been repeated multiple times in the Quran (Verses &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/53.22&quot;&gt;53:22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/53.32&quot;&gt;53:32&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/53.40&quot;&gt;53:40&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the Quran claims that its verses are CLEAR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.1&quot;&gt;27:1&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; تِلْكَ آيَاتُ الْقُرْآنِ وَكِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ &lt;br&gt;These are the verse of the Koran and a Clear/Manifest Book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the Quran claims that it was revealed in Arabic language, so then people can understand it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/12.2&quot;&gt;12:2&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ&lt;br&gt;We have revealed it in the Arabic language so that you  would understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So, what is the benefit of revealing it in the Arabic language, when 20% is still ambiguous for Arabic speakers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Therefore, as soon as Muslims will claim that 20% of the Quran is ambiguous, then the Quran will automatically become a liar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Moreover, Zakir Naik's claim that 80% of the Quran matches 100% of science, is also wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There was nothing scientific in the Quran, which was not known by the people of that time. Ancient Roman and Greek scientists told many things about science before Islam. And that scientific stories also reached Syria and other Arab areas through traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And Muhammad only copied those old scientific stories in the Quran. Therefore, there is not a single scientific miracle present in the Quran which was not known to the people of that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In fact, there were many things in those scientific stories, which were wrong. And Muhammad also copied those wrong scientific things in the Quran too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Muslim apologists come up with an excuse that Muhammad was illiterate, and thus he was not able to read and copy those scientific stories. But this excuse has no weight, while Muhammad was not &lt;strong&gt;DEAF.&lt;/strong&gt; He was indeed able to HEAR those scientific stories, and then tell them to others to write them down in the Quran. Arab people of that era had extraordinary memory, and they were able to memorize large poems word by word, although most of them were totally illiterate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An excuse by Muslim apologist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A Muslim apologist came up with this excuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ex-Muslims are taking wrong meaning out of that 20% claim. It only meant that modern science is still limited, and thus it is not able to understand the rest 20% of science that is present in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And we tell them that it is not the case. Science has already reached to that level where it completely refutes all the so-called Quranic miracles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Quran claims that humans are born from gushing &lt;em&gt;water&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. sperm), which comes from between the &lt;em&gt;backbone&lt;/em&gt; and the ribs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But science is already in a position to completely refute this Quranic claim. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And it tells that the gushing water (i.e. the sperms) doesn't come out between the backbone and the ribs, but they are produced and come out of the testicles (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Semen_Production_in_the_Quran&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, modern Islam apologists don't claim that modern science is wrong about testicles. But they come up with excuses that the Quranic verse didn't mean that, but it meant that and that and that (i.e. several meanings). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when they come up with several new (and again mutually contradictory) meanings of the Quranic verse, then it proves only that the verses of the Quran are neither clear nor easy to understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In fact, there were many things in those scientific stories, which were wrong. And Muhammad also copied those wrong scientific things in the Quran too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Muslim apologists come up with an excuse that Muhammad was illiterate, and thus he was not able to read and copy those scientific stories. But this excuse has no weight, while Muhammad was not &lt;strong&gt;DEAF.&lt;/strong&gt; He was indeed able to HEAR those scientific stories, and then tell them to others to write them down in the Quran. Arab people of that era had extraordinary memory, and they were able to memorize large poems word by word, although most of them were totally illiterate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An excuse by Muslim apologist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A Muslim apologist came up with this excuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ex-Muslims are taking wrong meaning out of that 20% claim. It only meant that modern science is still limited, and thus it is not able to understand the rest 20% of science that is present in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And we tell them that it is not the case. Science has already reached to that level where it completely refutes all the so-called Quranic miracles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Quran claims that humans are born from gushing &lt;em&gt;water&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. sperm), which comes from between the &lt;em&gt;backbone&lt;/em&gt; and the ribs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But science is already in a position to completely refute this Quranic claim. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And it tells that the gushing water (i.e. the sperms) doesn't come out between the backbone and the ribs, but they are produced and come out of the testicles (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Semen_Production_in_the_Quran&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, modern Islam apologists don't claim that modern science is wrong about testicles. But they come up with excuses that the Quranic verse didn't mean that, but it meant that and that and that (i.e. several meanings). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when they come up with several new (and again mutually contradictory) meanings of the Quranic verse, then it proves only that the verses of the Quran are neither clear nor easy to understand. &lt;/p&gt;

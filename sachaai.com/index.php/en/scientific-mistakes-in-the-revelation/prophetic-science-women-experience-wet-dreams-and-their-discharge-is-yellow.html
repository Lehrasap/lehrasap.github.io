        <p><span>Let's examine this strange prophetic science in the hadith, where Muhammad claims that women experience wet dreams from dreaming, that the ritual bath (ghusl) is obligatory, and that a woman's semen is thin and yellow.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/3/32">Sahih Muslim 311</a> and <a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/3/72">Sahih al-Bukhari 130</a>:</span></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Anas b. Malik reported that Umm Sulaim narrated it that she asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about a woman who sees in a dream what a man sees (sexual dream). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon bi m) said: In case a woman sees that, she must take a bath. Umm Sulaim said: I was bashful on account of that and said: Does it happen (i.e. if a woman also get nocturnal sexual discharge in dreams like men)? Upon this the Messenger of Allah said: Yes (it does happen), otherwise how can (a child) resemble her? Man's discharge (i. e. sperm) is thick and white and the discharge of woman is thin and yellow; so the resemblance comes from the one whose genes prevail or dominate.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Umm Sulaim (the woman) tried to correct Muhammad (i.e. women don't get any wet dreams like men do), but Muhammad didn't listen to her testimony and didn't correct himself. </p>
<p>There are the following scientific mistakes in this Prophetic Hadith:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Madhī</em> (pre-ejaculate or precum) is a white fluid, which is different from <em>manī</em> (semen or cum). <em>Manī</em> contains a man’s sperm. When a man and woman engage in acts of desire like kissing, only <em>madhī</em> is released. A man only releases sperm in the form of <em>manī</em> when he experiences an orgasm, and this happens in a large quantity. However, even if a woman experiences an orgasm, she does not release any extra fluid that would contain her eggs (female sperm), nor does she release anything that is yellow in color or in a large amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a man experiences a dream during his youth, it manifests as a wet dream in the form of an orgasm, in which not just pre-ejaculate fluid (مذی) is released, but actual semen. This semen is released in such a quantity that it dampens the clothes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, when a woman experiences an erotic dream, or even if she has an orgasm in the dream (which is a very rare occurrence), at most, a white fluid known as arousal fluid (the female equivalent of pre-ejaculate fluid, مذی) may cause her vagina to become slightly wet. In the case of a dream, the amount is not enough to dampen clothes like in a male wet dream. This same arousal fluid is released in women when a man and woman engage in passionate kissing or similar activities. However, in a waking state, Islam classifies this arousal fluid in women as مذی (pre-ejaculate fluid) and does not consider it a wet dream, nor does it make a ritual bath (ghusl) obligatory. Thus, it remains a mistake of Muhammad, when he claims that women discharge any fluid which contains female gametes during dreams, which can make bath obligatory for them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to science, whether due to feelings of arousal in a dream or while awake, or during sex, a woman's vagina never produces any yellow-colored fluid, regardless of how many multiple orgasms she may experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, Muhammad is also completely mistaken regarding the resemblance of a child. The child's resemblance to the mother is not related to fluids, nor to the dominance of the man's fluid, but rather to the woman's egg (ovum) and the man's sperm. Today, science has entirely debunked the fluid theory by taking a woman's egg and creating a baby in a test tube.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Please Keep in mind!</strong></p>
<p>According to Islamic claims, revelation is considered 100% perfect and cannot be wrong. Therefore, if there is even a single mistake in any aspect of the revelation, the entire foundation of Islam would collapse as a result. It cannot be argued that if one part is incorrect, the rest of the revelation is still valid.</p>
<p>Firstly, the remaining revelations are also filled with scientific inaccuracies. Secondly, both God and His revelation operate under the premise of absolute perfection. If even one revelation contains a scientific error, it undermines the entire framework of Islam.</p>
<h2><strong>Muslim Justification for Yellow Semen:</strong></h2>
<p>For a long time, this hadith has been a contentious issue among Muslims, difficult for them to fully accept or dismiss it. In response, some Muslim scholars try to make this excuse that the Prophet was referring to the Graafian follicle, which produces a yellowish fluid.</p>
<p>However, this justification is flawed for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Graafian follicle is not located in the vagina; it is found in the ovaries (part of the uterus).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, the Graafian follicle does not release any fluid during sleep or sexual activity. Instead, it releases fluid only once every 28 days, and this release is not related to sex, arousal, or dreams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the yellow fluid produced by the Graafian follicle remains within the body and does not reach the vagina, let alone become visible externally. Even if a woman get multiple orgasms, this yellow fluid is still never released from the vagina. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the Prophet, this yellow fluid is released due to arousal in dreams, a claim that science entirely refutes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, this issue remains a challenge for Muslims, and despite attempts to provide justifications, they seem unable to resolve the contradictions presented by this hadith.</p>
<h2><strong>The Prophet Derived Incorrect Science from the Greek Physician Galen</strong></h2>
<p>Muhammad presented the theory of the physician Galen (an erroneous scientific theory). Galen also cited the fluid released by women during orgasm as evidence that semen exists in females, contributing to their resemblance to the mother of the child. Galen writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Indeed it would have been much better to trust the visible evidence that the semen of females exists and to inquire by reasoning what its power is. The visible evidence was given before and will be given again. Spermatic ducts, full of semen, secrete this semen apart from the union of female with male, <strong>females experiencing effusions in sleep as males do</strong>."</p>
<p>Reference:<br>Philip De Lacy (editor and translator). “Galen: On Semen (Corpus Medicorum Graecorum 5.3.1.),” p. 153, Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1992.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same page, Galen criticizes other physicians who refused to accept it. Galen argues that, on the contrary, this fluid is also released from the uterus. In other sections, Galen reiterates the theory that this fluid is expelled during orgasm, and when it is released during sleep, it exits through the vagina (wetting the woman’s clothes).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On p. 151, Galen states that the female semen "in effusions in sleep first descends into the uterus, and after that is voided to the outside" and describes the case of a widow who "convulsed, and at these tensions the semen was discharged, and she said the pleasure it gave her was like that of sexual intercourse." On p. 87, he states, "When, therefore, the female produces semen at the same time as the male, the semen discharged through each of the two horns and carried to the middle of the hollow of the uterus coats the passages and at the same time reaches the male semen."</p>

        <h3>The Ridiculous Level of Incoherence in the Quran</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can this Quran be a miracle, when it is so incoherent that thousands of the top commentators of the Quran of the last 14 centuries are trying to understand it, but are still unable to do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the verses which were revealed during the Meccan period are present in the Medinan Surahs and vice versa, making it impossible for a normal person to understand which verse is talking about which incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This disorder is not limited to the Surahs (Chapter), but this disease goes beyond this issue. For example, even in a single verse, the first part talks about one event, but the second part starts talking about another event which took place years apart, and then the 3rd part of the same verse starts talking again about the 1st event again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at this verse from the Quran:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:521">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.3">5:3</a>:</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:521"><strong><span style="color: #0600ff;">[1st part of the verse 5:3 about the <span style="color: #ff0000;">EVENT 1</span>]</span></strong> Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, the strangled animal, that beaten to death, that which has fallen from a height, that which has been gored by horns, and that which has been preyed upon by wild beasts, except for that which you have slaughtered [according to Islamic law], and that which has been sacrificed on [stone] altars. And forbidden to you is fortune-telling by arrows. This is transgression.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:296"><span style="color: #0600ff;"><strong>[2nd part of the verse 5:3 which starts talking about the <span style="color: #ff0000;">EVENT 2</span>, which happened many years later after the event 1]</strong></span> This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, but fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:243"><strong>[<span style="color: #2800ff;">3rd part of the verse 5:3, which again starts talking about the</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">EVENT 1</span>]</strong> But whoever is compelled by severe hunger, neither inclining willfully to sin nor transgressing its limit, there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the commentators of the Quran are unanimous that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first part of this verse is about Haram (prohibited) foods, and this order was revealed in the </span><strong><i>6th Hijri year</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time of the Pact of Hudaybiyyah. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the 2nd (middle) part of this verse suddenly started talking about the "Perfection of Religion", and this part was revealed at a totally different time in the </span><b>10th Hijri year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about 81 days before the death of Muhammad. And this part has nothing to do with the previous part of the verse. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the 3rd and last part of the verse (i.e. sentence) again returns to the first </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incident about Haram foods, which was revealed at the incident of the Pact of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hudaybiyyah in the </span><b>6th Hijri year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maulana Modoodi wrote in his commentary of the Quran under this verse (<a href="https://www.tafheemulquran.net/1_Tafheem/Suraes/005/16.html">link</a>):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“According to authentic traditions, this 2nd part of the verse (about the perfection of religion) was revealed at the time of “Last Sermon” in the </span><b>10th Hijri year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the initial part of the verse was about the Pact of Hudaybiyyah (which happened in the<strong> </strong></span><strong><i>6th Hijri year</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maulana Taqi Uthmani wrote in his commentary of the Quran under this verse (<a href="https://www.quranohadith.com/alquran-tafseer/5/3">link</a>) :</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Jews said to Umar Ibn Khattab, had this verse “This day have I perfected for you your religion” revealed upon them, then they would have taken it as a day of Eid (celebration). Upon that Umar told the Jews that they didn't know that two Eids of Muslims were combined on this day. This verse was revealed in the <b><i>10 th Hijri year</i></b> at the incident of "Last Sermon" at the place of "Urfa" at the time of "Asr Prayer". There were 40 thousand companions with prophet Muhammad. And the holy prophet remained alive for 81 days after this incident.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there any book other than the Quran which could be so much Incoherent?</span></p>
<p>For sure, even the Bible is also incoherent in many places, but still, it is tens of times better in incoherence than the Quran and even a normal person can understand it while reading it. But this thing is not possible with the Quran, and a normal person is absolutely not able to understand it, despite the big claims of Muslims and the Quran itself that Allah made the Quran easy to understand for the people. </p>
<p><span style="color: #ba372a; background-color: #eccafa;"><em>Actually, the biggest miracle is how billions of Muslims could consider such an incoherent book like the Quran to be a miracle. </em></span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Linguistic Mistake in the Quran, Indicating Its Human Origins</h3>
<p>Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/11/default.htm">4:11</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِىٓ أَوْلَٰدِكُمْ ۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ ۚ فَإِن كُنَّ <span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong>نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ</strong></span> فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ ۖ وَإِن كَانَتْ وَٰحِدَةً فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصْفُ ۚ </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Instructs you Allah concerning your children - for the male like (the) portion (of) two females. But if there are (only) women (i.e. daughters) </span><span style="color: #e03e2d; background-color: #fbeeb8;">more (than) two</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, then for them two thirds (of) what he left. And if (there) is (only) one, then for her (is) half. (</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;verse=11">Word by Word Translation by Corpus Quran</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allah is incorrectly using the phrase “<strong>more than two daughters</strong>” when He actually wanted to say “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”.</p>
<p>Please read the detailed article <a href="../divine-revelation-or-a-human-drama/quran-s-mathematical-mistakes-in-the-inheritance-laws.html">here.</a></p>
<p>It is a clear linguistic mistake, and it happened while no Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own, and he was not safe from making human mistakes like these. </p>
<p>All Muslim Scholars agree that two daughters will get 2/3 of the estate.</p>
<p>Muhammad himself distributed 2/3rd of the estate between two daughters. </p>
<p>Sunan Tirmidhi, 2092:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The wife of Sa’d bin Rabi’ came with the two daughters of Sa’d to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, these are the two daughters of Sa’d. He was killed with you on the day of Uhud, and their paternal uncle has taken all that their father left behind, and a woman is only married for her wealth.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent until the Verse of inheritance was revealed to him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the brother of Sa’d bin Rabi’ and said: ‘Give the two daughters of Sa’d two thirds of his wealth, and give his wife on eighth, and take what is left.’”</p>

<h4>Tehrif (Distortion) Case:</h4>
<p>It was such a big error, that modern Muslims Quran Translators have to make a TEHRIF (Distortion) in its translation, and change it to “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”. For example, look at the translation of Yousuf Ali. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Quran 4:11</a>) Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, <span style="color: #236fa1; background-color: #eccafa;"><strong>two or more</strong></span>, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. (<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Yusuf Ali, Saudi Revised Edition,1985</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here are some other modern Quran Translators, who followed this distorted translation of “two or more daughters”. </p>

<p>It is unfortunate that modern Muslim apologists have made dishonesty HALAL for themselves. They distort, they hide, they tell clear lies ... but the truth will still become evident. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The negligence of the Quran resulted in the "suffering" of millions </h3>
<p>Let us look at an example of slave women. There are only those Quranic verses present in the Quran, which tell that having sex with them is Halal (permissible). But there is not a single verse present in the Quran about the "human rights" of slave women.</p>
<p>It resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past 1400 years, millions of slave women were forced to roam in public without the Hijab and with naked chests. All 4 Sunni Imams (actually all early (i.e. Salaf) Muslims of the first 450 years agreed upon it, while there is no verse in the Quran which denies it. </li>
<li>And all millions of captive/slave women were "raped" by Muslim men in a "Temporary" sexual relationship (like Shia Mut'ah). An owner fulfilled his lust by raping the slave girl, and then after getting bored with her, he sold her in the Islamic Bazaar of slavery. And then he bought himself a new slave girl and started raping her. Poor slave girls were sold multiple times, and they were multiple times raped by multiple different men. All this happened while there is not a single verse present in the Quran about the rights of slave women. </li>
<li>The children of slave parents were also born automatically as slaves due to the evil of "Slavery by Birth" in Islam. When the babies got two molar teeth (at about the age of 6 months), they were separated from their slave mothers and were sold in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery. </li>
<li>If a Muslim owner got a lust for the wife of his male slave, then he simply took her for himself, raped her, and after fulfilling his lust, sent him back to her husband (i.e. his male slave). This was practised by all Muslims during their 1300-year-long history of Islamic slavery. </li>
</ul>
<p>For details and proof, please read our article: <a href="../islamic-slavery/crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity.html">The Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity</a></p>
<p>The Quran is a huge voluminous book, but it is filled with only old fantasy tales and lofty claims about the greatness of Allah. Meanwhile, it has neglected the rights and well-being of humanity. Only a single verse was enough to free millions of slave women from the evil of being raped. Only a single verse was enough that the 6-month-old babies were not separated from their mothers and sold in the Bazaars of Slavery ...</p>
<p>How can then such a book be called a miracle? </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Mathematical Mistake in the Quran</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>(1) When SHARES make less than the Estate (An <a href="https://islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/133406/العصبة-في-المواريث">'Asbah عصبة</a> Case)</strong></span></span></p>
<p>For instance, let's consider a scenario where an individual passes away, leaving behind one daughter, parents, and wife. In such a case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The share of the daughter is 1/2 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“...and if there is only one daughter, then she shall have half the inheritance.” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.12">4:12</a>]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of shares in this case is calculated as follows: 1/2 for the daughter + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 0.96.</p>
<p>To illustrate, if the deceased left behind $1000, according to the Qur'an, the judge would only need to distribute $960 among the heirs, leaving $40 remaining.</p>
<p>When confronted with this mathematical error, Muhammad found it impossible to rectify. As a solution, he advised them to allocate the remaining portion of the estate to the nearest "male" relative <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(Source: </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/23/2">Sahih Muslim, 1615a</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">). This is known as </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/133406/العصبة-في-المواريث">'Asbah عصبة</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></p>
<p>While the remaining amount of $40 USD in this particular scenario may appear insignificant for the next male relative, little did Muhammad know that it would turn out to be a fatal mistake. This error resulted in Islamic rulings that are deemed ridiculous, illogical, and unjust towards women.</p>
<p>Allow me to provide a few examples to demonstrate the unjust nature of these inheritance laws, and your human intellect will naturally recognize their lack of wisdom.</p>
<p>Numerous online Islamic inheritance calculators are available. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://inheritance.ilmsummit.org/">Calculator 1</a> (A simple Islamic inheritance calculator).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.inheritance-calculator.com/">Calculator 2</a> (A detailed Islamic inheritance calculator)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please use any online calculator to verify the following examples. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1st Example: Old Widow will get 25%, while a “MALE” relative (even a distant one like a cousin, or his son, or his grandson) will get 75% </strong></p>
<p>In the case where the deceased has no children but only a wife and a distant male relative (such as a cousin, son, or grandson), the distribution of shares would be as follows:</p>
<p>The widow will receive 25% of the inheritance, while the "male" relative, regardless of their proximity, will receive the remaining 75%.</p>

</table>
<p>In the case of a wife who remains with her husband throughout her life, it may seem unjust that when she becomes a widow in her old age, she is entitled to only 25% of the inheritance. Meanwhile, the remaining 75% of the inheritance is awarded to a distant male relative, such as a cousin or any of his descendants, whom the deceased person may have never even encountered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this arrangement appear sensible to you?</li>
<li>Can you discern any divine wisdom in this particular Islamic law?</li>
<li>Do you believe that justice has been served to women by Muhammad/Allah in this regard?</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the opposite scenario does not hold true. If a woman passes away, her husband will inherit all her property, regardless of the presence of her closest relatives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2nd Example: Mother will get 33.33%, while distant relatives (like cousins, or his son, or his grandson) will get 66.67%</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, if the deceased person has an old mother and a distant male relative, the distribution of shares would be as follows:</p>
<table id="dgSharesIndiv" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 38.0997%; height: 136px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1" rules="all" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">

<p>Therefore, in this case, the old mother will receive only 33.33% of the inheritance, while a cousin (or his descendants, whom the deceased person may not have even encountered in his entire life) will receive 66.67%.</p>
<p>One might question the rationale behind this distribution and whether any divine wisdom can be perceived in it.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Example: Sister will get much more share in inheritance than the mother and the wife</strong></p>
<p>Even if the sister is married, she will still receive a larger share of the inheritance compared to the mother or the wife.</p>

<p>Despite the closer bond between a mother and her son, the illogical distribution of shares dictated by the Quran results in the sister receiving a larger inheritance portion than the mother (even if the sister is married).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the widow's share is even smaller than that of the mother, while the sister's share becomes even more substantial.</p>

<p>These inequitable and absurd divisions are a result of the illogical Islamic laws of inheritance, which lack any divine wisdom.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>(2) When SHARES make MORE than the Estate (An <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance">'Awl عول</a> Case)</strong></span></span></p>
<p>For instance, in the case where an individual passes away, leaving behind three daughters, parents, and wife, the distribution of inheritance would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The share of the three daughters is 2/3 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“...If (the heirs of the deceased are) more than two daughters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.12">4:12</a>]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of shares in this scenario is calculated as 2/3 for the daughters + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 1.125.</p>
<p>In other words, if the deceased left behind 1000 dinars, according to the Quran, the judge would require 1125 dinars to distribute among the heirs, which exceeds the available amount.</p>
<p>Muhammad passed away without providing any solution to rectify this mathematical mistake in the Quran or Hadith.</p>
<p>Later, a similar case was presented to 'Umar Ibn Khattab, and he also found himself at a loss regarding what to do. However, someone suggested that he proportionally reduce the share of all heirs, and 'Umar adopted this "self-made" solution in an attempt to address the mathematical error in the Quran <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">). </span></p>
<p>However, Ibn Abbas disagreed with 'Umar's approach, and Shia Muslims also have a different perspective. They proposed an alternative "self-fabricated" solution (<a href="https://www.bzu.edu.pk/PJIR/vol10/eng 6 Shahbaz Cheema 04-11-13.pdf#page=9">link</a>).</p>

<h3>Scientific Blunders in the Quran</h3>
<p>According to Islam, Allah is believed to be completely 100% perfect. As a result, if it can be demonstrated that there is even a "single" scientific error in the Islamic revelation, it would undermine the entire foundation of Islam, which is built upon the premise of Allah's 100% infallibility. Modern Science is an ultimate weapon which will expose false religions and dismantle their claims sooner or later.</p>

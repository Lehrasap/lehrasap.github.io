<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3227" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Sunnan Nisai</a> and <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2050" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Sunnan Abu Dawud</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It was narrated that Ma'qil bin Yasar said: "A man came to the Messenger of Allah and said: 'I have found a woman who is from a good family and of good status, but she does not bear children, should I marry her?' <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">He told him not to (marry her)</strong>. Then he came to him a second time and he told him not to (marry her). Then he came to him a third time and he told him not to (marry her), then he said: '<strong>Marry the one who is fertile and loving</strong>, for I will boast of your great numbers.'"<br>Sheikh Albani graded it as an Authentic (Sahih) tradition (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/73416/is-it-haraam-to-marry-a-woman-who-cannot-have-children" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Muhammad ordered: "<strong>Marry the one who is fertile and loving"</strong>.</p>
<p>But here occurs a problem. Today Muslims are totally confused and asking this question themselves (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140612004851/http://forum.mohaddis.com/threads/شادی-سے-پہلے-بیوی-کو-کس-طرح-پہچانے-گا-کہ-وہ-محبت-کرنے-والی-اور-بچے-پیدا-کرنے-والی-ہے؟.23334">link</a>): <strong>"How do you find out before marriage which woman is fertile and the loving one?</strong>"</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If a woman is divorced/widow, then one could estimate if she is fertile/loving or not,<strong> but how to estimate these 2 characteristics in a virgin girl</strong>? </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is proof enough to conclude that there was no Allah behind the revelations, and Muhammad was giving these Sharia rulings on his own, and that is why we find these human errors in these rulings. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And Muhammad in another Hadith asked to marry virgin girls instead of divorced/widow women.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5080">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5080</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: When I got married, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, "What type of lady have you married?" I replied, "I have married a matron' He said, "Why, don't you have a liking for the virgins and for fondling them?" Jabir also said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And Muhammad claimed the following about the virgin girls, that they bear more children:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1861">Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 1861</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">عَلَيْكُمْ بِالأَبْكَارِ فَإِنَّهُنَّ أَعْذَبُ أَفْوَاهًا وَأَنْتَقُ أَرْحَامًا وَأَرْضَى بِالْيَسِيرِ</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">“The Messenger of Allah said: 'You should marry virgins, for their mouths are sweeter, their wombs are more prolific (i.e. they bear many children) and they are satisfied with less.'”<br>(<a href="https://dorar.net/h/8db83b0b91847fb8168890c864e269d6">Hasan- Fair Hadith</a>) According to Albani</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, these assertions lack logical connections and demonstrate further human error on Muhammad's part, while:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is not connected with the virginity of a woman if her mouth is sweeter or not, but it is linked with her own behaviour. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the guarantee that a woman is going to bear many children (i.e. their wombs being prolific) does not lie in her virginity, but this lies in her health. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And there is no connection in it that virgin girls become satisfied with less, while widow/divorced women don't become satisfied with less. </li>
</ul>
<p>All these claims from Muhammad are once again proving only one thing there ss no divine Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making all this religion  honis own and thus we find all these human errors in the revelation. </p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">All 4 Sunni Fiqh Imams agree that a wife can not take a divorce if a man is infertile. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The largest Islamic Fatwa website IslamQ&amp;A writes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211011105923/https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21592/ruling-on-asking-for-a-divorce-from-a-husband-who-has-some-medical-problems">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">With regard to the man’s sterility, i.e., his inability to father children, this is not counted as a fault that would necessitate annulment of the marriage, according to the majority of scholars, apart from the view of al-Hasan al-Basri, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Actually, it was impossible to find out if a man was infertile in the previous centuries. Therefore, it was impossible to blame the man for infertility. This was probably the case with Muhammad himself. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Note:</strong> </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There is a difference between:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being Impotent</li>
<li>Being Infertile</li>
</ol>
<p>Islam allows a woman to take a divorce through an Islamic court in case her husband is impotent and cannot perform sex. </p>
<p>But if the husband is infertile (i.e. he cannot bear children), then she will not get a divorce through any Islamic court. But she will be compelled to stay with her husband the whole of her life without any childen. </p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId818913"></a>Combination of two Evils: She cannot take divorce from her infertile husband + Islam separates her from her adopted son when he is 12-13 years old</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The cruelty of Islamic Sharia does not end here where it does not let a woman take a divorce from an infertile man and to marry another person, in order to fulfil her natural desire to have children. But this cruelty against women goes even further. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If she adopts a child as a son, then Islam separates that son from her once he is 12-13 years old. </p>
<p><a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129988/a-family-adopted-him-because-his-family-were-bad-people-and-they-gave-him-their-name-what-are-the-consequences-of-that">Fatwa from Saudi Salafi Fatwa website: Isalm Q&amp;A:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> I am fifteen years old. I was adopted by an Afghan family when I was six months old ... What are the rulings in my situation?</p>
<p><strong><em>Answer:</em></strong> ...  The woman (i.e. the foster mother) who adopted you is a non-mahram to you, and it is not permissible for you to see her, let alone touch her or kiss her when you are not a mahram to her or to her daughters. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there was an incident where a pair was unable to have a baby of their own, and thus they adopted another baby. Mother raised him as her own child. But as soon as he became an adult, then their relatives started demanding that he should be expelled from the house, and the mother should observe Hijab from him and not let him in the house when she is alone, and they should cut all the mother-son relationships with each other.</p>
<p>But the mother became extremely angry and she refused to cut the mother-son relationship with him.</p>
<p>Upon that, the Mufti gave <em>fatwa</em> that they are now non-Mahram for each other and cannot continue to have the mother-son relationship, and she should observe Hijab from him, and he should be expelled from the house. </p>
<p>Are Muslims able to see the calamity that Islam brought upon that poor mother and her adopted son? </p>

<p>Muhammad died at age of 63 years, but he married the last woman (Amrah) at age of 60.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, the question is, why didn't he marry another woman during his last 3 years?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The answer lies in the huge scandal of the secret sexual relationship of Mariyah (his slave girl).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2771" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Sahih Muslim</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anas reported that a person (a Coptic slave, who was the cousin of Maria al-Qibtiyya) was charged with fornication with the slave girl of Allah's Messenger (i.e. Maria al-Qibtiyya). Thereupon Allah's Messenger said to 'Ali: Go and strike his neck. 'Ali came to him and he found him in a well making his body cool. 'Ali said to him: Come out, and as he took hold of his hand and brought him out, he found that his sexual organ had been cut. Hadrat 'Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah's Apostle and said: Allah's Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Why was that Coptic slave charged with fornication with Mariya?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">While Muhammad failed to make any other of his existing 12 wives bear a child for the last decade. Thus, people considered Muhammad to be infertile. In this situation, when slave girl Mariya became pregnant, then rumours arose that Mariya had a hidden sexual relationship with her cousin (i.e. the Coptic slave).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad ordered the killing of that Coptic slave without any court trial or witnesses.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="../divine-revelation-or-a-human-drama/muhammad-ordered-killing-an-innocent-man-in-his-personal-case.html">Muhammad ordered the killing of a person without any court trial &amp; witness in his personal case</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even after it became clear that Coptic slave didn't have the sexual organ, still Muhammad kept on suspecting Mariya of illegal sex. But he was unable to punish Mariya without the witnesses. And then people started making even more rumours about it. In order to make their mouths shut, Muhammad then claimed that Jibrael came and confirmed that Mariya was pregnant with a child from him.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Ibn Kathir recorded the following tradition:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anas said, when Ibrahim was born to Muhammad (from his slave-girl Maria al-Qibtiyya), then Muhammad became doubtful if Ibrahim was really his son or not. Upon that angel Jibrael came to him and confirmed to him that Ibrahim was indeed his son. Only after that Muhammad believed that Ibrahim was his son.<br>Reference: al-Baday wa al-Nahaya by Ibn Kathir, under the Incidents of 11th Hijri year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But Muhammad himself kept on doubting the parentage of Ibrahim (his son from Mariya) even till his death.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2316" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer">Sahih Muslim</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">فلما توفى إبراهيم قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ان إبراهيم ابني وانه مات في الثدي وان له لظئرين تكملان رضاعه في الجنة</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"... then when Ibrahim demised the holy prophet of Islam (peace be upon him) said, " Ibrahim<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU"> was indeed my son</strong> and passed away at the age of infancy"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, it seems that this huge scandal of the illegal sexual relationship of Mariya ended Muhammad's journey of marrying any other woman, while people had already been raising questions about Muhammad's fertility.</p>
<div class="_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></div>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad snatched away the right from his wives to fulfil their sexual desires after his death.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR">
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">He was most probably infertile himself, but he didn't offer his wives the option of getting a divorce on this basis. </p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">He also snatched away their right to have their own children and family after his death.</p>
</li>
<li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">At the end, all of them died childless and without any family life.</p>

<h2>Divorce:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="../women-and-divorce/the-unjust-process-of-3-talaqs-divorces-against-woman-in-islam.html"><strong>Divorce</strong></a>:</li>
</ul>
<p> A husband has the full right to divorce, but a woman does not. <strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../women-and-divorce/the-unjust-process-of-3-talaqs-divorces-against-woman-in-islam.html"><strong>The process of 3 Divorces</strong></a>:</li>
</ul>
<p> The process of issuing three Talaqs (divorces) is designed to punish a woman under the guise of reconciliation. She is forced to remain in her husband's house as a captive for three menstrual cycles (roughly three months), during which she is prohibited from having sex and affection, while the husband is allowed to engage with other wives or even slave women. <strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mod-articles-category-title " href="../women-and-divorce/no-khul-khl-for-a-woman-without-the-husband-s-consent.html"><strong>Khul’:</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p> Men alone hold the right to initiate a divorce. If a woman seeks a divorce, she must offer ransom money to her husband. If he accepts, she is granted her freedom. However, if he refuses, there is no way for an Islamic court to compel him to divorce her, leaving her trapped in an unhappy or abusive marriage with no recourse to escape. <strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="../women-and-divorce/evils-of-islamic-faskh-fskh-i-e-dissolution-of-marriage.html">Faskh (i.e. Dissolution of Marriage):</a> </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A woman can seek a divorce only under specific, severe circumstances that often require years of hardship. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The husband's whereabouts being unknown for four years,</li>
<li>The husband neglecting his duty to provide maintenance for two years,</li>
<li>The husband being imprisoned for seven years or more,</li>
<li>The husband failing to fulfill marital obligations for three years,</li>
<li>The husband suffering from insanity or a debilitating disease for two years. These conditions result in prolonged suffering for the woman before she can receive any relief.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mod-articles-category-title " href="../../women-and-divorce/22-liaan-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%a7%d9%86-a-husband-can-accuse-his-wife-of-adultery-without-any-4-witnesses%2c-but-if-a-wife-accuses-her-husband-for-adultery-or-rape-and-she-does-not-produce-4-eye-w"><strong>Liaan:</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p> A husband can accuse his wife of adultery without the need for four witnesses, but if a wife accuses her husband of adultery (or rape) without four witnesses, she faces 80 lashes. This double standard reflects a severe lack of equity. <strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mod-articles-category-title " href="../women-and-divorce/iddah-waiting-period-is-illogical-injustice-against-women.html"><strong>‘Iddah (waiting period)</strong>:</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Only women are subjected to the hardship of ‘Iddah, the waiting period after divorce or the death of a husband. A woman must mourn her husband's death for 4 months and 10 days, during which she cannot remarry. In contrast, a man does not have to observe any mourning period and can remarry immediately. <strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../women-and-divorce/strange-islam-a-woman-loses-custody-of-her-children-if-she-remarries.html"><strong>A woman loses custody of all her children if she remarries:</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>If a divorced woman remarries, she loses custody of her children. This rule is based on the idea that she cannot provide proper sexual services to her new husband while caring for children from her previous marriage. This places a woman in an untenable position, losing custody of her children simply because of remarriage. <strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../women-and-divorce/halala-tahleel-marriage.html"><strong>Halala (Tahleel Marriage)</strong>:</a><sup> </sup></li>
</ul>
<p>If a woman is divorced, even if the husband is at fault, she is forced to marry and have sex with another man in order to return to her first husband. This process, known as Halala, can be a form of sexual abuse and is a way for women to retain custody of their children after divorce. Without undergoing this humiliation, a woman could lose her children. <strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../women-and-divorce/ila-alayla-another-unjust-islamic-ruling-against-woman.html"><strong>Ila (الإيلاء):</strong></a> </li>
</ul>
<p>In Ila, a husband can refuse to engage in sexual relations with his wife for up to four months as a form of punishment. After four months, he may resume relations, then again leave her for another four months. This form of marital manipulation reflects the husband's control over the wife’s body, treating her as a possession. <strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="../women-and-divorce/zihar-another-unjust-islamic-way-to-divorce-a-woman.html">Zihar:</a> </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>If a man, in anger or by mistake, compares his wife to his mother or declares her to be like his mother, it becomes a form of separation. This is considered akin to divorce, and the woman is left to suffer due to the husband's words, without any recourse or justice. <strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<p>Throughout these various practices, it is clear that women face significant hardship, with few options for recourse or escape. There is a striking lack of equity between men and women in these situations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Hijab</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only women are required to suffocate themselves by wearing the Hijab.</li>
<li>Only their lives become dependent on male mahrams, as they cannot go out without a mahram man accompanying them.</li>
<li>The Hijab becomes a hindrance to their education and professional aspirations.</li>
<li>It limits their physical health and activities, as they cannot freely go out swimming, jogging, or playing sports in public spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Testimony</h2>
<ul>
<li>A woman's testimony is <strong>ZERO</strong> (i.e., not even HALF, and absolutely not accepted in an Islamic court) in the following serious cases of <strong>Hudud </strong>(<a href="women-s-testimony-is-not-even-half-but-zero-in-serious-hudud-cases.html">Link</a>):
<ul>
<li>Adultery</li>
<li>Rape</li>
<li>Murder</li>
<li>Robbery</li>
<li>Theft</li>
<li>Hirabah</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A woman's testimony is also <strong>ZERO</strong> (i.e., not even half) in cases not related to women's affairs, such as:
<ul>
<li><strong>Nikah</strong> (marriage)</li>
<li><strong>Talaq</strong> (divorce)</li>
<li><strong>Raju’</strong> (restitution of conjugal rights)</li>
<li><strong>Parentage</strong></li>
<li><strong>al-Wakalah</strong> (agency)</li>
<li><strong>Wills/Testaments</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A woman's testimony is only <strong>HALF</strong> in the following case:
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial matters</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>daughter</strong> will inherit <strong>only half</strong> of what a son receives.<br><strong>Full share for the son.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>sister</strong> will inherit <strong>only half</strong> of what a brother receives.<br><strong>Full share for the brother.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>If a man has no closer male relative (like father or son) then his <strong>wife</strong> will receive <strong>only 25%</strong>, while a distant male (like an uncle or his sons) relative will receive <strong>75%. </strong> <strong><a href="../divine-revelation-or-human-drama/166-mathematical-mistakes-in-the-quran-regarding-inheritance-laws.html">Link</a><br></strong>
<p><strong>But in a vice versa case, a husband gets a Full share. <br>Where is the equity where a wife is getting even less than the distant male relative? </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a man has no closer male relative (like father or son) then his <strong>mother</strong> will receive <strong>only 33%</strong>, while a distant male relative (like an uncle of his son) will receive <strong>67.77%. <a href="../divine-revelation-or-human-drama/166-mathematical-mistakes-in-the-quran-regarding-inheritance-laws.html">Link</a></strong><br><strong>But in a vice versa case, a father gets a Full share.<br>Where is the equity where a mother is getting even less than the distant male relative? </strong></p>

<h2>Does Islam treats Women like <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">QUEENS</span>?</h2>
<p>Islam places two key responsibilities solely on men, not on women:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dowry and Maintenance</strong> – Men are required to provide financial support, while women bear no such obligation.</li>
<li><strong>No Household Work</strong> – Wives are not obligated to cook or clean for their husbands (though fathers can require their daughters to do household work).</li>
</ol>
<p>Islamic preachers often use these points to promote the idea that Islam treats women like <strong>queens</strong>. However, this claim is misleading and deceptive. Let’s uncover the truth behind these Islamic rulings.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Dowry and Maintenance:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is the only right that Islam gives to women and not vice-versa</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Islamic preachers boast a lot that Islam has made women QUEENS while it puts all the financial burden of dowry and maintenance upon husbands. Unfortunately, they don't tell the whole truth that:</p>
<ul>
<li>How women<strong> lose a lot of their rights </strong>due to this dowry and maintenance issue, which make their lives a hell.</li>
<li>Moreover, if dowry and maintenance really means making women Queens, then it was the pre-Islamic Arab culture of the time of ignorance, which made them Queens, as they stipulated dowry and maintenance for wives, while Muhammad only copied it from them. </li>

  " href="islamist-s-accusation-the-west-put-double-burden-upon-women.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hardships that women have to face in the name of Mahr (Dowry)</span></strong></a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>In Islamic tradition, dowry (mahr) is seen as compensation for the sexual pleasure (tamtee') that a man derives from his wife, and the exclusive access to her body that he enjoys.</li>
<li>At the same time, he is free to marry multiple wives and engage in temporary sexual relationships with numerous slaves., but she is not allowed to even talk to any other man without the permission of his husband.  </li>
<li>And she has to provide him with sexual services, whenever he demands it, even if she is travelling on the back of a camel and delivering a child (according to Muhammad). </li>
<li>Thus, Mahr is the payment of those sexual services, which she is obliged to provide to her husband on DEMAND. </li>
<li>In in name of Mahr money, she is also compelled to <strong>mourn</strong> his death for 4 months and 10 days (where she cannot marry any other person), even if she never loved him. But if the wife dies, then the husband has no obligation to wait, but he is free to have sex with other women/slave girls the same night. </li>
<li>In the name of Mahr money, she is also compelled to undergo 'Iddah (waiting period) for 3 menstrual cycles if the husband divorces her. 'Iddah brings a lot of one-sided hardships and restrictions for women. <strong><a href="../women-and-divorce/iddah-waiting-period-is-illogical-injustice-against-women.html">Link</a></strong>. </li>
<li>She also gets ZERO share from the property if her husband divorces her (Whereas in the West, a woman gets half the share from the property that they made during their marriage period). She is told to use that same Mahr money to survive if she is divorced. </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;">Islam takes away many rights from a woman in the name of maintenance:</p>
<ul>
<li>She is prohibited to leave the house without the permission of her husband.</li>
<li>She is even prohibited from visiting her parents without his permission. </li>
<li>Her husband gets the right to <strong>beat</strong> her while he pays he money for maintenance.</li>
<li>She receives financial support, but only at the cost of surrendering her right to work outside the home and earn her own income. In practice, it is nearly impossible for a woman to find employment without her husband's permission, especially in societies where Islamic norms are strictly enforced.</li>
<li>If a husband mistreats and tortures his wife, she cannot initiate a divorce proceeding on her own. Even if the husband chooses to divorce her, she often lacks the means to support herself independently. As a result, she may be coerced into remarrying.</li>
<li>However, if she does choose to remarry, Islam dictates that she will lose custody of her children (<a href="../women-and-divorce/strange-islam-a-woman-loses-custody-of-her-children-if-she-remarries.html">Link</a>).</li>
<li>She has the duty to put perfume and make her beautiful to provide him with sex services on demand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<p>In simple words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slaves are also fed and maintained.</li>
<li>Prisoners in the prisons are also fed and maintained. </li>
<li>And women in Islam are not much different than slaves and prisoners. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Islam even allows man to BLACKMAIL women to give up their rights to Dowry and Maintenance Money:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Man can blackmail women into Misyaar marriage, where he has to give neither Mahr nor Maintenance money to women. </li>
<li>Even in normal Nikah marriage, again men are fully allowed to blackmail wives to give up their rights to Mahr or Maintenance money by threatening them to divorce them, or by not treating them well.</li>
<li>Muhammad himself blackmailed old lady Sawdah to give up her right to night turns by threatening her with divorce. <a href="../divine-revelation-or-human-drama/54-role-of-revelation-in-prophet-s-journey-from-4-marriages-to-9-marriages.html">Link</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where is the equity?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(186, 55, 42); text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Islamic System of Dowry (Mahr) and Maintenance (Nafaqah) is Completely "Unbalanced" and Unjust to Both Men and Women</strong></span></span></p>
<p>The Islamic system of maintenance (Nafaqah) is fundamentally <strong>unbalanced</strong> because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Burden Solely on the Husband:</strong><br>The entire financial responsibility is placed solely on the husband, regardless of his circumstances. It does not consider whether the husband is poor, becomes ill, or loses his job. It essentially becomes a gamble because no one knows if he will face illness, unemployment, or other financial hardships in the future. Yet, in all such cases, the financial burden remains entirely on the husband.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mahr as a Gamble:</strong><br>No one knows whether the marriage will last or end in divorce. If divorce happens, even as early as the following week, the wife is entitled to the full mahr amount, leaving the husband at a financial loss. For the husband, Islamic marriage becomes a gamble where he pays a hefty mahr upfront, assuming a lifetime commitment from his wife, only to face the risk of divorce shortly after.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comparison with the Western System:</strong><br>In contrast, the Western system is far more balanced. If the wife is wealthy, has a stable and successful business, and is in good health, she is expected to share financial responsibilities equally. This allows her to support her husband in times of financial difficulty. Moreover, the husband does not face the risk of gambling on a large dowry amount before the marriage.</p>
<p>This system ensures a more equitable and fair distribution of financial responsibilities, reducing the strain and risk placed on one individual in the marriage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Household Work (cleaning, cooking etc.):</h2>
<p>For those, who don't know about it, here are some details:</p>
<p>Many classical scholars, including those from the <strong>Hanafi, Maliki, and Shafi'i</strong> schools, argue that a woman’s primary obligation in marriage is <strong>to be available for her husband in matters of companionship and intimacy</strong>, but she is <strong>not required</strong> to perform household chores.</p>
<p>Imam Ibn Hazm, a prominent scholar of the Zahiri school, stated in his work <a class="relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

<blockquote>
<p>1906 - مسألة : ولا يلزم المرأة أن تخدم زوجها في شيء أصلا ، لا في عجن ، ولا طبخ ، ولا فرش ، ولا كنس ، ولا غزل ، ولا نسج ، ولا غير ذلك أصلا - ولو أنها فعلت لكان أفضل لها وعلى الزوج أن يأتيها بكسوتها مخيطة تامة ، وبالطعام مطبوخا تاما وإنما عليها أن تحسن عشرته ، ولا تصوم تطوعا وهو حاضر إلا بإذنه ، ولا تدخل [ ص: 228 ] بيته من يكره ، وأن لا تمنعه نفسها متى أراد ، وأن تحفظ ما جعل عندها من ماله</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1906 - Issue: It is not obligatory for a woman to serve her husband in any way at all—neither in kneading dough, nor cooking, nor arranging the house, nor sweeping, nor spinning, nor weaving, nor anything else. However, if she does so, it would be better for her, and it is incumbent upon the husband to provide her with fully stitched clothing and fully cooked food. Her only obligations are to treat him well, not to fast voluntarily when he is present without his permission, not to allow into his house anyone he dislikes, not to deny herself to him when he desires, and to safeguard what he entrusts to her.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(191, 237, 210);"><strong>The practice of women not performing household tasks in Islam originated from the cultural norms of Muhammad’s time, </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); background-color: rgb(191, 237, 210);"><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">where women from noble Arab families were exempt from such household work</span>—just as they had the privilege of wearing the hijab, a right not extended to lower-status women, prostitutes, or slaves.</strong></span></p>
<p>Once again, Islamic preachers proudly claim that Islam treats women like queens because it does not require them to cook or clean. However, they deliberately deceive and hide the <strong>darker side</strong> of this Islamic ruling. Let's see the truth:</p>
<p><strong>1. This Unfair Islamic Ruling Deserves <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Condemnation</span>, Not <span style="color: rgb(5, 0, 255);">Praise</span></strong>:</p>
<p>Basic human reasoning makes it clear that this ruling is not something to be admired—it is completely unbalanced and unjust toward husbands. How can it be fair to expect a man to not only provide dowry and full financial support for maintenance, but also take on household chores after an exhausting day of work? And while the man has to work hard outside, the woman stays lazy in her bed and does nothing at home? </p>
<p>2. <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Credit</span> of this <span style="color: rgb(5, 0, 255);">unjust</span> System goes to pre-Islamic Arab Society of the time of IGNORANCE</strong>: </p>
<p>If you still insist on praising this unjust system, then credit should go to the <strong>pre-Islamic Arab society of Jahiliyyah</strong>, not Islam. This system treated women as mere commodities—valued only for providing sexual services and bearing children. In return, they received dowry and financial support. They were not required to cook or clean, but in exchange, they had to <strong>give up other fundamental rights</strong>—such as the freedom to leave the house without a man's permission. They were also expected to <strong>maintain their beauty, remain obedient at all times, and be available 24/7 to fulfill their husband's sexual demands</strong>. They were also expected to obey their husbands without question—any defiance could result in severe beatings, often leaving bruises. So, how can poor Muslim women, who had to endure such treatment, be considered "queens"?</p>
<p><strong>3. Islam was not even for <span style="color: rgb(5, 0, 255);">Bedouin</span>, but only for <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NOBLE Families</span> of Arab:</strong></p>

Instead, men—especially husbands or heads of households—were responsible for providing sustenance and protection, often delegating tasks like cooking or cleaning to slaves or servants, or lower-status family members. On the other hand, rural or Bedouin women often had more hands-on roles out of necessity. The concept of a husband providing for his wife’s needs, which later crystallized as </span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy r-36ujnk"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy">nafaqah</span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"> in Islamic law, was copied from these pre-Islamic practices where a man’s honor and nobility were tied to such customs. </span></span></p>

<p><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Islamic apologists, although, proudly highlight this ruling when it suits their narrative, portraying it as proof that Islam elevates women by freeing them from household chores. However, at the same time, they are doing everything possible to distance themselves from it in practice.</span></span></p>
<p data-start="79" data-end="345">Islamic scholars have long struggled to justify this outdated and imbalanced system—essentially dethroning the so-called "Muslim queens" from their supposed thrones. Over time, they have developed different strategies to quietly sidestep or downplay these rulings:</p>
<ul data-start="347" data-end="1833">
<li data-start="347" data-end="870">
<p data-start="350" data-end="870"><strong data-start="350" data-end="386">Keeping Muslim Women Uninformed:</strong><br data-start="386" data-end="389">The first tactic is ensuring that most Muslim women remain unaware of these rights. Even though Islamic law books clearly state that wives are not obligated to cook or clean, this information is rarely—if ever—shared in Friday sermons or religious teachings. Until recently, very few women even knew about these rulings, and it was only through social media that awareness began to spread. Yet, even today, a large number of Muslim women remain in the dark about these rights.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="872" data-end="1230">
<p data-start="875" data-end="1230"><strong data-start="875" data-end="925">Encouraging Voluntary Submission Through Fear:</strong><br data-start="925" data-end="928">If women do become aware of these rights, they are told that Allah will be pleased with them if they still choose to cook and clean. Otherwise, their husbands have full authority to divorce them without providing any reason, creating pressure to comply out of fear rather than genuine willingness.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1232" data-end="1833" data-is-last-node="">
<p data-start="1235" data-end="1536"><strong data-start="1235" data-end="1278">Altering the Original Ruling Over Time:</strong><br data-start="1278" data-end="1281">More than 700 years after these rulings were established, Islamic scholars like <strong data-start="1364" data-end="1381" data-is-only-node="">Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> attempted to modify them. In his legal collection <em data-start="1432" data-end="1450">Majmu' al-Fatawa</em>, he suggested that household duties depend on a woman’s social background, stating (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1704/does-a-wife-have-to-cook-and-clean">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote data-start="1540" data-end="1649">
<p data-start="1542" data-end="1649">"This varies according to circumstances. What a Bedouin wife has to do (such as household work) is not the same as what an urban wife has to do."</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="1657" data-end="1833" data-is-last-node="">This shift in interpretation shows an attempt to adapt Islamic rulings to changing societal norms, further proving that even Muslims recognize the impracticality of these laws.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. A Balanced Approach in the Western System:</strong></p>
<p data-start="53" data-end="275">Unlike Islam, the Western system maintains balance in household responsibilities. If a woman stays at home, she is generally expected to handle domestic tasks, while a working couple shares household duties more equally.</p>
<p data-start="277" data-end="682" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Legally, a woman in the West can still refuse to cook or clean, and her husband cannot force her. However, the key difference is that Western law does not impose an obligation on the husband to provide her with a slave or servant, as Islamic law does. In the West, a man has the choice to stay with such a partner or separate, but he is not burdened with the legal duty of hiring a servant in the name of "maintenance."</p>

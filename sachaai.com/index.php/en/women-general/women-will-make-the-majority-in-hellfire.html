        <p>Muhammad asserted that the majority of inhabitants in hellfire would be women due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaging in frequent cursing.</li>
<li>Displaying ingratitude towards their husbands.</li>
<li>Exhibiting deficiencies in performing good religious deeds when compared to men.</li>
</ul>
<div><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:29">Sahih Bukhari, 29</a>:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful." It was asked, "Do they disbelieve in Allah?" (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied, "They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors and the good done to them. If you have always been good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees something in you (not of her liking), she will say, 'I have never received any good from you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304">Sahih al-Bukhari, 304</a> (translated by Mohsin Khan)</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) of `Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. (Yet) A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you." The women asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her religion."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Let's examine the four alleged shortcomings of women that Muhammad claimed as reasons for the majority of women ending up in hellfire.</p>
<p><strong>1. Only Women curse a lot:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, our observation indicates that women do not engage in cursing more than men. In fact, it is often observed that men curse more frequently than women.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if we assume that women curse extensively, the ultimate responsibility lies with Allah, who created women in this manner. Therefore, it is unjust for women to suffer in hell due to a trait bestowed upon them by Allah.</p>
<p><strong>2. Women are ungrateful to their husbands:</strong></p>
<p>In Western secular societies where men and women enjoy equal human rights, there is no widespread evidence of such ingratitude from women. Any perceived ungratefulness might be confined to certain Muslim societies where women are denied basic human rights, such as earning money and having independence. They are compelled to rely on their husbands for survival, often restricted from leaving their homes, and obligated to provide sex services on demand,  and their <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="20-wife-beating-muhammad-recommended-beating-one%e2%80%99s-wife-only-lightly%2c-but-he-also-made-a-law-that-allows-the-husband-to-beat-her-brutally-too%2c-even-with-bruises.81f.delaye">husbands are allowed to beat them (even brutally)</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> in every matter in the name of disciplining them. </span></p>
<p>Just look at the misogynist behaviour of Muslim men, where even it is counted as a fault of the woman if she replies loudly to her husband:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2468">2468</a>:</p>
<p>.... (Umar said): We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the <strong>upper hand over their men</strong>, so our (Meccan) women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. <strong>Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And 'Aisha told that Muhammad allowed Muslim men to<a href="20-wife-beating-muhammad-recommended-beating-one%e2%80%99s-wife-only-lightly%2c-but-he-also-made-a-law-that-allows-the-husband-to-beat-her-brutally-too%2c-even-with-bruises.81f.delaye"> beat their wives</a> even more brutally than Kafir men used to beat their wives. </p>
<p>However, Muslim men will not face punishment for going to hell due to physical violence against women, engaging in relationships with additional wives, or having intimate relations with numerous slave girls solely for their desires and not out of necessity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if ingratitude is an inherent aspect of women's creation, it is once again a direct oversight on the part of Allah. It would be unjust for women to be condemned to hell for a characteristic that Allah Himself bestowed upon them.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(3) They are deficient in good religious deeds (as compared to men):</strong></span></p>
<p>Muhammad presented the argument that women cannot pray to Allah during menstruation, and thus they are deficient in good deeds as compared to men, which will ultimately result in more women landing in hellfire as compared to men. </p>
<p>Again, women should not suffer in hellfire due to this defect in their creation by Allah.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Islamic preachers completely deny the notion that women will be in the majority in Hell</h2>
<p>The inherent sense of justice within us immediately rejects all three arguments presented by Muhammad, making it clear that they are unjust. Even Islamic preachers themselves acknowledge that these four arguments lack any justifiable basis. As a response, they have introduced a new tactic: outright denial that women would be the majority in hell.</p>
<p>Famous Islamic apologist <a href="https://www.abuaminaelias.com/women-majority-hellfire-explanation/">Abu Amina Elias</a> stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is incorrectly claimed that women are a majority of people in Hellfire according to Islam because women are of lesser piety, worth, or value than men. However, the reason women are a majority in Hellfire is because<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> women are the majority of humankind overall</strong></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, there is no concrete evidence supporting the claim that women are the majority of humankind.</p>
<p>Secondly, the traditions of Muhammad are explicit in stating that women comprise the majority in Hellfire due to perceived shortcomings in their creation, rather than merely because they are the majority among mankind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(Abu Amina continues):</em></p>
<p>... (regarding the Hadith of women being in the majority in the hellfire) The realities of the Hereafter were not revealed to the Prophet (ṣ) all at once. That he saw a minority of women in Paradise does not indicate that this is the case for all time, as many believers will enter Paradise after the Greater Intercession when sinners are taken out of Hellfire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Abu Amina's own argument contradicts itself, as it demonstrates that, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>at least <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;">initially</span></strong></span>, a majority of women will end up in hellfire due to perceived shortcomings in their creation. They are destined to endure the consequences in hell (compared to men) for sins that resulted from Allah's mistakes in their creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(Abu Amina continues):</em></p>
<p>Another tradition clarifies that there are more women than men overall, and it forbids men and women from arrogantly boasting to each other as if one gender were better than the other.</p>
<p>Muhammad ibn Sirin reported: People were boasting to each other, whether men or women would be a majority in Paradise. Abu Huraira said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say:</p>
<p>إِنَّ أَوَّلَ زُمْرَةٍ تَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ وَالَّتِي تَلِيهَا عَلَى أَضْوَإِ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيٍّ فِي السَّمَاءِ لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مِنْهُمْ زَوْجَتَانِ اثْنَتَانِ يُرَى مُخُّ سُوقِهِمَا مِنْ وَرَاءِ اللَّحْمِ وَمَا فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَعْزَبُ</p>
<p><strong>Verily, the first group to enter Paradise will have faces as bright as the full moon at night. The next group will have faces as bright as shining stars in the sky. Every man will have two wives and the marrow of their shanks would glimmer beneath their skin and there will be no one in Paradise without a wife.</strong></p>
<p>Source: Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2834, Grade: <a href="https://abuaminaelias.com/dailyhadithonline/2012/09/02/men-women-boast-majority/"><strong><em>Sahih</em></strong></a></p>
<p>Every man will have ‘two wives’ in Paradise, who will not experience worldly jealousy as they would in this life. This has been understood by some scholars to indicate that women are the majority of humankind.</p>
<p>Al-Qadi ‘Iyad comments on this tradition, saying:</p>
<p>ظَاهِرُ هَذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنَّ النِّسَاءَ أَكْثَرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَفِي الْحَدِيثِ الْآخَرِ أَنَّهُنَّ أَكْثَرُ أَهْلِ النَّارِ قَالَ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْ مَجْمُوعِ هَذَا أَنَّ النِّسَاءَ أَكْثَرُ وَلَدِ آدَمَ</p>
<p>This tradition demonstrates that women are the majority of the people of Paradise, and in another tradition that they are a majority of the people of Hellfire. What can be deduced from them together is that women are the majority of the children of Adam.</p>
<p>Source: Sharḥ al-Nawawī ‘alá Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2834</p>
<p>And Ibn Hajar writes:</p>
<p>وَاسْتَدَلَّ أَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ بِهَذَا الْحَدِيثِ عَلَى أَنَّ النِّسَاءَ فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَكْثَرُ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ كَمَا أَخْرَجَهُ مُسْلِمٌ مِنْ طَرِيقِ بن سِيرِينَ عَنْهُ وَهُوَ وَاضِحٌ</p>
<p>Abu Huraira used this tradition as evidence for there being more women in Paradise than men, as narrated from Muslim by way of Ibn Sirin; this is clear.</p>
<p>Source: Fatḥ al-Bārī 6/325</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>This is a <strong>Clear Intentional Dishonesty and Deception</strong> by Islamic preachers. The same Hadith of Abu Huraira in Sahih Bukhari makes it very clear that Abu Huraira was<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> not talking about 2 wives in paradise from the women of this world, but about two <strong>heavenly Houris</strong> as wives in paradise. Islamic preachers know this very well but still decide to mislead normal people by hiding it. </span></p>

<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The first batch (of people) who will enter Paradise will be (glittering) like the full moon, and the batch next to them will be (glittering) like the most brilliant star in the sky. Their hearts will be as if the heart of a single man, for they will have neither enmity nor jealousy amongst themselves; <strong>everyone will have two wives <span style="color: #ff0000;">from the houris</span></strong>, (who will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the bones and the flesh."</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, even if we entertain the possibility that Abu Huraira's Hadith refers to two wives from Muslim women in this world, it fails to address the fundamental concern of impoverished women going to hell and enduring suffering there due to perceived deficiencies in their creation by Allah.</p>

Given that Muhammad was a human being, it implies that he made these errors as a fallible human.</p>     </div>

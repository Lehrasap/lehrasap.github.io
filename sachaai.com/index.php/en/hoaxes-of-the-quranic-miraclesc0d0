			<description><![CDATA[<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The miracle is the most advanced form of BRAINWASHING.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For sure, millions of Muslims and Non-Muslims became extremely affected by this false propaganda of the Quranic miracles.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And at the top of the list is the so-called Quranic miracle of the body of Pharaoh.</p>
<p>According to the Quran, Allah promised to save the dead body of Pharaoh as a sign for later coming generations. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran 10:90-93) And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, "I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims ... <strong>So today We will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://sachaai.com/images/Pharoah-3.jpg" width="536" height="275" loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/Pharoah-3.jpg" class="float-none" alt="The Pharaoh’s Mummy: Uncovering Islamist Deceptions and Falsehoods" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Therefore, when the dead body of Ramesses II was found, then Muslims started claiming it was the same Pharaoh of the Moses era and claimed it to be a miracle of the Quran which promised that his dead body would be saved as a sign for later generations. </p>
<p>Maurice Bucaille (a biologist) was the first person who claimed that the Mummy of Ramesses II, is the same one about whom Allah told in the Quran that He is going to preserve his dead body. </p>
<p>But what was the proof that Maurice Bucaille provided for this claim? <br><br>Maurice Bucaille claimed that the Mummy was full of "SALT", which proves that this Mummy was the same Pharaoh who drowned in the sea, and thus this "salt" has come from that sea. <br><br>But contrary to Maurice Bucaille's claim:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(1) The Mummy of Ramesses II didn't come from the Red Sea, but it was taken out from the "Valley of Kings" (where many other Mummys of Pharaohs were buried). </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(2) And the "salt" upon the body of Ramesses II, was not from the red sea, but it was a type of salt, which is known as "Natron" and has been extensively used for the purpose of preservation. </p>
<p>Not only Ramesses II, but "all" the Mummys were preserved by using this, Natron Salt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Most Perfect Method of Mummification</b> <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy#.22Most_Perfect.22_method" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy</a><br><b>The body was further dehydrated by placing it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natron</a>, a naturally occurring salt, for seventy days</b>. Herodotus (the Researcher Scientist) insists that the body did not stay in the natron longer than seventy days. Any shorter time and the body is not completely dehydrated; any longer, and the body is too stiff to move into position for wrapping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the body of Ramesses II was not found in the red sea, but in the "Valley of Kings". </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Ramesses II</b><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br></a>Ramesses II was originally buried in the <b>tomb <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KV7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KV7</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_the_Kings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valley of the Kings</a> </b>but, because of looting, priests later transferred the body to a holding area, re-wrapped it, and placed it inside the tomb of queen Ahmose<a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmose_Inhapy"> Inhapy</a>.. Seventy-two hours later it was again moved, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tomb</a> of the high priest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinudjem_II" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinudjem II</a>. All of this is recorded in hieroglyphics on the linen covering the body.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II#cite_note-58" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[58]</a> His mummy is today in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cairo</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Museum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Egyptian Museum</a>.​</p>
<h3>There exists No Proof that Ramesses II was the same Pharaoh of the story of Moses</h3>
<p>Moreover, there has not been a single proof that Ramesses II was the same Pharaoh who existed during the era of Moses.</p>
<p>Many WRITINGs were found at the place of burial of Ramesses II, and they have a lot of details about Ramesses, about buildings, about wars, about progress in Egypt etc. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II">link</a>), but not a single hint is present there about Moses or Jews (Bani Israel).</p>
<p>And the name of the wife of Ramesses II was not "ASIYAH" (the wife of Pharoah of the Moses era). But the wife of Ramesses II was a famous queen whose name was "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertari">Nefertari</a>". He had other wives too, who were <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isetnofret">Isetnofret</a>, <a title="Maathorneferure" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maathorneferure">Maathorneferure</a>, <a title="Meritamen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritamen">Meritamen</a>, <a title="Bintanath" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bintanath">Bintanath</a>, <a title="Nebettawy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebettawy">Nebettawy</a>, and <a title="Henutmire" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henutmire">Henutmire</a>, but none of them had the name of Asiyah. </p>
<p>Therefore, there exists not a single proof that Ramesses II is the same Pharaoh of Moses era and Allah fulfilled any of his promises regarding him, but still, propaganda is so strong that millions of people have been deceived into believing this miracle of the Quran and thus they accepted Islam due to this lie.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It's also impossible for the Quranic pharaoh to be Ramses II, while he died in his 90s and was suffering from severe arthritis by that time. It's inconceivable someone as old and frail as he was chasing the Israelites into the Red Sea. Makes no sense at all.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Also, Ramses II used to pray to God for help in desperate times. But the Quranic pharaoh hated the idea of taking help from another deity.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The only reason Muslims are so desperate to force Ramses II into the story is that he is the only historic pharaoh that fits the ruling timeframe in the Quran (60+ years). So, they have no choice but to fit him in any way possible. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quran could have just named the pharaoh, a missed miracle opportunity here.</p>
<h3>The "height" of Ramesses II is only 5 feet and 7 inches</h3>
<p>Islam claims that people before Prophet Muhammad were very tall, and Adam was 60 cubits tall, and then it started gradually decreasing. But modern science is refuting this Islamic claim. The height of Ramesses II is only 5' and 7''.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The pharaoh's mummy reveals an aquiline nose and strong jaw and stands at about 1.7 metres (5 ft 7 in).​</p>
<p>Not only Ramesses II, but scientists have found thousands of human fossils who are older than the prophet Muhammad, but none of them is 30 m tall, but they all are as high as the people of today.</p>
<p>Please see the article at Islamqa.info:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20612/">https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20612/</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This hadeeth was narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Allaah created Adam and he was sixty cubits tall. Then He said, ‘Go and greet those angels and listen to how they greet you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your progeny.’ He said, ‘Al-salaamu ‘alaykum (Peace be upon you).’ They said, ‘Al-salaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allaah (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allaah).’ So they added the words ‘wa rahmat Allaah.’ And everyone who enters Paradise will be in the form of Adam. People kept on growing smaller until now.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3336; Muslim, 7092</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">According to a version narrated by Muslim: “Everyone who enters Paradise will be in the form of Adam who was sixty cubits tall. People kept growing smaller until now.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “People kept growing smaller until now,” al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (6/367): “This means that in every generation people grew shorter than the previous generation, and continued to grow shorter until the time of this ummah, then they stayed like that.”</p>]]></description>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muslims claim that modern science has proved that the roots of mountains go inside the earth like pegs. Therefore, it is a miracle of the Quran to tell it correctly 1400 years ago.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But contrary to the Muslim's claim, Quran is telling here wrong scientific facts about mountains. And this wrong view also existed among Arabs in time prior to Muhammad.</p>

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId9525"></a>The concept of mountains as pegs existed before Muhammad</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Other civilizations also had this concept, where mountains are described as pegs or similar structures. For instance, this idea is found in the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(Bible: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah%202%3A6&amp;version=NIV">John 2:6</a>):<br><strong>To the roots of the mountains,</strong> I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you, LORD my God, brought my life up from the pit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quran also introduces two scientific mistakes:</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId525183"></a><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">First Scientific Mistake in the Quran</strong>: The idea that Allah "placed" or "cast" mountains over the earth's surface.</h2>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/41/10/default.htm">41:10</a>) <br><strong>وجعل</strong> فيها رواسي <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">من </strong><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">فوقها</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>However, modern science reveals that mountains are not "placed" or "cast" onto the earth's surface. Mountains form through tectonic plate collisions. When two plates collide, one part of the crust rises to form a mountain, while the other part moves downward.</p>
<p>This process of tectonic collisions, occurring over millions of years, causes mountains to rise incrementally. Eventually, when tectonic plates begin to move apart, the mountains start to erode and, over millions of years, disappear entirely.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>Mount Everest</strong> did not exist 250 million years ago. Over time, as tectonic plates collided, Everest began to rise. Today, it's the tallest mountain in the world and continues to grow. However, there will come a time when Everest will begin to erode and ultimately vanish.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Quran makes another reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/16/15/default.htm">16:15</a>) <br>وألقى في الأرض رواسي أن تميد بكم <br>And He has <strong>cast</strong> into the earth firmly set mountains, lest it shift with you  (Translation by Sahih International)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word "cast" is derived from <strong>alqa</strong> (lam-qaf-ya), which in Arabic verb form IV frequently means "throw" or "cast." This word is used similarly in the Quran:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quran 3:44</strong> (when lots are cast using pens).</li>
<li><strong>Quran 12:10</strong> (when the Prophet Yusuf is cast into a well).</li>
<li><strong>Quran 20:20</strong> (when Moses casts down his staff, which turns into a snake).</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of "cast" suggests a misunderstanding of how mountains are formed, as though they were scattered like objects, which contradicts modern geological understanding.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId940445"></a><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Second Scientific Mistake in the Quran</strong>: The claim that Allah created mountains on the <strong>second day</strong> of the creation of the heavens and the earth</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quran claims that Allah had already created the mountains on the 2nd day of creation. </p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(Quran 41:9-11)<br>Say, "Do you indeed disbelieve in He who <strong>created the earth in two days</strong> and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds.<strong> And He placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface,</strong> and He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance in (next) four days without distinction - for [the information] of those who ask. Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, "Come [into being], willingly or by compulsion." They said, "We have come willingly."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And Hadith made it clearer that 2nd day of creation was Sunday when the mountains were created by Allah. </p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">

</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scientific Rebuttal:</span></strong></p>
<p>Islam's claim that mountains were created on the second day of the creation of the heavens and the earth is scientifically inaccurate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Earth formed approximately 9 billion years</strong> after the universe (heavens) came into existence.</li>
<li>Initially, Earth was composed of gases and had a molten surface. It took <strong>billions of years</strong> to cool and solidify into a solid form.</li>
<li>Even after the Earth became solid, it took additional <strong>billions of years</strong> for tectonic plates to form, which then led to the creation of mountains through tectonic activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, mountains constantly change. Old mountains erode and disappear, while new ones continue to form through the ongoing process of tectonic plate movement.</p>
<p>Muhammad, unaware of these scientific facts, claimed that mountains were placed on the second day of creation, which contradicts modern geological knowledge.</p>
<h2 class="_1WODZhR-x-fbMu3MOL9cH1"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId877572"></a>Other Types of Mountains Without Roots in the Earth</h2>
<div class="_1WODZhR-x-fbMu3MOL9cH1">
<p>While one type of mountain forms due to the collision of tectonic plates, other types, such as <strong>volcanic mountains</strong>, are formed when <strong>lava</strong> erupts from inside the Earth. As this lava cools, it creates large mountains. These <strong>lava mountains</strong> have no deep roots in the Earth that could be considered pegs.</p>
<p>Questions to Consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad explain that mountains form when tectonic plates collide?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad describe that mountains start small and rise over time due to earthquakes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad mention that mountains eventually erode and disappear?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad state that there was initially one large continent (Pangaea), which later split into seven continents due to tectonic plate movement?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad explain that earthquakes are caused by the collision of tectonic plates?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No, instead, the writer of the Quran/Muhammad claimed that <strong>Allah sends earthquakes as a punishment</strong> for disobedience.</p>
<p>The Quran fails to address any of these scientifically supported facts but instead focuses on one assertion: that mountains act as pegs. This belief was already common among the pagans of the time due to the visible appearance of mountains. Yet, some Muslims today claim it as an undeniable miracle of the Quran.</p>

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId186021"></a>Excuses by Muslim apologists:</h2>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId280315"></a>Excuse: The Quran is a Book of Guidance, Not Science</h3>
<p>Muslim apologists often argue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Allah has mentioned no science in the Quran. Therefore, it cannot be judged in light of modern science. The Quran is a book of guidance, not a book of science."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response</strong></span>:</p>
<p>When the writer of the Quran (i.e., Muhammad) begins to describe <strong>the story of creation</strong>, he inevitably enters the realm of science. By doing so, these descriptions must be evaluated in light of the <strong>scientific facts</strong> that modern science has discovered.</p>
<p>If the Quran makes claims about natural phenomena or the process of creation, it opens itself up to scrutiny based on scientific knowledge. Therefore, while it may be primarily a book of guidance, any <strong>scientific assertions</strong> made within it should still be judged against the established facts discovered through modern science.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId676261"></a>Excuse: The Quran could not be judged in light of science while science is 'UNRELIABLE'</h3>
<p>Muslim apologist writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Science isn't an accurate measure of the validity of the Qur'an since it's always changing and is not always absolute truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response</strong></span>:</p>
<p>It's important to differentiate between <strong>scientific hypotheses</strong> and <strong>scientific facts</strong>. Hypotheses may evolve as new evidence emerges, but once something becomes a <strong>scientific fact</strong>, it is unlikely to change. For example, the fact that the Earth is spherical is a <strong>scientific fact</strong> that will not be overturned. Even if the Quran repeatedly states that the Earth is flat, it cannot stand against this established fact.</p>
<p>Similarly, the formation of mountains due to the <strong>collision of tectonic plates</strong> has reached the stage of being a <strong>scientific fact</strong> and will not change. So, even if the Quran states many times that Allah placed mountains from above, it cannot stand against this established scientific fact.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId820809"></a>Excuse: Non-Muslims Provide False Translations</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A Muslim apologist argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> Non-Muslims often choose one translation out of many, which can lead to misunderstandings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The issue is not about choosing one translation over many, but about providing the <strong>correct</strong> translation. It is well-known that some Muslim translators distort the meaning to protect the Quran from criticism or align it with modern scientific views. Many translations reflect the translator's personal opinions rather than the original meaning.</p>
<p>We have provided <strong>word-for-word translations</strong> directly from Muslim sources, leaving no room for misinterpretation. If Muslim apologists claim these translations are incorrect, they are welcome to refute them with proof.

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId700921"></a>Questions That Arise in a Neutral Mind About the Quranic Story of the Creation of Mountains</h2>
<p>While Muslim apologists are often unwavering in their beliefs—so much so that even if Muhammad himself appeared and admitted to fabricating the Quran, they might still not accept it.</p>
<p>However, a neutral, open-minded reader of the Quranic stories is likely to have several important questions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Question: Why Discuss the Creation of Mountains?</strong></span></p>
<p>Muslim apologists argue that when the Quran says mountains were "placed or cast from above," it's because the people of that time didn't understand complex scientific concepts like <strong>plate tectonics</strong>. But this leads to a basic question:</p>
<p>If the people of that time couldn't grasp the real scientific processes behind mountain formation, then <strong>what was the point of telling them this story</strong>?</p>
<p>Why would Allah include a description of mountain creation that could confuse them, especially when He skipped explaining the creation of things like deserts, rivers, and oceans? It seems unnecessary to introduce a concept that wasn’t relevant to their understanding.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Second Question: Could the Story Have Been Told More Clearly?</strong></span></p>
<p>There were <strong>better ways</strong> the Quran could have communicated this idea without conflicting with modern science. For instance, the Quran could have simply said:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Mountains were formed by Allah to stabilize the earth."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This statement removes the problematic imagery of mountains being placed from above while still delivering the intended message.</p>
<p>Another alternative might have been:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Allah caused the mountains to rise from the earth, stabilizing it."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, the Quran could have <strong>avoided</strong> the topic altogether, as it did with other natural formations like deserts and rivers.</p>
<p>These options would have made the message more accessible to people of <strong>all times</strong>, without contradicting scientific facts. It would be difficult for Muslim apologists to argue that these versions are not clearer or more accurate than the ones found in the Quran.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third Question: What Would a False Prophet Say?</strong></span></p>
<p>A neutral thinker might also consider this: <strong>If Muhammad were a false prophet</strong>, making up these revelations, would his version of the story have been any different?</p>
<p>Probably not. A false prophet, trying to show the <strong>power of Allah</strong>, would likely come up with the exact kind of statements we find in the Quran—grand claims like Allah "placing or casting" mountains onto the earth.</p>
<p>This kind of language would have impressed his audience at the time, but now, we know it <strong>contradicts</strong> the scientific explanation of how mountains form through <strong>tectonic plate movement</strong> over millions of years.</p>
<p>These questions point out significant inconsistencies and missed opportunities in the Quranic story of mountain creation. The story could have been told in a much clearer and more scientifically sound way, without losing its message. Instead, what we find is a description that feels more like an attempt to showcase divine power, but one that ultimately clashes with established scientific facts. This suggests that the verses may have been crafted to impress, rather than to convey timeless truth.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quranic Claim That Its Verses Are Clear and Easy to Understand Becomes False</h3>
<p>The Quran makes several claims about its clarity and accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its verses are <em>"easy to understand"</em> (Quran 54:17).</li>
<li>Its verses are <em>"clear,"</em> <em>"manifest,"</em> and meant for <em>"guidance"</em> (Quran 27:1-2).</li>
<li>It was revealed in the Arabic language so that people could comprehend it (Quran 12:2).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these claims become questionable when we encounter verses that contradict <strong>scientific facts</strong>. These verses are often <strong>vague</strong>, leading to <strong>contradictions</strong> not only between science and scripture but also among Muslims themselves. Many Muslims interpret these verses differently, and none seem to reach a consensus on their true meaning.</p>
<p>Muslim apologists often introduce <strong>confusing explanations</strong> to justify these contradictions. Ironically, this very confusion serves as evidence that the Quran’s verses are neither as clear nor as understandable as claimed. If the Quran were truly easy to understand, there wouldn't be such widespread disagreement or the need for complicated interpretations.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId177493"></a>Apologist Argument: Divine Days vs. Earthly Days</h3>
<p>Muslim apologists often argue that the days of creation described in the Quran are not equivalent to Earthly days. They claim these "days" were unspecified periods of time beyond human comprehension. Therefore, they argue that the six days mentioned in the Quran should not be taken literally.</p>
<h4>Key Questions for a Neutral Observer:</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1. Why Specify the Duration if It’s Unfathomable?</strong></span></p>
<p>If these divine days are beyond human understanding, what was the purpose of specifying that creation occurred over six days? If the length of these days is inconceivable, why not simply describe the creation without referring to a specific time frame? This would avoid confusion and prevent misinterpretation of the time span involved.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Can Humans Understand Long Periods?</strong></span></p>
<p>Modern science indicates that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The universe is about <strong>13.8 billion years old</strong>.</li>
<li>Earth formed around <strong>4.5 billion years ago</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans are capable of grasping such extensive periods. If the Quran intended to convey a long creation period, it could have provided an accurate description that aligns with scientific understanding, making it accessible and comprehensible.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Is the Concept of 'Unspecified Time' Valid?</strong></span></p>
<p>The argument that divine days are unspecified is challenged by verses that quantify time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quran 22:47</strong>: <em>"A Day with your Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning."</em></li>
<li><strong>Quran 32:5</strong>: <em>"He rules all affairs from the heavens to the earth, and then they ascend to Him on a Day the length of which is a thousand years of your reckoning."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These verses suggest that one divine day equals a thousand Earth years. This interpretation has led some to believe that each creation day lasted a thousand years. However, even this interpretation falls short. Six divine days equate to only <strong>6,000 years</strong>, which still does not align with the billions of years required by modern scientific evidence for the universe's creation.</p>
<p>Thus Sahaba (i.e. companions) believed in it that one day of creation was equal to 1000 years of our reckoning.</p>
<p>Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of this verse (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=22&amp;tAyahNo=47&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic"> </span>قال ابن أبي حاتم حدثنا الحسن بن عرفة، حدثني عبدة بن سليمان عن محمد بن عمرو عن أبي سلمة عن أبي هريرة أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال " يدخل فقراء المسلمين الجنة قبل الأغنياء بنصف يوم خمسمائة عام " ورواه الترمذي والنسائي من حديث الثوري عن محمد بن عمرو به، وقال الترمذي حسن صحيح. وقد رواه ابن جرير عن أبي هريرة موقوفاً، فقال حدثني يعقوب، حدثنا ابن علية، حدثنا سعيد الجريري عن أبي نضرة عن سمير بن نهار قال قال أبو هريرة يدخل فقراء المسلمين الجنة قبل الأغنياء بمقدار نصف يوم، قلت وما مقدار نصف يوم؟ قال أو ما تقرأ القرآن؟ قلت بلى، قال { وَإِنَّ يَوْماً عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ }. وقال أبو داود في آخر كتاب الملاحم من سننه حدثنا عمرو بن عثمان، حدثنا أبو المغيرة، حدثنا صفوان عن شريح بن عبيد عن سعد بن أبي وقاص عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه قال " إني لأرجو أن لا تعجز أمتي عند ربها أن يؤخرهم نصف يوم " قيل لسعد وما نصف يوم؟ قال خمسمائة سنة. وقال ابن أبي حاتم حدثنا أحمد بن سنان، حدثنا عبد الرحمن بن مهدي عن إسرائيل عن سماك، عن عكرمة عن ابن عباس { وَإِنَّ يَوْماً عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ } قال من الأيام التي خلق الله فيها السموات والأرض. ورواه ابن جرير عن ابن بشار عن ابن المهدي، وبه قال مجاهد وعكرمة، ونص عليه أحمد بن حنبل في كتاب الرد على الجهمية، وقال مجاهد هذه الآية كقوله{ يُدَبِّرُ ٱلاَْمْرَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ إِلَى ٱلاَْرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ فِى يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ } السجدة 5.<br><br></p>
<p>Rasool Allah told that the poor people will enter paradise <strong>half a day</strong> before the rich people, which means<strong> 500 years before the rich people (while whole day is equal to 1000 years of people's reckoning)</strong>. al-Tirmidhi and al-Nisai etc recorded it and al-Tirmidhi said that this tradition is<strong> 'Hasan Sahih' (i.e. authentic according to al-Tirmidhi)</strong>. In another tradition, it was asked from Abu Hurayrah, how long is this half day? He replied: "Didn't you read the Quran?" I said: "Yes." <strong>Upon that he recited verse 22:47</strong> ... Companion S'ad was asked: "How long is this half day." He replied: <strong>"500 years"</strong>. Ibn Abbas recited this verse and said that <strong>this is the length of those 6 days, in which Allah created the heavens and the earth</strong> (Ibn Jarir). While Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal described it in clearer words in his book "Refutation of al-Jahmia". Mujjahid said that this verse is similar to verse 5 of Surah al-Sajdah [(Quran 32:5) He rules (all) affairs from the heavens to the earth: in the end will (all affairs) go up to Him, on a Day, <strong>the space whereof will be (as) a thousand years of your reckoning</strong>.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the explanation that divine days differ from Earthly days does not fully resolve the issue. If the Quran intended to describe a timeframe that humans could understand, it could have done so in a way consistent with modern science. Instead, the Quran's references to specific time spans create inconsistencies with established scientific knowledge, leaving apologists with a challenging task of reconciling these differences.</p>
<h4>Historical and Cultural Context (An Answer by Chat GPT)</h4>
<p>Similar concepts can be found in other ancient civilizations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Biblical References:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Bible</strong>, particularly in Psalms and Job, mountains are sometimes described as foundational or stabilizing elements. For example, <strong>Job 28:9</strong> describes mining through mountains, reflecting their perceived stability and immovability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ancient Greek Beliefs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient Greeks, influenced by early philosophers and poets, often saw mountains as the pillars or supports of the Earth. For instance, Homer’s epics sometimes depict mountains as crucial, supportive features of the terrestrial world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ancient Hindu Texts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hindu cosmology also contains references to mountains playing significant roles in the structure of the world. For example, Mount Meru is often depicted as the central axis of the universe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p>The Quran's depiction of mountains as "pegs" or stabilizers is not unique and reflects a common ancient understanding of mountains as stabilizing features of the Earth. This interpretation is consistent with similar descriptions found in various ancient cultures, where mountains were often seen as crucial, immovable parts of the world. However, this ancient perspective does not align with modern geological science, which provides a more complex and dynamic explanation of mountain formation and tectonics.</p>
<p>The claim of a Quranic miracle based on this description overlooks the fact that many ancient civilizations shared similar views. These interpretations, while historically interesting, do not necessarily provide evidence of advanced scientific knowledge in the Quran beyond what was common in the ancient world.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Islamists claim that the Big Bang Theory was told in the Quran. They present the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/21/30/">21:30</a>:</p>
<p><span>اَوَ لَمۡ یَرَ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡۤا اَنَّ السَّمٰوٰتِ وَ الۡاَرۡضَ کَانَتَا <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>رَتۡقًا</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>فَفَتَقۡنٰہُمَا</strong></span> ؕ</span></p>
<p><span>ARE, THEN, they who are bent on denying the truth not aware that the heavens and the earth were <strong>[once] one single entity</strong> [Arabic: <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>رَتۡقًا</strong></span> Ratqan], which We then <strong>parted asunder</strong> [Arabic: <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>فَفَتَقۡنٰہُمَا</strong></span>] <em>[Translated by <a title="More information for The Message of the Quran by Muhammad Asad" href="https://www.islamawakened.com/index.php/qur-an/translation-descriptions-in-progress/75-muhammad-asad-translation-the-message-of-the-qur-an">Muhammad Asad</a>]</em></span></p>
<p><span>Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth<strong> were ˹once˺ one mass</strong> then We <strong>split them apart</strong>? <em>[Translated by -Dr. Mustafa Khattab]</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>The problems with this Islamist claim is:</span></p>
<h2><strong>(1) The Heavens and the Earth Were Not a Single Entity, but Created Separately, but put adjacent to each other:</strong></h2>
<p>The translation of the word <strong>"ratqan"</strong> (رَتْقًا) as "one single entity" or "one mass" is dishonesty by the Muslim Translators.</p>
<p>According to <strong>Lane's Lexicon</strong>, the word <strong>"ratqan"</strong> means "closed up" or "sewn up" (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume3/00000193.pdf">Lane's Lexicon, p. 1027 رَتْقًا</a>). Thus, the verse does not<span> imply that the earth and the heaven were a homogenous mass or state as one single entity.</span></p>
<p>The verse suggests that the heavens and the earth were <strong>joined together initially</strong> at the time of creation, and were later <strong>separated</strong>. It does not imply that they were originally one undifferentiated mass.</p>
<p>The correct translation of this verse is: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran 21:30: "<span>Do not those who deny the truth see that the heavens and the earth were joined together and that We then split them asunder?"</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>Muhammad's hadith</strong> supports the understanding that the heavens and the earth were created as distinct, separate entities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3191">Sahih Bukhari, 3191</a>:</span></p>
<p>... He said, "First of all, there was nothing but Allah, and (then He created His Throne). His throne was over the water, and He wrote everything in the Book (in the Heaven) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>created the Heavens and the Earth</strong></span>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it was as a case of one entity/one mass, then Muhammad would have instead said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" ... His throne was over the water, and He wrote everything in the Book (in the Heaven) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>created one homogenous mass, from which later the Heavens and the Earth were created</strong></span>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept was present in multiple cultures (as we will see later in this article) that both the Earth and the Heaven were created separately, but put adjacent to each other initially in the beginning. Muhammad copied this exact concept. </p>
<p>Ibn Kathir wrote in the commentary of this verse (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=21&amp;tAyahNo=30&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Do they not see that the Heavens and the Earth were ratqan, <strong>meaning that all of them were connected (muttaṣil) to each other, touching (mutalāṣiq) and piled up (mutarākim) on top of each other at the beginning of the affair. </strong>Then He separated this (the heaven) from that (the earth), so He made the heavens to be seven and the earth to be seven and separated the lowest heaven and the earth with air.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>(2) The Separation Does Not Mean "Explosion"</h2>
<p>The Arabic word <span><span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>فَفَتَقۡنٰہُمَا</strong></span></span> <span><em>fafataqnahuma</em></span> is also an evidence that they were not one single entity/one mass when they were separated. </p>
<p>The word <span><span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>فَفَتَقۡنٰہُمَا </strong></span></span>is a <strong>DUAL</strong> object pronoun (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=21&amp;verse=30">link</a>). </p>
<p><span>Thus, the verse states that "We separated <strong>them</strong>" (dual pronoun 'huma'), not "We separated <strong>it</strong>", thereby indicating that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The Earth and heaven were <strong>two distinct entities</strong> even <strong>before</strong> separation. </span></li>
<li><span>and they stayed as only <strong>two distinct entities</strong> <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>AFTER</strong></span> the separation too<strong>. </strong></span>This indicates that the verse is talking about the <strong>separation</strong> of <span style="font-size: 1rem;">two entities</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, not the splitting of a single mass into multiple parts due to any <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>EXPLOSION</strong></span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there is <strong>no mention of an explosion</strong> in this verse or elsewhere in the Quran. The word <strong>"fataq"</strong> (فَتَقَ) means to <strong>split</strong>, <strong>separate</strong>, or <strong>unfold</strong>, but it does not imply a violent event such as an explosion. The Quran only speaks of the <strong>heaven and earth being separated</strong> in an orderly, controlled manner, not a chaotic or destructive event like the <strong>Big Bang</strong>, which involved the rapid expansion of matter and energy.</p>
<h2><span>(3) In the Quranic Creation Story, the Stars Did Not Originate from the Heavens</span></h2>
<p>According to the Quranic narrative, the universe consists of <strong>seven heavens</strong>, and the <strong>stars are confined only to the first heaven</strong> (the lowest one, also referred to as the heaven of our world), and were added <strong>later</strong> in the creation process. This explicitly implies that the <strong>other six heavens</strong> do not contain any stars.</p>
<p>In <strong>Quran 41:9-12</strong>, it is stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/41/12/default.htm">Quran 41:12</a>:</p>
<p>Then He formed the heaven into <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seven Heavens</span></strong></span> in two days, assigning to each its mandate. <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>And We adorned (only) the lowest (1st) heaven (i.e. the heaven of our Earth) with ˹stars like˺ lamps </strong>˹for beauty˺ and for protection</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse clarifies that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stars neither originated from the heavens nor from the earth, but they were separately created later and put under the <strong>first heaven</strong>.</li>
<li style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0); background-color: rgb(251, 238, 184);"><strong>The formation of 7 heavens and keeping the stars only under the 1st heaven refers to an "<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">Intelligent Design</span>". While the Big Bang was an "<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">EXPLOSION</span>", which can never create such an intelligent design, as the Quran describes.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>(4) The Earth Formed 9 Billion Years After the Big Bang</h2>
<p>The Quranic claim is scientifically untenable, as Earth came into existence approximately 9 billion years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>The <strong>Big Bang</strong> occurred around <strong>13.8 billion years ago</strong>, marking the formation of the universe, including stars and galaxies. Over time, many of the early stars underwent cycles of formation and destruction, with some exploding in supernovae, releasing the elements necessary for new stars and planets to form. Eventually, our <strong>planet Earth</strong> formed <strong>4.5 billion years ago</strong> from the remnants of these earlier stars.</p>
<p>This creates a <strong>9 billion-year gap</strong> between the creation of the universe (heavens) and the formation of Earth, meaning they were not formed simultaneously. The Quranic description of the heavens and Earth being separated from each other is therefore incompatible with modern science, which shows that they were never "together" in the way the verse suggests.</p>
<h2>(5) The Quran only repeated ancient stories about Creation where the earth and the sky were adjacent in the beginning</h2>
<p>Many ancient cultures shared myths or stories about the heavens and the earth being united and then separated. Here’s a list of some of the earlier cultures with such beliefs:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Mesopotamian (Sumerian/Babylonian) Mythology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> In Sumerian mythology, the heavens and earth were united as one before being separated by the gods.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> <em>"Gilgamesh and the Netherworld"</em> describes how the heavens and earth were initially united, only to be later split apart by the gods.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Egyptian Mythology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> The sky goddess <strong>Nut</strong> and the earth god <strong>Geb</strong> were initially together in a close embrace before they were forcibly separated by the god <strong>Shu</strong> to create space for the world to exist.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Nut and Geb’s separation is often depicted in Egyptian art, where the sky arches above the earth, with the air god Shu holding them apart.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Greek Mythology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> In ancient Greek cosmology, <strong>Uranus</strong> (the sky) and <strong>Gaia</strong> (the earth) were initially together, with Uranus lying over Gaia. They were later separated by their son, <strong>Cronus</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Euripides</strong>, a Greek tragedian, recounted the story of how the heavens and earth were one form but later separated, bringing forth all life.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Hindu Cosmology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> In Hindu creation stories, the heavens and earth were considered unified before being separated by divine action.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> In some versions, the god <strong>Prajapati</strong> or <strong>Indra</strong> is responsible for separating the heavens and the earth to create the world as we know it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Norse Mythology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> In Norse mythology, the cosmos began as a void called <strong>Ginnungagap</strong>, and from this void, the giant <strong>Ymir</strong> was formed. Later, the gods separated the primordial elements to create the heavens and the earth.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The gods formed the heavens from Ymir’s skull and the earth from his body, separating these realms in the process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. <strong>Maori (Polynesian) Mythology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> In Maori mythology, <strong>Rangi</strong> (the sky) and <strong>Papa</strong> (the earth) were closely bound together, and their children, the gods, separated them to allow life and light to flourish.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The god <strong>Tāne</strong> pushed the sky and earth apart, creating the world between them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. <strong>Chinese Mythology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> In ancient Chinese myths, <strong>Pangu</strong>, the creator god, separated the heavens and the earth, which were initially mixed together in chaos.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Pangu is said to have held up the heavens and pressed down the earth to separate them, thereby creating the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. <strong>Native American Myths (Various Tribes)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> Some Native American tribes, such as the <strong>Hopi</strong> and <strong>Iroquois</strong>, tell stories of a primordial union of the heavens and earth, followed by their separation to form the current world.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> In <strong>Iroquois</strong> mythology, <strong>Sky Woman</strong> descended from the heavens, and the earth was formed below her.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. <strong>Japanese Mythology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> In Shinto belief, the heavens and earth were originally merged in a chaotic form until they were separated by the primordial gods.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The creation myth describes how the first gods, <strong>Izanagi</strong> and <strong>Izanami</strong>, shaped the earth and heavens, separating them as they created the islands of Japan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. <strong>African Mythology (Dogon People of Mali)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myth:</strong> The Dogon people of West Africa believed that the earth and sky were once a single entity before being separated to form the cosmos.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> According to Dogon mythology, the earth and sky were separated by the actions of the supreme god <strong>Amma</strong>, leading to the creation of the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>These myths reveal a widespread and ancient belief across many cultures that the earth and heavens were originally united and were later separated, often through divine intervention. The Quran’s account of the heavens and earth being joined and then separated echoes these older cultural traditions, demonstrating that this was a common theme in human mythology long before the advent of Islam</p>

			<title>Did the Quran Really State that the Universe Is Expanding?</title>
			<link>https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/did-the-quran-really-state-that-universe-is-expanding</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/did-the-quran-really-state-that-universe-is-expanding</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">According to science, the universe has been continuously expanding. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Modern Muslim apologists (like Zakir Naik) recently distorted the translation of Quranic Verse 51:47 and claimed that Allah already told the continuous expansion of the universe in the Quran. Their modern distorted translation is as under:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 51:47) وَالسَّمَاءَ بَنَيْنَاهَا بِأَيْدٍ <u><strong>وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ</strong></u><br />Translations: </p>
<p dir="ltr">(Muhammad Asad) "It is we who have built the universe with [our creative] power; and, verily, <u>it is we who are steadily expanding it."</u> (Harun Yahya used this translation in his book. <a href="http://www.creationofuniverse.com/html/bigbang_04.html">Link</a>)</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Hilali/Khan) With power did We construct the heaven. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Verily, We are Able to extend the vastness of space thereof</span>. (Zakir Naik used this translation in his book. <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=r6_EAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12&amp;lpg=PT12&amp;dq=51:47+quran+and+the+modern+science+by+zakir+naik&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-acEUDOujh&amp;sig=ACfU3U3N-nrZd1HT2y5Z891R54t8-fh8Ng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5zqKx6NziAhXuMewKHY78CrcQ6AEwDXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=51%3A47%20quran%20and%20the%20modern%20science%20by%20zakir%20naik&amp;f=false">Link</a>)</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Khalifa) "We constructed the sky with our hands, <u>and we will continue to expand it."</u></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"> This is clearly a heavily distorted translation of the last 2 words of this verse (i.e. وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ<strong>)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">وَإِنَّا  means "and indeed, We (Allah)"</p>
<p dir="ltr">لَمُوسِعُونَ means "are the Expander".</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, the correct translation of this verse is:</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 51:47) <i>And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> We (Allah) are [its] expander</strong></span>.</i></p>
<p dir="ltr">The term “lamūsi‘ūn” in this verse is a "<strong>NOUN</strong>"  and not a "<strong>Verb</strong>", and it <strong>describes "God" and not the "heaven"</strong> (i.e. the term “lamūsi‘ūn” means "God is the Expander", and not "the Universe is Expanding". </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Word by Word Translation and Grammar provided by Corpus Quran:</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Corpus Quran is a Muslim project, where that provided the word-by-word translation and grammar of the Quran. Let us see what they are saying (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=51&amp;verse=47">link</a>):</p>

<h4>Verse (51:47)</h4>
<p class="verseImage"><a href="http://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=51&amp;verse=47#(51:47:1)"><img src="http://www.everyayah.com/data/images_png/51_47.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><b>Sahih International</b>: <i>And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> We are [its] expander</strong></span>.</i></p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the "literal" meaning of the word "<em>mūsi‘" .</em> However, in Quran, this word and its derivatives have been used in the meanings of "<strong>Encompassing"</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Look at the following verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 6.80) My Lord wasi‘a (encompasses) everything in His knowledge. </p>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 7.89) Our Lord wasi‘a (encompasses) everything in His knowledge. </p>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 20.98) [He] wasi‘a (encompasses) everything in His knowledge. </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Also see verse 65:12, where directly the word of "<strong>احاط</strong>" (encompass) has been used instead of "wasi'a"</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 65:12) وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ <strong>أَحَاطَ</strong> بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا<br />Translation: and that God encompasses everything in knowledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">So, then verse 51.47 must be understood as follows:<strong> "And the heaven We built it with might and We lamūsi‘ūn (encompasses it)."</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This verse confirms that heaven is completely within and under God’s control. There is no reference whatsoever to the expansion of heaven. The term “<em>lamūsi‘ūn</em>” <strong>describes God, not heaven</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">None of the earlier translators ever gave this meaning of "Present perfect continuous" like modern Islam apologists. Let us see some of the earlier translations: </p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Yusuf Ali: With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: <em>for it is We Who create the vastness of space</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pickthal: We have built the heaven with might, <em>and We it is Who make the vast extent (thereof)</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shakir: And the heaven, We raised it high with power, <em>and most surely We are the makers of things ample</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">H/K/Saheeh: And the heaven We constructed with strength, <em>and indeed, We are [its] expander</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Also, see the meaning of wasi‘a in this arabic-english dictionary <a href="http://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/وسع/">here</a>. </p>
<h3 dir="ltr">The wrong Translation of Modern Muslims is exposed in the next verse of 51:48</h3>
<p dir="ltr">A lie has no feet. Modern Islam apologists got exposed in the next verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 51:48) وَالْأَرْضَ فَرَشْنَاهَا فَنِعْمَ الْمَاهِدُونَ<br />Translation: We have spread out the earth; how excellent a spreader/smoother We are!</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">In this verse, the word الْمَاهِدُونَ (spreader/smoother) has exactly the same grammar (Active Participle Form I) as the word لَمُوسِعُونَ (i.e. expander) in the previous verse.<br />If we have to follow the Muslim logic of the previous verse, then the translation of the next verse becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Quran 51:48) We have spread out the earth; <strong>and We are still steadily spreading/smoothing it</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Let us see the translation and grammar at Corpus Quran (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170915115710/http://corpus.quran.com/wordmorphology.jsp?location=(51:48:4)">link</a>):</p>

<h4>Verse (51:48)</h4>
<p class="first">The analysis above refers to the 48th verse of chapter 51 (<i class="ab">sūrat l-dhāriyāt</i>):</p>
<p class="verseImage"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170915115710/http://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=51&amp;verse=48#(51:48:1)"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20170915115710im_/http://www.everyayah.com/data/images_png/51_48.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><b>Sahih International</b>: <i>And the earth We have spread out, and excellent is the preparer.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Obviously, even these modern Quran translators also don't believe that Allah is still spreading/smoothing the earth. Therefore, here they didn't translate it as they did in the previous verse. Let us see how they translate this next verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">(Hilali/Kan 51:48) And We have spread out the earth, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>how Excellent Spreader (thereof) are We!</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">(Asad 51:48) And the earth have We spread out wide - and how well have We ordered it!</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Khalifa 51:48) And we made the earth habitable; a perfect design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">So, you can see the wickedness of these Translators and Islam apologists like Zakir Naik and Harun Yahya. </p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Universe consists of "Space", while Quranic Sky is a solid Dome which could not expand</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Actually, Islam is not only wrong, but it is "so much wrong" that one gets confused as to where to start explaining its wrong claims. </p>
<p dir="ltr">According to science, the universe consists of space and galaxies are travelling away from each other in this space thus it is considered an expansion of the universe. </p>
<p dir="ltr">But according to the writer of the Quran: </p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>There is no mention of the universe, but it talks only about the earth and the 7 skies. <br />Islam apologists of today dishonestly distort the meaning of the Quranic word "Sama" (i.e. Sky), and claim it to be "universe". </li>
<li>But according to the writer of the Quran, these 7 Skies are "solid" Domes, where prophets are residing along with their people. </li>
<li>And it is impossible for a solid Dome to expand like the universe is expanding due to the travelling of galaxies in space. </li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">No mention of the continuous expansion of the Universe in 800,000 Ahadith of Islam</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Billions of Muslims read the whole Quran during the last 14 centuries, but none of them found continuous expansion of the universe in the Quran. <br />But in recent times, when scientific advancement was made and people came to know about the expansion of the universe, then the Islam apologists came into action and forcefully extracted the expansion of the universe from the Quran by distortion. <br />Muslims have more than 800,000 Ahadith, but again for the last 1400 years, nobody found expansion of the universe in them too.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">According to Nathan Sivin, this was already common teaching in the third century B.C., i.e. it is apparently documented even earlier. We find that this correspondence is also part of (at least some forms of) Buddhism (Buddha lived roughly 500 B.C.).</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">***</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body has 360 joints. It is just a random number that doctors like to regurgitate since it was arbitrarily decided over 2000 years ago by Chinese doctors that this number is cool.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just to give an example of how no one actually knows how many joints we have (since the definition of joints itself has no consensus), here are a few sources...</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In the book Anatomy and Physiology, written by Ph.D. in Biological Sciences Blair Fraser, and Professor Emeritus of Biology Bev Lott, it is mentioned that the human body <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">has 400 joints</strong>:</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In a paper published last year in the prestigious National Centre for Biotechnology Information, it is also claimed that the number of joints in the human body is <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">around 300</strong>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8551718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8551718/</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The orthopedic institute of henderson claim the human body has <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">between 250-350 joints</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.oihnv.com/blog/different-types-of-joints-common-problems" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.oihnv.com/blog/different-types-of-joints-common-problems</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A children's website run by the Arthritis &amp; Osteoporosis organisation of Western Australia also teaches a similar <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">range of 250-350 joints</strong>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="http://www.bonesandjoints.com.au/students/students-joints/where-do-we-have-joints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://www.bonesandjoints.com.au/students/students-joints/where-do-we-have-joints/</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">On 'Ask a Biologist', a QnA website hosted by The Palaeontological Association, a question about joints is answered by Professor David Wynick from University of Bristol, where he once again gives a similar <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">range from 250-350 joints</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/answers/viewtopic.php?id=3009" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/answers/viewtopic.php?id=3009</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Dr Nikota Vizniak claims there are around <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">472 joints in the human body</strong>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://youtu.be/3EGwlh2XHRg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://youtu.be/3EGwlh2XHRg</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Also, According to Dr. Nikita A. Vizniak, the number 360 is outdated. Instead, he proposes ~472 joints as the answer and asserts that he and his team are the first in history to accurately name all the joints. On the product page of his book Muscle Manual, it states: “Multi-disciplinary Peer Reviewed (AT, DC, DO, LMT, MD, ND, PhD, PT, RMT)”. In a YouTube video, Dr. Nikita displays the full list of joints that are found in his book (page 16) and goes through them. Link to the video: <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EGwlh2XHRg&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EGwlh2XHRg&amp;t=2s</a><br />Notably, even those who went with 360 as the answer in the past do not claim it is a fixed number, which would seem to contradict Muhammad who said "Every one of the children of Adam has been created with three hundred and sixty joints." and “A human being has three hundred and sixty joints”. "Although you might assume that the number of joints in the adult human body is fixed (at 360), this is not the case. The manual physician needs to be aware that up to one patient in 20 will have been born with extra or fewer joints than normal. This is particularly true in and around the vertebral column (…)" [Essential Physics for Manual Medicine, Martin Young, 2009, p. 73].</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Hadith also mentions "every human among the children of Adam..." so this means that both boys and men have 360 joints, but this is not the case, only adults have 360 joints, not children.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Quran describes Gender determination by Male Sperm</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/quran-describes-gender-determination-by-male-sperm</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Islam apologist, Dr Al Zeiny writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until fairly recently, it was thought that a baby's sex was determined by the mother's cells. Or at least, it was believed that the sex was determined by the male and female cells together. The Quran is the only ancient book that states that sex is determined by the (male) sperms.</p>
<p>"He has created both sexes, male and female from a drop of a (male) sperm which has been ejected." (The Qur'an, 53:45-46)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This claim is repeated by Dr. Zakir Naik in his book "The Quran and Modern Science" (<a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=r6_EAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43&amp;lpg=PT43&amp;dq=Zakir+Naik+The+sex+of+a+fetus+is+determined+by+the+nature+of+the+sperm+and+not+the+ovum.+The+sex+of+the+child,+whether+female+or+male,+depends+on+whether+the+23rd+pair+of+chromosomes+is+XX+or+XY+respectively.+Primarily+sex+determination+occurs+at+fertilization+and+depends+upon+the+type+of+sex+chromosome+in+the+sperm+that+fertilizes+an+ovum.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-b8I0uPqfn&amp;sig=ACfU3U3GgPWg2O-wEdHLZ6GvX7At4Dy9jw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixjcCDkrjxAhXqgv0HHfCRDukQ6AF6BAgjEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Zakir%20Naik%20The%20sex%20of%20a%20fetus%20is%20determined%20by%20the%20nature%20of%20the%20sperm%20and%20not%20the%20ovum.%20The%20sex%20of%20the%20child%2C%20whether%20female%20or%20male%2C%20depends%20on%20whether%20the%2023rd%20pair%20of%20chromosomes%20is%20XX%20or%20XY%20respectively.%20Primarily%20sex%20determination%20occurs%20at%20fertilization%20and%20depends%20upon%20the%20type%20of%20sex%20chromosome%20in%20the%20sperm%20that%20fertilizes%20an%20ovum.&amp;f=false">link</a>). </p>
<h2><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>This claim has only been made very recently by Islam apologists for the first time.</li>
<li>Otherwise, not a single Muslim Quran interpreter of the last 14 centuries came to this conclusion from this verse. </li>
<li>There is nothing in this verse which is telling about sex determination.</li>
<li>This verse is simply telling only one thing the process of creation of both sexes starts with the sperm when it is ejected.</li>
</ul>
<p>As compared to this deceptive conjecture of these modern Islam apologists, we have Muhammad himself, who is telling the Islamic concept of sex determination in the following Hadith (tradition). </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210216162555/https://sunnah.com/muslim:315a">Sahih Muslim, Book of Menstruation</a>:<br />... قَالَ ‏"‏ <strong>مَاءُ الرَّجُلِ</strong> أَبْيَضُ <strong>وَمَاءُ الْمَرْأَةِ</strong> أَصْفَرُ فَإِذَا اجْتَمَعَا فَعَلاَ مَنِيُّ الرَّجُلِ مَنِيَّ الْمَرْأَةِ أَذْكَرَا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَإِذَا عَلاَ مَنِيُّ الْمَرْأَةِ مَنِيَّ الرَّجُلِ آنَثَا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ‏"‏ <br />.... The reproductive substance of man is white and that of woman yellow, and when they have sexual intercourse and the male's substance prevails upon the female's substance, it is the male child that is created by Allah's Decree, and when the substance of the female prevails upon the substance contributed by the male, a female child is formed by the Decree of Allah. The Jew said: What you have said is true; verily you are an Apostle. He then returned and went away. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, Muhammad has himself denied the Islam apologists here about the process of sex determination of the fetus. </p>
<p>Muhammad made double Scientific Mistakes in this Hadith:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the reproductive substance of a woman is not yellow. It is a wonder that Muslims still consider Muhammad to be a true messenger of God even after this huge scientific blunder. </li>
<li>Secondly, Muhammad is claiming that the sex of the child is determined if the father's or mother's substance prevails, which is again wrong according to science, while it is the father's chromosome which determines the sex of the fetus. </li>
</ul>
<p>But as we know that Muhammad was doing this Drama of revelation at his own, and making all these stories and claims on his own, therefore, many "human mistakes &amp; contradictions" occurred in these stories. Let us look at the following Hadith. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2645a">Sahih Muslim, Book of Destiny</a>:<br />... Allah's Messenger said: When forty-two nights pass after the semen gets into the womb, Allah sends the angel and gives him shape. Then he creates his sense of hearing, sense of sight, his skin, his flesh, his bones, and then says: <strong>My Lord, would he be male or female? And your Lord decides as He desires </strong>and the angel then puts down that also</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, Muhammad not only contradicted those modern Islam apologists, but in this Hadith, Muhammad contradicted himself too by giving a different reason regarding the determination of the sex of the foetus (i.e. Allah decided it Himself and sex determination has nothing to do with male sperm). </p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>We posted a Hadith above where Muhammad claimed that the reproductive substance of a woman is yellow. This is a fatal scientific mistake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210216162555/https://sunnah.com/muslim:315a">Sahih Muslim, Book of Menstruation</a>:<br />... قَالَ ‏"‏ <strong>مَاءُ الرَّجُلِ</strong> أَبْيَضُ <strong>وَمَاءُ الْمَرْأَةِ</strong> أَصْفَرُ فَإِذَا اجْتَمَعَا فَعَلاَ مَنِيُّ الرَّجُلِ مَنِيَّ الْمَرْأَةِ أَذْكَرَا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَإِذَا عَلاَ مَنِيُّ الْمَرْأَةِ مَنِيَّ الرَّجُلِ آنَثَا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ‏"‏ <br />....  He (the Holy Prophet) said: The reproductive substance of man (Arabic: <strong>مَاءُ الرَّجُلِ)</strong> is white and that of woman (Arabic: <strong>مَاءُ الْمَرْأَةِ</strong>) yellow, and when they have sexual intercourse and the male's substance (chromosomes and genes) prevails upon the female's substance (chromosomes and genes), it is the male child that is created by Allah's Decree, and when the substance of the female prevails upon the substance contributed by the male, a female child is formed by the Decree of Allah. The Jew said: What you have said is true; verily you are an Apostle. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But modern Islam apologists are now trying to use deception, in order to change the meaning of "female substance" by claiming that it does not refer to female discharge during sex (which is not yellow, but white), but it refers to the central part of the female ovum, which is yellow (like egg yolk of hens is yellow):</p>
<p>However, such an interpretation is impossible, since in another Hadith:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, Muhammad claimed that it was quite visible (and the genetic material inside the ovum isn’t)</li>
<li>Secondly, Muhammad claimed that a man's substance is "<strong>thicker</strong>", while of woman's is "<strong>thinner</strong>", which is not possible if we assume the yellow part of the ovum (egg), which is as thick as the sperm (actually it is thicker than male sperm). </li>
<li>In both Hadiths, the word used for man's substance is <strong>مَاءَ الرَّجُلِ </strong>, and the word used for woman's substance is <strong>مَاءَ الْمَرْأَةِ.</strong> Therefore, it is not possible for Islam apologists to cast more doubts about this scientific error of Muhammad. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:311">Sahih Muslim, The Book of Menstruation</a>:<br />أُمَّ سُلَيْمٍ حَدَّثَتْ أَنَّهَا، سَأَلَتْ نَبِيَّ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم عَنِ الْمَرْأَةِ تَرَى فِي مَنَامِهَا مَا يَرَى الرَّجُلُ فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ إِذَا رَأَتْ ذَلِكِ الْمَرْأَةُ فَلْتَغْتَسِلْ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فَقَالَتْ أُمُّ سُلَيْمٍ وَاسْتَحْيَيْتُ مِنْ ذَلِكَ قَالَتْ وَهَلْ يَكُونُ هَذَا فَقَالَ نَبِيُّ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ نَعَمْ فَمِنْ أَيْنَ يَكُونُ الشَّبَهُ إِنَّ<strong> مَاءَ الرَّجُلِ</strong> غَلِيظٌ أَبْيَضُ <strong>وَمَاءَ الْمَرْأَةِ</strong> رَقِيقٌ أَصْفَرُ فَمِنْ أَيِّهِمَا عَلاَ أَوْ سَبَقَ يَكُونُ مِنْهُ الشَّبَهُ ‏"‏ ‏.‏Anas b. Malik reported that Umm Sulaim narrated it that she asked the Messenger of Allah about a woman who sees in a dream what a man sees (sexual dream). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon bi m) said:In case a woman sees that, she must take a bath. Umm Sulaim said: I was bashful on account of that and said: Does it happen? Upon this the Messenger of Allah  said: Yes (it does happen), otherwise how can (a child) resemble her? Man's discharge (Arabic: <strong>مَاءَ الرَّجُلِ</strong>) is <strong>thick </strong>and white and the discharge of woman (Arabic: <strong>مَاءَ الْمَرْأَةِ)</strong> is <strong>thin </strong>and yellow; so the resemblance comes from the one whose genes prevail or dominate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/urn/1255990">Sunnan Ibn Majah, The Book of Purification</a>:<br />It was narrated from Zainab, the daughter of Umm Salamah, that :Her mother Umm Salamah said: "Umm Sulaim came to the Prophet and asked him about a woman who sees in her dream something like a man sees. He said: 'Yes, if she sees water (discharge), let her take a bath.' I said: 'You have embarrassed the women. Do women experience wet dreams?' The Prophet said: 'May your hands be rubbed with dust, how else does her child resemble her?'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even women were able to tell that Muhammad made a wrong claim about their sexual discharge during the dream.</p>
<p>Moreover, do fluids released in a woman's orgasm determine the resemblance of children to parents, or is that genetic information carried by the egg and sperm and determined when they meet?</p>
<p>The answer is simple, as an orgasm does not have anything to do with the egg, which is what carries the genome of the woman. </p>
<p><strong>Actually, discharges of man and woman are even not needed anymore, and one sperm fertilizes one egg mechanically through syringe, but still babies resemble to the mother and father. </strong> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Islamic preachers assert that the following verse of the Quran confirms that the miracle of moon splitting indeed happened. One of them wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Quran confirms that the moon splitting incident indeed happened.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/54/1/">Quran 54:1</a>  ٱقۡتَرَبَتِ ٱلسَّاعَةُ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>وَٱنشَقَّ </strong></span>ٱلۡقَمَرُ</p>
<p>The Hour (of Judgment) is nigh, and the moon <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>is cleft asunder</strong></span> (Translation by Yusuf Ali)</p>
<p>The grammar that is used for <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>وَٱنشَقَّ</strong></span> (cleft asunder) is "<strong>perfect verb فعل ماض</strong>"  (See the <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=54&amp;verse=1">CorpusQuran Website</a> for grammar) which means this incident has already happened in the past. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And we respond to this claim as under:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Firstly: The verse talks about the splitting of the moon in the FUTURE</strong></span></p>
<p>The correct understanding of this verse is:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This verse does not tell about any '<strong>past</strong>' incident where the moon has already been split. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But this verse is figuratively talking about the '<strong>FUTURE</strong>', where the Hour <strong>WILL </strong>come.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And when the hour will come, only at that time the moon will also split. </li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the moon will not split into TWO EQUAL parts (as it allegedly happened according to Ahadith), but it will split into <strong>MANY </strong>parts (i.e. in the sense of total destruction). </li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muslim translator  <a class="mw-redirect" title="M. A. S. Abdel Haleem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._S._Abdel_Haleem">M. A. S. Abdel Haleem</a>  wrote in the footnote of this verse (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_of_the_Moon">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>The Arabic uses the past tense, as if that Day were already here, to help the reader/listener imagine how it will be</strong>. Some traditional commentators hold the view that this describes an actual event at the time of the Prophet, <strong>but it clearly refers to the end of the world</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There are traditional Muslim Scholars, who also mentioned the same.Al-Qurtabi recorded it in his commentary of the Quran (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;tSoraNo=54&amp;tAyahNo=1&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">وقال قوم: لم يقع ٱنشقاق القمر بعدُ وهو منتظر أي ٱقترب قيام الساعة وٱنشقاق القمر وأن الساعة إذا قامت ٱنشقت السماء بما فيها من القمر وغيره. وكذا قال القشيري. وذكر الماورديّ: <strong>أن هذا قول الجمهور</strong>، وقال: لأنه إذا ٱنشق ما بقي أحد إلا رآه لأنه آية والناس في الآيات سواء. وقال الحسن: ٱقتربت الساعة فإذا جاءت ٱنشق القمر بعد النفخة الثانية.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Some people have said that the splitting of the moon has not yet occurred and is still awaited. They interpret this as meaning that the approach of the Day of Judgment and the splitting of the moon are imminent, and that when the Hour (the Day of Judgment) arrives, the sky will split apart, including the moon and everything else in it. Al-Qushayri also mentioned this view. <strong>Al-Mawardi noted that this is the opinion of the majority</strong>, explaining that if the moon were to split, everyone would see it because it is a sign, and all people are equal when it comes to witnessing signs. Al-Hasan said that the Hour has drawn near, and when it comes, the moon will split after the second trumpet blast.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Al-Raghib al-Isfahani, Al-Mawardi and Al-Zamakhshari in their commentaries, in addition to mentioning the miracle, also note that the second half of verse 54:1 can be read as "and the moon will be cleaved", referring to one of the signs of the Islamic end of times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For example, look at this verse, where the same grammar of "<strong>perfect verb فعل ماض</strong>"  is used (please see the same <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=55&amp;verse=37">CorpusQuran Website</a> for grammar):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/55/37/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55:37</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">فَإِذَا ٱنشَقَّتِ ٱلسَّمَآءُ</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When the sky is rent asunder (Translation by Yusuf Ali)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We can see that the sky has not been asunder in the past, but the Quran is telling about a future event in this verse. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Secondly: The moon will not split into Two Equal parts, but into MANY parts</strong></span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islamic literature claims that Muhammad split the moon into two equal parts. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, the word وَٱنشَقَّ does not mean here "splitting into <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">TWO Equal Parts</strong>", but it is used in the meaning of "<strong>Total Destruction</strong>"  i.e. to "<strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">split asunder/cleft asunder into MANY Parts</strong>".</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For example:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://quranx.com/55.37" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">55:37</a>:<br>فَإِذَا ٱنشَقَّتِ ٱلسَّمَآءُ<br>And when the heaven splitteth asunder</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This does not mean that heaven will split asunder into TWO Equal Parts, but it means total destruction. Similarly:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://quranx.com/50.44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50:44</a>:<br>یَوۡمَ تَشَقَّقُ الۡاَرۡضُ<br>On the day when the earth splitteth asunder from them</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Again, this does not mean that the Earth will split into Two Equal Parts, but it means total destruction.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"></p>
<h3>Islamic Apologists: The 2nd verse of Surah 54 makes clear that indeed the incident of the splitting of the moon happened</h3>
<p>The first 2 verses of Surah 54 are as under:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="stcl2"><a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/54/1/default.htm">54:1</a>  The Hour has come near, and the moon has split</div>
<div class="stcl2"><a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/54/2/default.htm">54:2</a>  <span>Yet, whenever they see a sign, they turn away, saying, “Same old magic!”</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Islamic apologists claim that the 2nd verse is proof that indeed the 1st verse is talking about the past incident of the splitting of the moon. </p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>This verse does not say that the pagans said "<strong>particularly</strong>" about the miracle of the splitting of moon to be a magic. No, but this is a "<strong>common</strong>" statement by disbelievers whenever a miracle is shown to them, they claim it to be a magic.</p>
<p>It says that whenever the disbelievers see a sign, they pass it off as magic. It is very consistent with the future tense interpretation of the moon split. It's a warning to the kuffar that they should accept whenever a prophet comes to them before judgement day seals their fate.</p>
<ul>
<li>The second verse in Arabic is clearly in the present (continuous) tense.</li>
<li>To report an event such as a miracle occurring in the past that includes onlookers, the onlookers’ actions should also be in the past. But here it is in the present (continuous) tense.</li>
<li>It clearly refers to the <strong>continuous</strong> <strong>GENERAL BEHAVIOUR</strong> of non-believers denying Allah’s warnings and signs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the 2nd verse was indeed for the particular past incident of the splitting of moon, then it should have also been in the past tense, and it should have looked like this:</p>

<p>These are undoubtedly fabricated traditions and falsehoods propagated by Muslim transmitters of Ahadith.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Quran itself documents the persistent demand of the Pagans/Jews, who repeatedly asked Muhammad/Allah to provide any sign or miracle as evidence of Muhammad's prophethood. However, Muhammad/Allah failed to produce a single sign or miracle. Instead of demonstrating any miraculous signs, the Quran offered various EXCUSES for Muhammad's inability to do so. These Quranic Excuses included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muhammad's inability to perform miracles while he is only a human.</li>
<li>Allah's decision not to send miracles to Muhammad at this time, as previous nations had rejected the miracles of earlier prophets.</li>
<li>Allah does not show any miracle to the pagans as He has already <strong>DECIDED </strong>that the pagans would not get guidance. </li>
<li>Muhammad's refusal to perform miracles for the Jews due to the sins of their forefathers.</li>
<li>The absence of the predicted miracle of the sky falling on the Meccans, is attributed to Muhammad's presence among them and Allah didn't want Muhammad to be hurt due to any divine punishment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dear Reader, please contemplate these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>people of Mecca</strong></span> indeed saw the splitting of the moon, why then they were demanding Muhammad to bring a miracle as proof of his prophethood?</li>
<li>And why didn't Allah/Muhammad not simply refer to the incident of the splitting of the moon as proof of Muhammad's prophethood?"</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the Quran consistently offered numerous explanations without ever using the alleged incident of the moon splitting to address the pagans' challenge to provide a miracle. Not only the Quran, but the entire Hadith literature is also devoid of any instance where Muhammad used this alleged miracle of splitting the moon in response to the pagans' demand for a miracle.</p>
<p>Let us see the details about these Quranic Excuses here to understand it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 1st Quranic Excuse: Muhammad cannot show a Miracle while he is only a human</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident occurred in Mecca. Muhammad used to threaten the Meccans, warning them to believe in his prophethood or face the consequences, claiming that his Allah would make the sky fall upon them in fragments. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>: And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "...  <strong>Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">AS YOU HAVE (previously) CLAIMED</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Actually, the pagan Meccans not only accepted this challenge by Muhammad but also extended it and asked Muhammad to show other miracles too and they would believe in his prophethood. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, Muhammad/Allah failed to deliver on this promise.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, Muhammad was forced to come up with an <strong>EXCUSE</strong> for his failure to fulfil his promise and show any miracle. And he made the following excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring. Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>as you have (previously) claimed</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read." <strong> Say: "Glory to my Lord. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(I cannot do it while)</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">I am only man and a messenger</span></em></span></strong></span>." </p>
<p><span>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/67.25?context=3">67:25-26</a>: </span></p>
<p><span>They ask, <strong>when will this promise be fulfilled</strong>, if you are truthful? Say, God alone has knowledge of that; and <strong>I am only a warner</strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer of the Quran (i.e., Muhammad himself) attempted to justify his failure to perform miracles by claiming that he was merely a messenger and could not perform miracles.</p>
<p>However, the pagan Meccans had issued this challenge not only to Muhammad <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but also to Muhammad's god <span style="color: #2800ff;">(i.e., Allah was already automatically included in this challenge)</span></strong></span>. They believed that if Allah truly existed, He should have demonstrated a miracle to them.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was Muhammad/Allah who promised that the sky would fall upon them if they didn't believe in Muhammad's prophethood. Yet, both Muhammad and his Allah failed to fulfill their promise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Muhammad's lack of miracles was due to his role as a mere messenger, why did previous prophets demonstrate miracles to validate their prophethood? For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, Cured the blind and the leper and gave life to the dead by God’s permission (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.110">5:110</a> and <a href="https://quranx.com/3.49">3:49</a>).</li>
<li>Moses received nine miracles, including his staff transforming into a dragon, his hand becoming radiant, the plague of locusts/lice, the swarm of frogs, and the parting of the sea for the Children of Israel (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.101">17:101</a>).</li>
<li>Solomon comprehended the language of animals and birds and controlled jinn and winds (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.16?context=2">27:16-17</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/34.12?context=2">34:12-13</a>),</li>
<li>while Joseph interpreted dreams and predicted future events (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.46?context=2">12:46-47</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/40.51?context=2">40:51-52</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the Meccans were correct in their demand. Even the Quran mentioned their argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/21.5">21:5</a>: So let him bring us a sign just <strong>as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles].</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, if the earlier prophets were able to demonstrate miracles despite being humans, why then Muhammad could not?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And then the Quran claims that Allah does not change his PRACTICE (i.e. Sunnah):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.77">17:77</a>:</strong> This has been Our Way with the Messengers whom We sent before you. You will find <strong>no change</strong> in our <strong>Practice</strong> (i.e. the Sunnah of Allah).</p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>:</strong> [This is] the established practice of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the Practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>:</strong> <strong>But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quran presents a contradiction regarding the expectation of miracles from prophets. In one instance, it suggests that prophets are not required to display miracles as evidence of their prophethood, yet in another, it describes earlier prophets performing miracles to prove their legitimacy. This raises a question: Why did earlier prophets show miracles to disbelievers, but Muhammad and his Allah refused to do so?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that the Quran recounts fictional tales of earlier prophets' miracles, which cannot be verified since they took place in the distant past. Conversely, when it came to Muhammad and his Allah, they were expected to perform miracles in real-time, right before the very eyes of the Kuffar Meccans who challenged them. However, they failed to deliver on these expectations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The 2nd Quranic Excuse: Allah would not send a miracle to Muhammad this time while nations of earlier prophets denied the miracles of earlier prophets</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident also happened in Mecca.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58-59</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَسْطُورًا</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِلَّآ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ</span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And We <span style="color: #e03e2d; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REFRAIN </strong></span>from sending the signs (now in front of Kuffar Meccans), <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only because the men of former generations treated them as false</strong></span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meccans repeatedly asked Muhammad for a miracle, but he always offered new excuses for not delivering one. Earlier Muhammad claimed he could not perform any miracle while he was only a human being. But that excuse was shaky as the challenge was not limited to Muhammad only, but his god (i.e. Allah) was also automatically included in that challenge. </p>
<p>Thus, Muhammad was forced to change his excuse. This time, he came up with a new excuse that Allah had ceased sending new miracles/signs since earlier people rejected them.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, Allah's practice (i.e. Sunnah of Allah ) supposedly changed when earlier people denied the signs. However, this contradicts the Quranic CLAIM that Allah's Sunnah never changes.</p>
<p>As they say, where there's a contradiction, there's a lie.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's worth noting that there's also a flaw in Verse 58:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad recounted various tales in the Quran about ancient prophets like Thamud, 'Aad and Saleh etc., describing how their communities were destroyed by Allah. Muhammad presumed that nobody could fact-check his accounts by journeying into the past. However, he made a critical error.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that, according to the Quran, Jesus also performed miracles in front of the Jews and Romans. He spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, cured the blind and the leper, and even brought the dead back to life, all by God's permission (Quran 5:110 and 3:49). Yet, neither the Jews nor the Romans believed in him. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Despite this, neither the Jews nor the Romans of Jesus's era were destroyed </strong></span>(<span style="color: #0000ff;">which again goes against the Quranic Promise of Destruction</span>).</p>
<p>The incident of Jesus took place in the recent past, making it feasible to verify its authenticity through historical records. Thus, this claim in the Quran has been exposed as a lie.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The 3rd Excuse: Muhammad shouldn't ask Allah for a Miracle while Allah had misguided the Pagans</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the previous two excuses naturally failed to satisfy people regarding Muhammad's/Allah's inability to show any miracle. They continued to ask Muhammad to bring a miracle as proof of his prophethood. To deflect their demand, Muhammad introduced another excuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>He (Muhammad) cannot ask Allah for any miracle because Allah does not want the pagans to be guided.</li>
<li>And if he (Muhammad) persists in asking Allah for a miracle, then Allah will punish him, and he (Muhammad) will be among the ignorant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/6/35/default.htm">6:35</a>:</p>
<p>وَإِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكَ إِعْرَاضُهُمْ فَإِنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتَ أَن تَبْتَغِىَ نَفَقًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَوْ سُلَّمًا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَأْتِيَهُم <strong>بِـَٔايَةٍ</strong> ۚ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَمَعَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ ۚ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ</p>
<p>If you (O Muhammad) find rejection by the unbelievers so unbearable, then seek a tunnel into the ground or a ladder into the sky in order to bring them a <strong>SIGN</strong>, but [remember that], <strong>had God willed it</strong>, <strong>He would have guided all of them. Do not be among the ignorant (by asking a SIGN from Allah)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more, this verse serves as evidence that no miracle was shown to the Meccan disbelievers by Muhammad/Allah. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2>The 4th Quranic Excuse: Muhammad will not show the miracle to the Jews while their forefathers sinned</h2>
<p>This incident happened just after Muhammad's migration to Medina when he had to prove his prophethood to the Jews of Medina. </p>
<p>The Bible contains several passages that highlight the phenomenon of divine acceptance of a person's sacrificial offering through the appearance of a mysterious fire that consumes the offering. These instances can be found in verses such as Judges 6:20-21, 13:19-20, and 2 Chronicles 7:1-2.</p>
<p>Actually, Muhammad had already made a mistake, and he had also previously confirmed this method of the miracle of fire in the Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.27">5:27</a>, in the story of Adam and his sons, where a fire appeared and consumed the offering of one son who sacrificed a sheep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/5.27"> 5:27</a>:</p>
<p>Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one, but not from the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tafsir Tabari, under verse 5:27 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=3&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was narrated from as-Suddi, in his narration from Abu Maalik and from Abu Saalih from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Murrah from Ibn Mas‘ood, and from some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ... Habeel (Abel) offered a fat lamb as his offering, while Qabeel (Cain) presented a sheaf of corn but secretly took out and consumed a large portion of the corn. Subsequently, fire descended from the heavens and consumed Habeel's offering, while Qabeel's offering remained untouched and unaccepted. In response, Qabeel became enraged and threatened to kill Habeel, vowing that he would not allow him to marry his sister.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220428104808/https://dorar.net/h/808e9bbf2bff4252bd3830e50578ec2d"> Sahih (Albani)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, when Muhammad asserted his prophethood, the Jews asked him to provide proof through the manifestation of a miracle, specifically the fire consuming his offering.</p>
<p>Muhammad found himself unable to dismiss this demand outright, as he already acknowledged it in the story of Adam in the Quran.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad resorted to a different approach, offering a new excuse. He accepted the validity of the miracle involving the fire accepting the offering, but he refused to showcase this miracle. He justified his inability to show this miracle by accusing the Jews of Medina that their forefathers sinned by killing previous prophets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/3.183?context=3"> 3:183</a>:</p>
<p>They (the Jews) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in any messenger <strong>unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire</strong> (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: <strong>why then did ye slay them</strong>, if ye speak the truth?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this excuse by the writer of the Quran does not hold up under scrutiny for several reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is unjust to punish individuals for the sins of their ancestors. In this case, the writer of the Quran is essentially claiming to hold the Jews of his time accountable for the actions of their forefathers. This contradicts the concept of divine justice, which does not attribute guilt based on lineage.</p>
<p>Didn't the quran claim that no one is accountable for the action of others?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/6.164">6:164</a>:</p>
<p>Say, "Is it other than Allāh I should desire as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? <strong>And every soul earns not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the Jews of Muhammad's era maintained a strong belief in their own holy scriptures, which also indicated that the proof of prophethood involved successfully passing the miracle test. It is understandable that they would request the same evidence from Muhammad and, upon his failure to provide it, reject his claims. This rejection cannot be seen as their fault, as they were simply following the principles outlined in their own religious texts.</p>
<p>Ironically, when the Jewish holy books seemingly predicted the arrival of Muhammad (<a href="https://www.judaism-islam.com/muhammad-in-the-torah-bible/">according to Muslim claims</a>), Muhammad expected the Jews to adhere to their own scriptures. However, when those same holy books instructed them to seek the miracle of fire as a validation of prophethood, Muhammad wanted them to abandon that requirement. This double standard raises questions about consistency and fairness.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the writer of the Quran contradicts his own claims within the text. The Quran repeatedly asserts that the practices of Allah remain unchanging. Yet, in this instance, Muhammad is deviating from that principle by rejecting the miracle of fire as a valid proof of prophethood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>: [This is] the established way of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>: <strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Muhammad was unable to perform the miracle of fire in front of the Jews, a sudden shift occurred in the ways of Allah to accommodate his inability to demonstrate miracles.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it is worth noting that compared to the ancestors of the Jews, the ancestors of the <strong>pagan Meccans (Mushrikeen)</strong> did not have a history of killing prophets. However, Muhammad didn't show any miracle to them too by making other excuses. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad got so much exposure in this incident, that despite all his struggles to make the Jews of Medina happy in the beginning (by adopting many Biblical laws in Islamic Sharia), not even 10 Jews of Medina believed in him and converted to Islam;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3941">Sahih Bukhari, 3941</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Prophet said: <span class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">"Had only ten Jews believe me, all the Jews would definitely have believed me."</strong></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 5th Quranic Excuse: The Miracle of the Sky Falling on the Meccans Did Not Occur due to Muhammad's Presence Among Them</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident happened later in Medina after Muhammad had also failed to show the miracle of fire to the Jews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/8.32?context=2">8:32</a>: </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And when they [Meccans] said, "O Allah, if this should be the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment."<strong> But Allah did not punish them while you, [O Muhammad], was among them</strong>, and Allah would not punish them while they sought forgiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse was revealed in Medina after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Badr">Battle of Badr</a> (in the 2nd Hijri Year), in which Muhammad got victory against the Meccan pagans. </p>
<p>Is it not strange and ridiculous that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AFTER MANY MANY YEARS</strong></span>, Allah remembered to tell the <strong>reason </strong>why He didn't let the sky fall on Meccan pagans? During the 13 years of the Meccan life of Muhammad, the pagans were constantly demanding and challenging Muhammad/Allah to fulfil their promise, but Allah uttered not a single word. </p>
<p>Two more pertinent questions arise from this narrative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, why did Allah not choose to punish the Meccans with the miracle of the falling sky during Muhammad's absence or just after his migration to Medina? Due to no divine punishment, the Meccan pagans succeeded in waging wars against Muhammad, even killing many Muslims and even breaking the teeth of Muhammad in the Battle of Uhud. But despite breaking the teeth of Muhammad, and despite Muhammad's absence among them, still no sky fell on them. </li>
<li>Secondly, the Meccans did not solely request the miracle of punishment; rather, they sought any miraculous manifestation (even without any punishment), similar to those experienced by the previous prophets, that could substantiate Muhammad's claim to prophethood. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Please see the following verse again where they are also asking Muhammad for any miracle (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>even without punishment</strong></span>), and they were ready to believe in his prophethood. </span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(1)</strong></span> you break open for us from the ground a spring. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(2)</strong></span> Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the SKY FALL UPON US IN FRAGMENTS AS YOU HAVE CLAIMED <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(3)</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(4)</strong></span> Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(5)</strong></span> or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read."  Say: "Glory to my Lord. (I cannot do it while) I am only man and a messenger." </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, Muhammad along with his Allah failed to show even any simple miracle without any punishment, as it happened in the cases of previous prophets. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_of_the_Moon#NASA_photograph">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_of_the_Moon#NASA_photograph</a></p>
<p><span>After NASA made an Apollo mission photograph of Rima Ariadaeus available online, it began circulating in the Muslim online community, with "the moon's crack line" being interpreted as evidence that the Moon had once split. NASA clarified that the image shows a lunar rille similar to Earth's geological faults, stretching about 300 km. Astronomer Paul Groot from Radboud University explained that the "split" seen in the photo does not encircle the entire lunar surface, and it possibly relates to the impact that formed the Tycho crater nearby the feature. Additionally, NASA scientist Brad Bailey stated, "No current scientific evidence reports that the Moon was split into two (or more) parts and then reassembled at any point in the past."</span></p>

<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islamic Apologist: God shows miracles by His Will and on His time per His Wisdom</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">An Islamic apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Concluding that "Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) not showing a miracle on demand must mean he had an inability to show miracles" by itself is an "argument from silence" or "negative proof fallacy." It fails to consider that there may be other reasons for those miracles not being shown at those times, the most ultimate being that God shows miracles by His Will and on His time per His Wisdom, not just by the mere demands of humans. Humans don't rush God. But God later showed miracles when the time was right, indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>If Allah had himself presented this excuse in the Quran (i.e. Allah will show the miracle to pagans at the time of his choice), then there would have been absolutely no problem. But not showing the miracle <strong>at all</strong> is the problem.</p>
<p>And then coming up with different lame excuses for his complete failure to show miracles is again a problem.</p>
<p>Firstly, Muhammad/Allah started the game of threatening about miraculously falling the sky on the Meccans if they didn't believe in the prophethood of Muhammad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<p>And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, ... you make the SKY FALL UPON US IN FRAGMENTS <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>AS YOU HAVE (previously) CLAIMED</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only did the Meccans accept this challenge by Muhammad/Allah, but they also added to it and asked Muhammad to perform even other small miracles. However, Muhammad/Allah failed to fulfil their promise of the sky falling on them. This means Muhammad/Allah didn't show the miracle <strong>at all</strong>. This is not equal to the claim of the Islamic apologist (i.e. Allah showing a miracle at a time of his own choice). </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, the Quran presented the excuse that A<span style="font-size: 1rem;">llah stopped sending the signs/miracles to the Kuffar of the era of Muhammad while earlier kuffar Nations didn't take a lesson from signs/miracles (Quran 17:58-59). This excuse is again not equal to the claim of the Islamic apologist (i.e. Allah showing a miracle at a time of his own choice).</span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h3>Islamic Apologist: Not all Ahadith about miracles of the Prophet can be denied</h3>
<p>An Islamic apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dismissing Hadith entirely in order to formulate your thesis is the set up of a strawman because you're not working within the full framework of religious texts that are followed by the religious community. Thus, your argument can only validly work against Hadith Rejectors/Quranists, not against mainstream Islam. Per mainstream Islam, there are more than enough Hadith that demonstrate that Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) did miracles, some of which are indeed touched upon in the Qur'an [e.g., the moon splitting, night journey and ascension].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Only Muslims regard the science of hadith as reliable. Therefore, using it as evidence in this discussion is entirely futile unless you can prove the reliability of the science of hadith.</p>
<p>There are numerous so-called Sahih (authentic) and Ahadith that claim the occurrence of the incident of the splitting of the moon, such as those found in:</p>
<ul>

<li>... and many more (Muslims claim these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_terminology#:~:text=A%20hadith%20is%20said%20to,leading%20back%20to%20its%20source.">Mutawatir </a>Ahadith regarding this issue)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, all of them are contradicted by the Quranic verses themselves, which assert that Allah had ceased sending signs/miracles to the disbelievers of Muhammad's era, as earlier disbelieving nations failed to heed signs/miracles (Quran 17:58-59).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58-59</a>:</p>
<p>وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَسْطُورًا وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِلَّآ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">And We <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REFRAIN </strong></span>from sending the <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>signs </strong></span>(now in front of Kuffar Meccans), <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only because the men of former generations treated them as false</strong></span></span>. (Translated by Yusuf Ali)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, Muhammad himself never presented this so-called splitting of the moon as a miracle of his prophethood, despite constant demands from the Meccans to demonstrate any miracle.</p>
<p>This serves as sufficient evidence that no such incident of moon splitting by Muhammad ever occurred, and all those numerous so-called Sahih (and Mutawatir) Ahadith regarding that incident are nothing more than fabrications by Muslims.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ahadith can never be relied upon, as Muslim transmitters of hadith were engaging in the fabrication of Ahadith.</p>
<p>If these numerous Sahih (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_terminology#:~:text=A%20hadith%20is%20said%20to,leading%20back%20to%20its%20source.">Mutawatir</a>) Ahadith are proven to be fabrications in the case of the splitting of the moon, then what assurance is there that Ahadith concerning other miracles are not fabrications as well?</p>

<p>The segment of interest is from 23:20 onwards. There is no doubt that a manuscript containing the story of the Indian king is a genuine manuscript, as confirmed by the British Library. What we are interested in is whether the contents of the story are true, rather than the genuineness of the manuscript. Sheikh Uthman explains that he reached out to the National Digital Library of India to ask them about additional documentation of the story. The response email states that an English translation of the Qissat exists, authored by Dr Yohanan Friedman, in the Israel Oriental Studies Journal.</p>
<ul>

  " href="https://www.academia.edu/17121060/Qissat_Shakarwati_Farmad_a_tradition_concerning_the_introduction_of_Islam_to_Malabar" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here it is important to note that this work by Dr Friedman is actually available for free online</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For some strange reason, Sheikh Uthman decides not to examine this translation further, because if he had, the rest of his video would have been rendered unnecessary. Dr Friedman's work is not just a translation, but a scholarly discussion of the source material and whether any authenticity can be ascribed to it. So let's take a look at the paper that I linked above. Right in the beginning, Dr Friedman laments how the sources dealing with the subject are "full of inconsistencies and contradictions" that historians are unable to form any agreement. Regarding the story of the Indian king, he explains that the dating of this story is a matter of controversy:</p>
<p><img src="https://sachaai.com/images/moon_split_friedmann1.png" loading="lazy" width="922" height="777" alt="moon splitting Indian King - Friedmann 1" data-path="local-images:/moon_split_friedmann1.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="https://sachaai.com/images/moon_split_friedmann2.png" loading="lazy" width="920" height="567" alt="moon splitting Indian King - Friedmann 2" data-path="local-images:/moon_split_friedmann2.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>As we can see, Dr Friedman lists three widely different opinions of the story's dating, none of them overlapping with the prophethood years of Muhammad. This is already an issue for Sheikh Uthman, which is probably why he didn't share any of this with his Youtube audience.</p>
<p>It must be pointed out that historians are not rejecting this story because of their commitment to naturalism; they are rejecting it because the authorship and the dates of the manuscripts are completely unknown. The original stories have anonymous authors, so even if a modern historian believed in a God who split the moon, there would still be no reason for him to accept this Indian story due to its unknown origins.</p>
<p>The Sheikh continues reading the email. The email states that the story of the Indian king embracing Islam is<span> </span><em>"well documented in many manuscripts that are housed in the National Digital Library of India</em>." Here we must pause and understand the wording used. The email states that the story is "<em>well documented</em>", not "<em>well corroborated</em>". This is important to note because to document a story means you are simply recording the story after hearing it from another source. It is possible for a story to be recorded a hundred times by different people and it would still have no bearing on the story's authenticity, because the story is simply being passed on from one person to the next as is.</p>
<p>A story is corroborated if we have more than one source from the time of the event itself. As we will divulge from this post, no such corroboration for this story exists. In fact, no one even knows who wrote the original story, and no one knows when it was written. No one even knows anything about this very king who the story is about. So corroboration is an impossibility.</p>
<p>The email continues by naming two more works that mention the story. The first being Tarikh Zuhur Al Islam Fil Malibar, which is labelled as "an early manuscript on the genesis of Islam in Kerala". There is a reason the librarian simply calls it "an early manuscript" instead of giving more details — and that is because the contents of this manuscript have never been confirmed to be authentic, and no one even knows the date it was written in.</p>
<p>The second work mentioned in the email is Tuhfat al-Mujahidin by Sheikh Zayn ud-Din. Once again, Shaykh Uthman doesn't care to examine the contents of the material he is being recommended. If he actually cared to read the Tuhfat al-Mujahidin,<span> </span><a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a
  
  
  
  
  hover:underline
  " href="https://archive.org/details/Tuhfat-al-MujahidinAnHistoricalWorkInTheArabicLanguage/mode/2up" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">which can be done from here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...then he would have known that Zayn ud-Din does not support the story at all. Instead, Zayn ud-Din claims that the Indian king converted to Islam in the 9th century, 200 years after the actual moon split story is said to have taken place. He rejects the original story as told in the Qissat Shakarwati Farmad, and is quoted as saying, "<strong>there is but little truth in this</strong>".</p>

<p>Moving on, the email then names four more personalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hermann Gundert</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duarte Barbosa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>João de Barros</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diogo do Couto</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All four of these individuals lived after the 14th century, and they were simply recording the stories as local legends of the Indian people. Duarte Barbosa is even hostile to it, calling Muhammad the "abominable Mafamede". Yet again, if Shaykh Uthman had simply read the source material being recommended, he would have understood that these historians were simply documenting these stories for educational purposes. Barbosa starts his narration with the words "they say", implying that this is the story as it is believed by the locals.</p>

<p>We can now move on to modern scholarship around this story. It is strange that the National Library of India cited Dr Friedman's translation to Sheikh Uthman, which is from 1975. Dr Friedman's translation is only a summary of the story, rather than a full translation of the complete text. There is in fact a more recent work from 2017, authored by Scott Kugle and Roxani Elani Margariti, in<span> </span><a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a

			<title>Zamzam Water:  Miracles or Deceptions?</title>
			<link>https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/zamzam-water-miracles-or-deceptions</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/zamzam-water-miracles-or-deceptions</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Islamic preachers claim many miracles about Zamzam water. Let us see if they are real miracles or only deceptions by Islamic preachers. </p>
<p>First of all, Zakir Naik claims (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zakirnaikofficial/photos/a.150461375036187/528099710605683/?__tn__=%2CO*F">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">... So they pumped 690 Millions liters of Zam Zam in 24 hours, but it was re-supplied in 11 minutes only. There are 2 miracles here, the first that Zam Zam was re-filled immediately, &amp; the second is that Allah Holds the extra-ordinarily powerful Aquifer for not throwing extra Zam Zam out of the well, otherwise the world will SINK.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The water in Zamzam’s well in Mecca is not depleted because it is an aquifer, and its reservoir is connected to renewable groundwater (which ultimately replenishes from rainwater in the valley and the surrounding hills).</p>
<p>The city of Mecca is located in a valley, which is surrounded by hills. And Masjid-ul-Haram (and the well of Zamzam) is the LOWEST point in this valley. The well of Zamzam is about 40 to 50 feet deep from the level of water in the surrounding hills. This causes the water of the whole valley and the surrounding hilly areas to move towards the Zamzam reservoir (<a href="https://ur.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%B2%D9%85">link)</a>. </p>
<p>There are hundreds of such aquifers present in the world, with a huge amount of water. Some of them have so much water that it comes out as streams and springs. Although Zamzam also has a lot of water, it cannot be compared in size and volume to many of those other aquifers, while no water streams or springs flow from it, but it is only a "Well". And Saudi Government has to put in huge pumps in order to take water out of it. And Saudi government also has to regulate its consumption. </p>
<p>Thus, although Zamzam is ONLY a well (and does not even have enough water for springs and streams), still Zakir Naik claims that Allah has stopped Zamzam to overflow, otherwise it will sink the entire world while it has an indefinite amount of water. And the most unfortunate thing is that Muslim preachers like Zakir Naik are still able to deceive millions of innocent people, by fooling them with such lies. </p>
<p>Please think about it, if Zamzam really had an indefinite amount of water, then the whole of Mecca would be full of greenery, and Saudi Government would have used it for establishing green farmlands and cultivation around Mecca. </p>
<h2>Muhammad's fantasy stories about the sweet water of the Nile and the Euphrates </h2>
<p>Muslim preachers, like Zakir Naik, are only making such stories on their own while they know that their followers are ignorant, and will not catch their false stories. </p>
<p>And the same was the case with Muhammad too. Please read the following Ahadith. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3207">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3207</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said: .... (On the night of ascension, where he went to heavens) Then I was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, <em><strong>and four rivers originated at its root</strong></em>, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, 'The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the <em><strong>Nile and the Euphrates</strong></em>.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2839">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2839:</a></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: <em><strong>Saihan, Jaihan</strong></em>, <em><strong>Euphrates and Nile</strong></em> are all among the rivers of Paradise.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The people of that era didn't know about the sources of water in rivers. Thus, Muhammad made up fantasy stories that sweet water in these two rivers comes directly from the heavens. And unfortunately, billions of Muslims become fools and believe in such fantasy stories of Muhammad, instead of challenging him. </p>
<p>Now, these Ahadith became a headache for Islamic apologists, as they fit in none of the cosmological models. They are unable to answer how water, which is coming out of the root of a Tin the paradise, lands on the earth.</p>
<p>But this issue was also solved when we find the same story in the bible too (nevertheless, a little different concept).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:10-2:14">Genesis 2:10-14</a>: <span id="en-NIV-41" class="text Gen-2-10">A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into <em><strong>four</strong></em> headwaters.</span><span id="en-NIV-42" class="text Gen-2-11"><sup class="versenum"> </sup>The name of the first is the <strong>Pishon </strong>۔۔۔</span><span id="en-NIV-44" class="text Gen-2-13">The name of the second river is the <em><strong>Gihon</strong></em>; it winds through the entire land of Cush. </span><span id="en-NIV-45" class="text Gen-2-14">The name of the third river is the <strong>Tigris</strong>; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the <strong>Euphrates</strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference between the story of the Bible, and the story of Muhammad is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The '<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden"><em><strong>Garden of Eden</strong></em></a>' (The paradise, where God kept Adam and Eve and the forbidden tree) <em><strong>was present <span style="color: #ff0000;">on the earth</span></strong></em> in the story of the bible. Thus, it was not a problem when the bible claimed that the water of Tigris and Ecomesates come from the 'Garden of Eden'.</li>
<li>But Muhammad made a mistake while copying the story of the bible, and he claimed that Adam and Eve and the forbidden tree <em><strong>were NOT present on the earth, but in paradise <span style="color: #ff0000;">in the heavens</span></strong></em>. Thus, it became a problem to explain how the water from the root of a tree in heaven, lands in the rivers on the earth. </li>
</ul>
<p>Muhammad was copying the stories of the bible, but he was still very much illiterate and not a scholar. Thus, he made a lot of <em><strong>human mistakes</strong></em> while copying those older stories. </p>

<h2>Muslim Preachers: Zamzam was discovered 2600 years before Muhammad by Hajar and Ismael</h2>
<p>This story is also false. </p>
<p>Actually, the whole story of Ibrahim and Hajar and Ismael coming to Mecca is false and only an invention of Muhammad himself. Muhammad invented this story, in order to get importance among Jews and Christians for being a descendant of Ibrahim. </p>
<p>The Quraysh (and all other Arabs) had no idea that they were from the progeny of Ismael/Ibrahim, and Kaba has anything to do with Ibrahim, or Zamzam was discovered by Hajar, etc. Muhammad was the first one who invented all those stories and told them to Quraysh/Arabs. </p>
<p>You can read all these facts on this website: <a href="https://historyofmecca.com/">https://historyofmecca.com/</a></p>
<p>It is a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Very, Very</strong><strong> Important </strong></span>issue, and those who want to search for the truth, have to read all the facts on the above-mentioned website. It exposes completely all these false stories by Muhammad. <span style="color: #0f00ff;"><strong>Please,</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #0f00ff;">don't miss reading articles on this website (unfortunately, many of us are totally unaware of these important facts)</span></strong>. </p>
<p>The Quraysh knew very well that the well of Zamzam was discovered only 40 years before the birth of Muhammad, by his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib. Even Islamic traditions also recorded it. Nevertheless, Muslim preachers came up with another fantasy story that Zamzam was actually discovered by Hajar, but then one tribe closed it and made it hidden from others. And it stayed hidden for centuries (or thousands of years) till Abdul Mutalib again discovered it. </p>
<p>But how is it possible?</p>
<p>According to stories by Muhammad, initially, all Arabs were monotheists, and they were visiting Kaba for Hajj every year, and they were drinking water from Zamzam for centuries. How can then a tribe close and hide it, when thousands of Arabs knew exactly where it was situated (near Kaba) and drank water from it every year?</p>
<p>Naturally, Islamic preachers have no answer to this. </p>
<h2>Zamzam was full of SNAKES till Muhammad ordered to kill them</h2>
<p>Today, Muslim preachers deceive people by telling them miracles of Zamzam water like it has supernatural healing effects and (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200801183358/https://www.arabnews.com/node/1712901/saudi-arabia">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The well’s ever-clean water has no moss, insects, fungus, or any other impurities. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the truth is, there are poisonous elements present in Zamzam water (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-13267205">BBC Report)</a>. Please also read a detailed report on <a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Drinking_Zamzam_Water_and_its_Health_Risks">WikiIslam about Zamzam water</a>. </p>
<p>Moreover, Zamzam was full of snakes until Muhammad ordered their killing. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5251">Sunan Abi Dawud, 5251</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Al-Abbas said to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): We wish to sweep out Zamzam, but in it there are some of these Jinnan, meaning small snakes; so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered that they should be killed.</p>
<p>Grade: <strong>Sahih</strong> (Albani)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muslim preachers also don't tell why there were snakes in Zamzam. </p>
<p>While Pagans of Mecca also consider snakes to be one of their gods (just like Hindus consider snakes to be gods and worship them). Imam Tabari wrote that pagans of Mecca used to worship snakes in Zamzam, and used to give presents to them. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230307184726/http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/the-small-hajj-called-umra">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was also a serpent in the Kaabah, which lived in the well of the temple where the worshippers threw their gifts.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/the-small-hajj-called-umra#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[<em>Tarikh al-Tabari</em>, I, page 525</a>]  The serpents were considered by the Arabians to be Jinn and devils.<a title="" href="http://rrimedia.org/Resources/Articles/the-small-hajj-called-umra#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[<em>Taj Al Aruss</em>, I, pages 147 and 284</a>] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abdul Muttalib, who discovered the well of Zamzam, was himself an idol-worshipper, and he tried to sacrifice his son Abdullah (the father of Muhammad) for the sake of his idol gods. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008022324/http://www.brotherpete.com/index.php?topic=1784.msg7346">Link</a>). </p>
<h2>Why Don't Islamic Preachers Confirm the Healing Miracles of Zamzam Through Scientific Studies?</h2>
<p>Muhammad claimed many health benefits from Zamzam water. For instance, he claimed that drinking only Zamzam water for 30 days would cause weight gain.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2473a">Sahih Muslim, 2473a</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Dharr, who had stayed near the Ka’bah and its coverings for forty days and nights with no food or drink other than (Zamzam): “How long have you been here?” Abu Dharr said: “I have been here for <strong>thirty days and nights</strong>.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Who has been feeding you?” <strong>He said, “I have had nothing but <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1698">Zamzam water</a>, and I have gotten so fat that I have folds of fat on my stomach</strong>. I do not feel any of the tiredness or weakness of hunger and I have not become thin.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily, it is blessed, it is food that nourishes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, Islamic preachers repeat Muhammad's claims and attribute various health benefits to Zamzam water. However, they fail to back up their assertions with scientific evidence. They do not conduct scientific studies to verify Muhammad's claims about Zamzam's ability to cure diseases and alleviate hunger.</p>
<p>But why? Why do Islamic preachers refrain from proving their prophet's statements through scientific research? Is it because they fear that scientific studies might disprove their prophet's claims instead of validating them? If these studies were to confirm Zamzam's therapeutic properties, everyone would embrace Islam. On the other hand, if no such effects are found, Islamic preachers must cease spreading false tales and leave Islam altogether.</p>
<p>Think about it - if Zamzam truly possessed healing qualities against sickness and starvation, wouldn't Saudi Arabian hospitals be unnecessary?</p>
<p>&gt;And the truth is, there are poisonous elements present in Zamzam water (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-13267205">BBC Report)</a>.

			<title>The City of Iram and false claim of Quranic Miracle by Islamists</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://sachaai.com/index.php/en/hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/the-city-of-iram</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Muslim Preachers misused this hoax of the so-called Quranic miracle of the City of Irum, and brainwashed millions of innocent people into believing in Islam. But this is not a Quranic Miracle, but only a lie. </p>
<p>We just hope to bring innocent people out of this religious propaganda and show them the truth. </p>
<hr>
<p>The Qur'an says in Sura 89:6-8 (Yusuf Ali's translation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(Quran <a href="https://quran.com/89/6-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">89: 6-9</a>) </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the 'Ad (people),-</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Of the (city of) <strong>Iram</strong>, </span><strong>with lofty pillars, The like of which were not produced in (all) the land?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern Muslim preachers come up with this claim (<a href="https://aboutislam.net/reading-islam/understanding-islam/the-discovery-of-iram-city-was-mentioned-in-the-quran/">link 1</a>, <a href="https://awakemuslims.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/living-miracle-of-holy-quran-the-city-of-iram-has-been-unknown-to-history-was-recently-found/">link 2</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And this city of 'Ad (i.e. Iram), with tall pillars, was found in 1990 in Oman (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iram_of_the_Pillars">link</a>). </p>
<p>Thus, it is a miracle of the Quran, which told about this city, which was destroyed before the arrival of the prophet Muhammad and the Quran</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Actually, it has not been proven that this is the city of Iram.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Firstly: Prove that the pillars in the city of Iram are the tallest in the world</strong></span></p>
<p>Having few pillars does not automatically make it the city of Iram. But according to the Quran translation (which modern Muslims use to prove it to be a miracle), these pillars should be so long that no other pillars in the world should match them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran 89: 6-9)<br>Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with ‘Aad [With] Iram – who had <strong>lofty pillars, The likes of whom had never been created in the land</strong>?}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what is the height of these few pillars, and how Muslims declared them to be the tallest in the world?</p>
<p>The answer is that these pillars/towers are only 30 feet high (<a href="https://madainproject.com/ubar">link</a>). There are tons of ancient pillars/towers which are much higher than towers of Iram city. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>
<p>This excavation (which Muslims give the name of the city of Iram) does not have pillars, but only <strong>TOWERS (<a href="https://www.answering-christianity.com/city_of_iram_found.pdf">Link</a>). </strong></p>
<p>There is a huge difference between pillars (which are used for making BUILDINGS, and Towers. </p>
<p>And verse 89:7 used the word الْعِمَادِ, which has also been used in Hadith for Building </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2448a">Sahih Muslim, 2448a</a>:</p>
<p>قَالَتِ التَّاسِعَةُ زَوْجِي رَفِيعُ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>الْعِمَادِ</strong></span> طَوِيلُ النِّجَادِ عَظِيمُ الرَّمَادِ قَرِيبُ الْبَيْتِ مِنَ النَّادِي</p>
<p>The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>lofty building</strong></span>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Secondly: Salaf (i.e. Earlier) Muslims considered the people of 'Ad to be tallest in this verse, and not the pillars</strong></span></p>
<p>The modern Muslim preachers translated/interpreted verse 89:7 (إرم ذات العماد) as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Iram – who had <strong>lofty pillars</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the earlier Muslims interpreted this verse 89:7 (إرم ذات العماد) as (<a href="https://ahadees.com/english-surah-89.html">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people of Iram excessively tall</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it makes much more sense with tall people of 'Ad, who are unmatched in the land (in their height), as compared to the height of pillars. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Imam Qurtabi wrote under the commentary of this verse (</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;tSoraNo=89&amp;tAyahNo=7&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=2&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">):</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p> قال أبو عبيدة: «ذاتِ العِمادِ» ذات الطُّول. يقال: رجل مُعَمَّد إذا كان طويلاً. ونحوه عن ابن عباس ومجاهد.</p>
<p>Abu Ubaidah said, “Dhat al-Imad” (ذات العماد) in this verse means tall people. This phrase is said, (Rijl Mu'amed رجل مُعَمَّد) when a man is tall. Similar has been narrated from Hazrat Ibn Abbas and Mujahid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many more Islamic traditions, which claim that the people of 'Ad were the tallest. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thirdly: This city was destroyed only 100 to 300 years before Muhammad</strong></span></p>
<p>These pillars were built about 2000 years ago, and they were destroyed about 100 to 300 years before Muhammad. </p>
<p>The leader of the team of archaeologists, which discovered and worked on this excavation, wrote (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_of_the_Sands">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the direction of <a title="Juris Zarins" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Zarins">Juris Zarins</a>, the team began excavation, and within weeks had unearthed the wall and towers of a fortress dating back more than <strong>2,000 years</strong>. Clapp suggested that the evidence was "a convincing match" for the legendary lost city of Ubar. The city's destruction, he postulated, happened between <strong>A.D. 300 and 500</strong> as the result of an earthquake which precipitated the collapse of the limestone table</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Islam, there came no other prophet between Jesus and Muhammad. This is a period of 600 years.</p>
<p>So, how could the prophets come to 'Ad between 100 and 300 years before Muhammad, and the nation of 'Ad was destroyed due to those other prophets?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://questionsonislam.com/question/was-prophet-sent-between-jesus-and-muhammad-pbuh">https://questionsonislam.com/question/was-prophet-sent-between-jesus-and-muhammad-pbuh</a></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Was a prophet sent between Jesus and Muhammad (pbuh)?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Dear Brother / Sister,</p>
<p>It is stated in the historical sources that no prophet was sent between Jesus and Muhammad. This period is called as interregnum.</p>
<p>Salman (ra) said,</p>
<p><strong>"The interregnum between Jesus and Muhammad is 600 years."</strong> <em>(Bukhari, Manaqibu'l-Ansar 53)</em></p>
<p>The meaning of the interregnum in the hadith is the period between these two prophets when no prophet was sent by Allah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fourthly: The city was not destroyed due to any wind/sandstorm</strong></span></p>
<p>The Quran mentioned that the nation of 'Ad was destroyed by a violent wind/sand Strom (Verses 41:16, 46:24, 51:41, 54:19, 69:6).    </p>
<p>Later research on this excavation showed (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_of_the_Sands">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as the legend of Ubar was concerned, <strong>there was no evidence that the city had perished in a sandstorm</strong>. Much of the fortress had collapsed into a sinkhole that hosted the well, perhaps undermined by the removal of ground water for irrigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fifthly: The nation of 'Ad made buildings on EVERY height/hill (according to the Quran)</strong></span></p>
<p>Quran claims that 'Ad made buildings on EVERY hill. </p>
<p>Quran <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://quranx.com/26.128">26:128:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>أَتَبْنُونَ <span style="color: #ff0001;"><strong>بِكُلِّ</strong></span> رِيعٍ ءَايَةً تَعْبَثُونَ</p>
<p>What, you build a monument on <span style="color: #ff0001;"><strong>every</strong></span> hill merely for fun </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this so-called ruin (i.e. the city of Iram) is a very small place. So, where are the other buildings of 'Ad on the hills? </p>
<p>Off course, Muhammad was only copying pre-Islamic poets and Jewish folklore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">"However legendary a place Iram might have been, there are many references to Iram and 'Ad in pre-Islamic and Islamic poetry.3 The early anthology of mostly pre-Islamic poetry, the so-called Mufaddaliyyat, contain corroboration of Iram in pre-Islamic poetry: a verse, which has been attributed to Şuraym b. Ma'shar al-Taghlibi who probably lived in the second half of the sixth century (Sezgin 1996:150) and who is better known as Ufnun al-Taghlibi."</em></p>

<blockquote>

We shall follow him and kill you by his aid as 'Ad and Iram perished."</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sixthly: Muslim claim that the city of Iram was found in Ebla Tablets</strong></span></p>
<p>The <strong>Ebla tablets</strong> are a collection of as many as 1,800 complete clay tablets,  which were found in the ancient city of Ebla, in Syria. There is a mention of a city, with the name <strong>Ubar</strong> in them. Due to the similarity in the name, the Muslim preachers claimed that Ubar is the same city as the Iram of the Quran. </p>
<p>But the Ebla Tablets are 4500 to 4300 years old (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla_tablets">link</a>), while the excavation (which Muslims claim to be the city of Iram) is only 3000 years old (as mentioned above). </p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How can then these Ebla Tablets predict a city which is going to be formed 1300 to 1500 years later in the future?</strong></span></p>
<p>That is why Muslims failed to give any direct link to Ebla Tablets about the presence of any city of Iram in them. At the most, they cite a reference from National Geographic from 1978, which wrote:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The names of cities thought to have been founded much later, such as Beirut and Byblos, leap from the tablets. Damascus and Gaza are mentioned, as well as two of the Biblical cities of the plain, Sodom and Gomorrah. Also included is Iram, an obscure city referred to in Sura 89 of the Koran.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Please note that both Howard La Fay and National Geographic failed to give any direct quote from Ebla Tablets about Iram City. </p>
<p>Actually, Ebla Tablets were discovered only in 9174-1975 by (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla_tablets">link</a>). But then some sensationalist claims were made by <a title="Giovanni Pettinato" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pettinato">Giovanni Pettinato</a> and his team about the connection between the findings of Ebla Tablets and the stories of the Bible. It turned into a great controversy. </p>
<blockquote>

For example, Pettinato claimed to find references to Sodom and Gomorrah, but retracted his Zoar reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, National Graphics was unable to have any direct study to those Ebla Tablets about the City of Iram in 1978, and it relied on speculations of others for what it wrote in 1978. </p>
<p>Later, much of Pettinato's claims were found to be wrong. </p>

<p>In simple words, Muslim preachers are unable till today, to show any direct quote about the City of Irum from Ebla Tablets. </p>
<p>The archaeologists, who worked on this excavation, they talked about the <strong>city of Ubar</strong> (and not the city of Iram) in Ebla Tablets. Islamic preachers later claimed that Ubar is Iram, due to some resemblance in their names. </p>
<p>Moreover, this excavated city does not automatically become the city of Iram, while: </p>
<ul>
<li>Where did Ebla Tablets mention the tallest pillars of Iram?</li>
<li>And are these pillars/towers of the excavated city really the tallest? No, but it is only a random old ruin with some towers in it. On these criteria, every such ruin with some towers/pillars could be named the city of Iram. </li>
<li>Please also note, no Pillars were found in this excavated city of Ubar, but only TOWERS. There is a huge difference between pillars and towers. </li>
<li>And where did Ebla Tablets mention the nation of 'Ad in that city?</li>
<li>It is only wonder, how can then Islam apologists still claim that this excavation is the same as the city of Iram in the Quran. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>There is absolutely no solid proof present that this excavation is the same as the city of Iram which is mentioned in the Quran. </p>
<p>This location is only some random place with some pillars. How can then these modern Muslim preachers give it the name of the City of Iram?</p>
<p>Practically, Muslims can claim any ruin with pillars in it, to be the city of Iram. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>City of Iram VS Flat Earth Model in the Quran</h2>
<p>There is absolutely no proof present that these pillars belonged to the city of Iram and the nation of the 'Ad. Nevertheless, Muslims still do a lot of propaganda in its name.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Quran and the Hadith are full of the Flat Earth Model, but still these same Muslims deny these undeniable proofs.</p>

<p>Please compare both of these topics, and you will see the Double Standards of Islamic apologists. </p>]]></description>

<p>We need not waste our time and energy on such useless claims of numerical miracles in the Quran. </p>
<p>It would be better if we let Muslim scholars themselves refute such claims. The largest Muslim Fatawa website writes:</p>

<h2 class="has-text-weight-bold subtitle">Question</h2>
<div>I read some 'miracles' of the qur'an recently. These included many things such as the 3 stages of embryos, the orbits of planets, etc etc. However, one of them claimed that the word yawm (day) is mentioned 365 times in the qur'an, and the word qamar is mentioned 12 times in the quraan. I forget how many times the word ayyaam is mentioned. However, a friend pointed out that the islamic calender does not have 365 days in it. What does this mean about the islamic calender? That it is wrong? Or that God knew that most of the world would use the Gregorian calender and that this is a sign that it is the correct one?.</div>

<p>Praise be to Allah.</p>
<p>Firstly: </p>
<p>Many people are infatuated by the different types of miracles in the Qur’aan, including the “numerical miracles”. In newspapers and magazines and on the internet they publish lists of words that are repeated a number of times that corresponds to their structure, and words that are repeated the same number of times as their opposites. They also claim that the word yawm (day) is repeated 365 times and the word shahr (month) is repeated 12 times, and they do this with other words too, such as al-malaa’ikah (angels) and al-shayaateen (devils), and al-dunya (this world) and al-aakhirah (the Hereafter), etc.  </p>
<p>Many people think that these numbers are true and that this is one of the miracles of the Qur’aan, but they do not distinguish between subtleties and miracles. Writing a book which contains a specific number of certain words is something that anyone can do; what is so miraculous about that? ...</p>
<p>It should be noted that some people have taken this beyond mere statistics. Some of them have used these numbers to foretell when the state of Israel will fall, and others have used them to say when the Day of Judgement will be. One of the latest fabrications against the Book of Allaah is that which they have published saying that the Qur’aan foretold the explosions in the towers in New York! Based on the number of the verse in al-Tawbah, and the number of the soorah and juz’. All of that is toying with the Book of Allaah which is caused by ignorance of the true nature of the miracle of the Book of Allaah. </p>
<p>Secondly: </p>
<p>By examining the statistics presented by those who have published these numbers, we find that they did not get the numbers of some phrases right, and some of them have been selective in the way they counted the words, and that is so that they might reach the conclusion they want and that they think is in the Book of Allaah. </p>

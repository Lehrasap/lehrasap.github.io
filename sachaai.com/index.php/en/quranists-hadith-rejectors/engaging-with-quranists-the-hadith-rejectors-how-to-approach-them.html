        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The First Point: Avoid Engaging in Debates on Quranic Verse Interpretations with Quranists:</strong></span></p>
<p>It's essential to recognize that engaging in discussions regarding the interpretation of Quranic verses with Quranists is a futile endeavour. The Quran is intentionally ambiguous, allowing for multiple interpretations, and making it easy for Quranists to manipulate and distort its intended meaning. Their primary objective is to create doubt and confusion, rather than seeking truth or understanding. Therefore, avoid getting drawn into such debates, as they are destined to be unproductive. </p>
<p>Traditional Muslims also try to defend the Quran by changing the meaning of the Quranic verses, but still, they fail very often. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">When the proof is given from the Quran, and also supported by Hadith, then this combination makes it difficult for traditional Muslims to escape criticism, while Hadith is not as vague as the Quran is. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Moreover, proof from Fiqh (Jurisprudence) and history also make it even more difficult for traditional Muslims to escape criticism. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Second Point: Challenge Quranists why according to them the Quran "misguided" the billions of Muslims of the first 1400 years</strong></span></p>
<p>The Quranists may take advantage of the vague verses of the Quran and change their meaning. But the downside is, by doing so, they are also ultimately accusing billions of Muslims of the first 1400 years of being <strong>unanimously misguided</strong>. </p>
<p>But the question is: "Why did those billions of Muslims of the last 14 centuries misunderstand the Quran and get misguided?"</p>
<p>The Quran claims that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its verses are "easy to understand" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/54.17">54:17</a>)</li>
<li>Its verses are "clear", "manifest" and "guidance" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2">27:1-2</a>)</li>
<li>It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.2">12:2</a>)</li>
<li>It is a Book whose verses are perfectly explained—a Quran in Arabic for people who know (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/41.3">41:3</a>)</li>
<li>The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/2.185">2:185</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #e67e23;">Why did those billions of Muslims of the first 14 centuries still get misguided?</span><span style="color: #169179;"> </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #169179;">They firmly believed in this Quran from the depths of their hearts. </span><span style="color: #843fa1;">They read it day and night</span>. <span style="color: #ba372a;"><span style="color: #0f02ff;">They pondered upon it their entire lives. </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But if they still misunderstood it, and got misguided, then it is not the fault of those billions of Muslims of the last 14 centuries, but it becomes the fault of the Quran itself. Why was the Quran unable to guide them through this simple thing that Hadith is misguidance?</span></p>
<p>If the Quran is unable to guide billions of Muslims to a simple thing about the Hadith, and all of them unanimously got misguided after reading the Quran, how then this book be a guide for whole humanity?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Third Point: The negligence of Allah resulted in the "suffering" of millions </strong></span></p>
<p>Let us look at an example of slave women. There are only those Quranic verses present in the Quran, which tell that having sex with them is Halal (permissible). But there is not a single verse present in the Quran about the "human rights" of slave women.</p>
<p>It resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past 1400 years, millions of slave women were forced to roam in public without the Hijab and with exposed chests.</li>
<li>And all millions of captive/slave women were "raped" by Muslim men in a "Temporary" sexual relationship (like Shia Mut'ah). An owner fulfilled his lust by raping the slave girl, and then after getting bored with her, he sold her in the Islamic Bazaar of slavery. And then he bought himself a new slave girl and started raping her. Poor slave girls were sold multiple times, and they were multiple times raped by multiple different men. </li>
<li>The children of slave parents were also born automatically as slaves due to the evil of "Slavery by Birth" in Islam. When the babies got two molar teeth (at about the age of 6 months), they were separated from their slave mothers and were sold in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery. </li>
</ul>
<p>For details and proof, please read our article: <a href="../islamic-slavery/crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity.html">Part 1: The Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity</a></p>
<p>The questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Allah really knew the UNSEEN, and He knew that billions of Muslims are going to be misguided about slave women in the future, why didn't then Allah reveal one more verse in the Quran and declared the rape of slave women to be Haram clearly?</li>
<li>Yes, only one clear verse was needed to save millions of poor slave women from rape, which they had to undergo their entire life. </li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Millions of minor girls were married during the last 14 centuries, and they had to suffer and endure hardships.</li>
<li>While the so-called all-Knowing Allah didn't know that all Ahadith would make it Halal to marry a minor girl, including verse 65:4 of the Quran. </li>
<li>Quranists assert that those billions of Muslims of the last 14 centuries understood verse 65:4 wrongly. But this argument is not going to help them as the Quran claims its verses are CLEAR and EASY to understand. And those billions of Muslims were reading the Quran and day and night pondering upon it. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Quran is a huge voluminous book, but it is filled with only old fantasy tales and lofty claims about the greatness of Allah. Meanwhile, it has neglected the rights and well-being of humanity. </p>
<p>The Quranists can today claim whatever they like in order to shift the whole blame from the Quran to the Hadith and the Islamic Scholars, but the question will be asked about the Quran i.e. if Allah really knows the unseen, why didn't He cover the naked breasts of slave women in the Quran, or revealed a CLEAR verse that minor girls could not be married?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>More than 99.5% of Islamic Sharia (which makes Islam and its followers dangerous) came through Ahadith. Hatred Sharia Rulings against non-Muslims are also present in the Quran, they are still a tiny amount of Sharia Rulings. Moreover, the Quranic verses are "vague", and it is easy to neutralize such verses by giving them different meanings. Unfortunately, it is the "combination" of the Quranic verses with Ahadith and the history of Islam, which becomes dangerous.</p>
<p>One of the significant contributions of the Quranists is their effort to reform Islam by reinterpreting certain verses of the Quran that have been used to justify violence, oppression, and discrimination. By challenging the traditional understanding of these verses, they have opened up new possibilities for a more inclusive and compassionate interpretation of Islam. </p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>Their message of rejecting Hadith is not "effective". That is why, they never succeed in attracting many Muslims towards them. They make up perhaps not even 1% of the Muslim population. They failed miserably in reducing the overall danger of radical Islam. </p>
<p>The Quran and Hadith have some weak points and human errors. These human errors can be utilized by non-Muslims, in order to show people that there exists no Allah in the heavens and that Muhammad was making the revelations on his own. And since Muhammad was only a human, we see these <strong>human errors</strong> in the revelation too. But there, the Quranists jump in, and they "sugarcoat" the dangerous or errored Quranic verses. This causes people to become confused, and they become unable to see the real face of Islam. </p>
<p>In an ideal world, the Quranists can become beneficial for humanity, if they "Debate" with traditional Muslims only, and make them leave that part of the dangerous Sharia, which is based upon Hadith. Unfortunately, the Quranists don't engage other Muslims too much, but they are found much more engaged in debating with non-Muslims and defending Islam by "sugarcoating" the horrible verses of the Quran. </p>
<p>For example, if we criticize Islam, then not only do we have to face the traditional Muslims, but the Quranists also immediately jump in and attack us. This is like fighting on two different fronts at the same time. At this time, you will not see a clash between the traditional Muslims and the Quranists, but both of them unitedly try to refute us. </p>
<p>Thus, the NET result is negative. This behaviour of the Quranists is harming humanity, and traditional Muslims are taking benefit of this behaviour directly or indirectly. </p>
<p>That is why, it becomes immensely important to neutralize the Quranists immediately during discussions so that we only have to fight on one front against traditional Muslims. </p>

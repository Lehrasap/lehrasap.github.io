			<description><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Summary:</strong></h2>
<p>Hindutva followers claim that it were the Vedic (Hindu) gods who created the earth, and then created the mankind. Off course they deny the Human Evolution completely, as all other religions in this world. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, modern scientific facts prove that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hinduism started at a maximum of only about 3500  years ago. And it were the Aryans, who created this religion after migrating to India from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe">European Steppe</a>.  These Aryans were said to have introduced key elements of Indian culture such as the Sanskrit language – which gave rise to the Indo-Aryan branch of languages spoken all across north, west and east India today – as well as the Vedas, the foundational texts of Hinduism.</li>
<li>But modern Hindutva movement deny all that. They deny any Aryan Invasion, but claim that all Indian population is indigenous one, and the migration took place from India towards the European Steppe. </li>
</ul>
<p>How Did Scientists Reach These Conclusions? Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>No Evidence of Hinduism Before 3500 Years Ago</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no mention of Hinduism or the Vedic religion in Indian history older than 3500 years.</li>
<li>Archaeologists have found <strong>no <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">cave paintings</span>, no <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">artifacts</span>, no <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">sculptures</span>, no <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">inscriptions</span>, no <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Hindu Temples</span>, and no <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Sanskrit language</span></strong> in ancient India (which is older than 3500 years) that indicate the existence of Hinduism or Vedic practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indus Valley Civilization Lacked Hindu Influence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation"><strong>Indus Valley Civilization (IVC)</strong></a>, which thrived around 4000 years ago, has yielded <strong>numerous seals, sculptures, and other artifacts</strong>.</li>
<li>However, <strong>there is no evidence of the Vedas, Hindu temples, Hindu gods, or the Sanskrit language</strong> in any of the findings from this civilization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNA Evidence Supports Aryan Migration Theory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Genetic studies have found traces of <strong>Aryan DNA in the present Hindu population</strong>.</li>
<li>Interestingly, this Aryan DNA is <strong>only present in the male lineage</strong>, suggesting that only <strong>Aryan male warriors migrated or invaded, conquered India, and interbred with the local women</strong>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indus Valley People Had No Aryan DNA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DNA analysis of ancient skeletons from the Indus Valley <strong>shows no traces of Aryan ancestry</strong>.</li>
<li>This supports the theory that <strong>the Aryans arrived after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization</strong>, eventually establishing dominance over the region and shaping later Indian culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(251, 238, 184);">Cave Paintings:</span></h2>
<p>Hindutva followers claim that the Vedic gods were the oldest deities who created the world and that the Vedic civilization was the most ancient, known for its superior craftsmanship. However, if this were true, why do depictions of Vedic gods not predate 3500 years, while numerous other paintings and statues from different civilizations, much older than 3500 years, have survived?</p>
<p>Despite these claims, <strong>there is no evidence of Hinduism</strong> in India that is older than 3500 years. No <strong>Hindu temples, sculptures of Hindu gods, cave paintings, or any other archaeological proof</strong> exist from before this period. <span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_paintings_in_India">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_paintings_in_India</a></p>
<p>The history of cave paintings in India or rock art range from drawings and paintings from prehistoric times, beginning around 30,000 BCE in the caves of Central India, typified by those at the Bhimbetka rock shelters. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Rock_Shelter_8%2C_Bhimbetka_02.jpg/1200px-Rock_Shelter_8%2C_Bhimbetka_02.jpg" width="734" height="489"></p>
<p>There are tons of such cave paintings etc. are present (which are older than 3500 years), but absolutely no proof of Vedic culture is present. </p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(251, 238, 184);"><strong>Indus Valley Civilization &amp; DNA Evidence</strong></span></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>DNA Analysis of Indus Valley Civilization (IVC):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A 2019 genetic study (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(19)30967-5.pdf">link</a>)  analyzed the DNA of a Harappan woman from Rakhigarhi, one of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilization.</li>
<li>The results showed <strong>no traces of Aryan (Steppe) DNA</strong> in the Harappan population, meaning the people of IVC had no genetic link to the later Aryan arrivals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genetic Shift in Modern Indians:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In contrast, present-day Indians have <strong>about 10% to 20% Aryan (Steppe) DNA</strong> (<a href="https://caravanmagazine.in/science/after-harappans-influx-steppe-dna-south-asia-vagheesh-narasimhan?utm_source=chatgpt.com">link</a>).</li>
<li>This suggests a significant genetic transformation after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Aryan Migration/Invasion Theory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists explain this genetic shift as the result of <strong>Aryans migrating/invading from the Russian Steppe</strong>, leading to the collapse of the IVC around 4000 years ago (Reference: <a class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group" href="https://www.livescience.com/59703-north-india-populated-by-central-asian-invaders.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="truncate">livescience.com</span></a>).</li>
<li>DNA studies confirm that <strong>only Aryan males migrated to India</strong>—no Steppe-origin women were found in the genetic pool. This means, as conquerors, <strong>Aryan males</strong> had privileged access to local women, while indigenous men were marginalized. This led to a <strong>significant presence of Steppe male DNA  in modern Indians</strong>, while the maternal lineage remained indigenous. This genetic evidence strongly supports the theory that <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Aryans arrived in India after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, reshaping its demographics and cultural landscape.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(251, 238, 184);">No Hindu gods were found in Harappa or Mohenjo-Daro Archeaological Sites</span></h2>
<p>Although Hindutva followers claim that Indus Valley Civilization was a Vedic Society, but they have not even a single proof to back up this claim. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absence of Hindu gods in the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of toys, seals, and idols were discovered in Harapa or Mohenjo-Daro achaeological sites, however, not a single statues or depictions of Hindu gods were found.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Hindu temples in the IVC</strong>
<ul>
<li>While many houses were found in the IVC, not a single Hindu temple has been discovered in Harappa or across the entire Indus Valley.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, the oldest Hindu temple (all across the Indian Subcontinent), that has been found is the <strong>Mundeshwari Temple</strong>, located in Kaimur district of Bihar, India. It is believed to date back to <strong>108 CE</strong>, making it only about <strong>1,900 years old</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <strong>oldest known statue of a Hindu or Vedic deity (across all over India)</strong> is the <strong>Shiva Lingam</strong> found at <strong>Gudimallam</strong>, Andhra Pradesh, India. This <strong>Shiva Lingam</strong> dates back to the <strong>3rd–2nd century BCE</strong> (around 2000 years old) and is considered one of the earliest representations of a Hindu deity. </p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(251, 238, 184);">The Pashupati Seal: A Critical Examination</span></h2>
<p>The <strong>Pashupati Seal</strong>, discovered in the <strong>Indus Valley Civilization</strong>, has sparked significant debate among historians, archaeologists, and religious groups. While some <strong>Hindutva followers</strong> claim it as evidence of <strong>Vedic or Hindu religion</strong> in the Indus Valley, a closer examination reveals that these claims are speculative and lack solid evidence. Let’s break down the arguments and analyze them critically.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is the Pashupati Seal?</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="float-end" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Shiva_Pashupati.jpg/330px-Shiva_Pashupati.jpg" alt="Pashupati Seal" width="244" height="245">The <strong>Pashupati Seal</strong> is a small steatite seal excavated from <strong>Mohenjo-Daro</strong>, a major site of the Indus Valley Civilization (circa 2600–1900 BCE). It depicts a figure seated in a cross-legged posture, surrounded by animals such as elephants, tigers, and buffaloes. Some scholars have interpreted this figure as a proto-Shiva, specifically in his <strong>Pashupati</strong> (Lord of Animals) form. However, this interpretation is not universally accepted and remains a subject of debate.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hindutva Claims About the Pashupati Seal</strong></span></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>Animals and Shiva’s Association</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hindutva supporters argue that the presence of animals on the seal aligns with Shiva’s role as the <strong>Lord of Animals (Pashupati)</strong>. They claim this similarity proves the figure is Shiva.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Yogic Posture</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They also point out that the figure is seated in a posture resembling <strong>Yoga</strong>, and since Shiva is considered the <strong>master of Yoga</strong>, this further supports their claim.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response to These Claims</strong></span></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Repetition</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thousands of seals and artifacts have been unearthed from the Indus Valley, but <strong>only one</strong>—the Pashupati Seal—shows a figure resembling Shiva. If Shiva were a central deity of the Indus Valley people, we would expect to find <strong>multiple depictions</strong> of him across various artifacts. The absence of such evidence weakens the claim.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Direct Link to Shiva</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><img class="float-end" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://ii1.pepperfry.com/media/catalog/product/b/r/1100x1210/brown-polyresin-and-bronze-lord-shiva-padmasana-idol-by-ecraftindia-brown-polyresin-and-bronze-lord--y9dqdr.jpg" width="230" height="253">The figure on the seal bears no resemblance to later depictions of <strong>Shiva</strong> in Hindu iconography. For example, Shiva is typically shown with specific attributes like a <strong>trident (trishul)</strong>, a <strong>crescent moon</strong>, or a <strong>serpent</strong>, none of which appear on the seal. The identification of the figure as Shiva is based solely on the presence of animals, which is not conclusive evidence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speculative Interpretation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The idea that the figure represents Shiva is a <strong>hypothesis</strong>, not a proven fact. Scholars have proposed other interpretations, such as the figure being a <strong>shaman</strong>, a <strong>proto-yogi</strong>, or a <strong>local deity</strong> unrelated to Hinduism. Without deciphered Indus Valley scripts, these interpretations remain speculative.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Yoga in the Indus Valley</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no guarantee that the figure is sitting in a <strong>Yogic posture</strong>. If the Indus Valley people practiced Yoga, we would expect to find <strong>multiple seals or artifacts</strong> depicting similar postures. However, no such evidence exists. The Pashupati Seal stands alone, making it an unreliable basis for claiming the presence of Yoga in the Indus Valley.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Comparison with Celtic God Cernunnos</strong></h3>
<p><img class="float-end" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Gundestrupkedlen-_00054_%28cropped%29.jpg/450px-Gundestrupkedlen-_00054_%28cropped%29.jpg" width="350" height="238" border="0">Interestingly, the figure on the Pashupati Seal bears a stronger resemblance to the <strong>Celtic god Cernunnos</strong> than to <strong>Lord Shiva</strong>. Cernunnos, a deity from Celtic mythology, is depicted with <strong>horns</strong>, surrounded by animals, and seated in a posture similar to the Pashupati Seal. He is associated with fertility, prosperity, and the <strong>Lord of Animals</strong>, much like the figure on the seal.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cernunnos</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cernunnos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about Cernunnos on Wikipedia</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, <strong>Lord Shiva</strong> in Hindu iconography is never depicted with horns, and his Yogic postures differ significantly from the figure on the seal. This raises questions about the validity of linking the Pashupati Seal to Shiva.</p>
<p>Thus, the <strong>Pashupati Seal</strong> is an intriguing artifact, but it cannot be considered definitive proof of the presence of <strong>Hinduism</strong> or <strong>Vedic religion</strong> in the Indus Valley Civilization. The claim that it depicts Shiva is based on conjecture rather than concrete evidence. To assert that the Indus Valley people followed Hinduism based on this single seal is an overreach.</p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(251, 238, 184);">DNA of the present Indian Population</span></h2>
<p>Present Indian population is a mixture of 3 ancestral groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ancient Ancestral South Indians</li>
<li>The people of the Indus Valley Civilisation</li>
<li>People who migrated from the Pontic Steppe (commonly known as Aryans). </li>
</ol>
<p>None of these three groups exist today but it is their mixing that caused most of the modern Indian population to be formed.</p>
<p>Of these, the Ancient Ancestral South Indians were present across parts of the subcontinent that did not fall under the Indus Valley Civilisation. Their closest modern-day relatives are the tribes of the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Of these, the Indus Valley had no Steppe DNA. They mainly had a mixture of Iranian-farmer-related DNA as well as some DNA from Ancient Ancestral South Indians. In 2019, a latest research study  came out about the DNA sequencing of a woman from Indus Valley civilisation. <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(19)30967-5.pdf">Here is the link to this study (link)</a>. <strong>This proves that Aryan Invasion happened after the Indus Valley Civilisation had already been destroyed some 4000 years ago</strong>.</p>
<p>Of these, the 3rd group, the Steppe population came in from grasslands in Eastern Europe corresponding to modern-day Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan. The genetic research identifies that this Steppe ancestry burst into India during a “narrow time window” dated between 2,000 BC and 1,500 BC.</p>
<h3>The impact of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists</h3>
<p>On 6th September 2019, a  scientific study was published at <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/eaat7487">Science (link)</a> by Dr. Reich's and his team<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/eaat7487">.</a> They<em> </em>took a macro view, analysing genetic data from 523 ancient people spanning 8,000 years across Central and South Asia right up to the European Steppe –<strong> the largest study of ancient human DNA</strong>. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://scroll.in/article/936872/two-new-genetic-studies-upheld-aryan-migration-theory-so-why-did-indian-media-report-the-opposite">summary (by scroll.in) </a>of the findings is as under:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><img title="Yamnaya" src="https://i.redd.it/2x3vwf1xfda61.jpg" alt="The impact of Yamnaya Steppe Pastoralists" width="1145" height="596"></p>
<p>The spread of the Steppe pastoralists and their descendants across ancient Eurasia. The Steppe population is identified here using the name Yamnaya which refers to an ancient archaeological culture on the Pontic Steppe. It is the Yamnaya people who spoke the a language which was the ancestor of every Indo-European language in existence today, be it Bhojpuri or Welsh. The arrows show plausible routes while the years refer to rough estimates of when the Yamnaya and their descendants arrived in a place. Source: The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Once these Steppe people entered India, a great churning ensued. They mixed with the Indus Valley people to create what is now called the Ancestral North Indian grouping. However, a significant portion of the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation were pushed south when the Steppe people entered. They then mixed with the Ancient Ancestral South Indians to form a group known as the Ancestral South Indian population.</p>
<p>For the next 2,000 years, <a class="link-external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3769933/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Indians mixed freely</a>. As a result, most modern South Asians are some mix of Ancestral North Indian and Ancestral South Indian. However, this great churning stopped around 1,900 years ago when Indian society calcified <a class="link-external" href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/08/india-s-fragmented-society-was-once-melting-pot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">into thousands of endogamous groups</a> who do not intermarry across caste lines – a societal structure <a href="https://scroll.in/article/897802/how-same-caste-marriages-persisted-for-thousands-of-years-in-india-and-are-still-going-strong">maintained till today</a>.</p>
<p>In South Asia, the Indo-European language family bought in by the Steppe people forked to give rise to the Indo-Aryan daughter branch. The first Indo-Aryan language in South Asia was Vedic Sanskrit, the language of the Rig Veda.</p>
<p>Much of this Steppe ancestry is male, the research shows. This means that Steppe migrants “were more successful at <a class="link-external" href="http://nautil.us/issue/58/self/social-inequality-leaves-a-genetic-mark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">competing for local mates</a> than men from the local groups” – which tells us something about the aggressive nature of Indo-Aryan migration into India. The <em>Science</em> paper concludes that there was an “asymmetric social interaction between descendants of Steppe pastoralists and peoples of the Indus Periphery Cline [Indus Valley Civilisation]”.</p>
<p>In simpler language, <a class="link-external" href="http://nautil.us/issue/58/self/social-inequality-leaves-a-genetic-mark" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">David Reich</a> explains that the preponderence of male Steppe DNA means that this encounter between the Steppe pastoralists and the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation “cannot have been entirely friendly”.</p>
<p>This male bias is standard for Indo-European migration. In fact, when these Steppe pastoralists reached Europe, Reich’s research found an even larger proportion of male Steppe genes. In large parts of Western Europe, Steppe migrants almost completely displaced local males in a short time span, leading to one Danish archeologist postulating that the coming of these Indo-European speakers “<a class="link-external" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24132230-200-story-of-most-murderous-people-of-all-time-revealed-in-ancient-dna/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">must have been a kind of genocide</a>”.</p>
<p>This pattern, wrote David Reich in his 2018 book <em>Who We Are and How We Got Here, “</em>is exactly what one would expect from an Indo-European-speaking people taking the reins of political and social power 4,000 years ago and mixing with the local peoples in a stratified society, with males from the groups in power having more success in finding mates than those from the disenfranchised groups”.</p>
<p>This ancient encounter is, incredibly, reflected even in the present-day Hindu caste system, with Steppe DNA<strong> </strong>correlated with upper-caste status<strong>.</strong> “Groups that view themselves as being of traditionally priestly status, including Brahmins who are traditional custodians of liturgical texts in the early Indo-European language Sanskrit, tend (with exceptions) to have more Steppe ancestry than expected on the basis of ANI-ASI mixture<strong>,” </strong>says the research in <em>Science</em>.</p>

<h2><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(251, 238, 184);">Hindutva Claims About the Sunken City of Dwarka</span></h2>
<p>Hindutva supporters often claim that the sunken city of Dwarka is <strong>proof of an 8,000-year-old Hindu civilization</strong>. They argue that Hindu religious scriptures describe Dwarka as the city of Krishna and that modern underwater discoveries confirm these ancient texts. Some even provide so-called “neutral sources” and documentaries to support their claims.</p>
<p>But let’s take a step back and examine the facts.</p>
<h3><strong>What Have Archaeologists Actually Found?<img class="float-end" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20220519062406/https://mahabharata-research.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/dwarka-underwater-city.jpg?etag=W%2F%2210b8d-59abf135%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fjpeg&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=750%2B498&amp;extract=0%2B0%2B564%2B498&amp;quality=85" width="272" height="240"></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>So far, <strong>not a single Hindu god, temple, or artifact linked to Hinduism</strong> has been discovered in Dwarka.</li>
<li>The <strong>Mahabharata</strong> describes Dwarka as a city with <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>900,000 royal palaces</strong></span> made of <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>crystal and silver</strong></span>, decorated with <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>emeralds</strong></span>.</li>
<li>The city supposedly had <strong>grand roads, marketplaces, assembly houses, and temples</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But when archaeologists investigated, what did they actually find?</p>
<p><strong>A few underwater stones.</strong> That’s it.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong> No crystal, no silver, no emeralds</strong></span>—just some scattered ruins, like many other sunken settlements across the world.</p>
<p>So where is the <strong>evidence</strong> that this was the <strong>mythical Dwarka</strong> described in Hindu scriptures? The truth is, Hindutva narratives rely more on religious mythology than real archaeology.</p>
<h3>Hindutva's False Propaganda About Dwarka's Underwater Ruins</h3>
<p>Be cautious of Hindutva's misleading claims about the so-called grand underwater ruins of Dwarka. They have been circulating fake images on such a massive scale that it has become difficult for an average person to find accurate information online.</p>

<p>In reality, no grand structures have been discovered. Only a few scattered underwater stones have been found, as shown in this <a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20220113-dwarka-indias-submerged-ancient-city"><strong>BBC report (video)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these deceptive images have been <strong>fact-checked by the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-fact-check/news/fact-check-these-photos-arent-proof-of-sri-krishnas-dwarka-in-gujarat/articleshow/71385329.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Times of India (link)</a></strong>, confirming that they are false.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Hindutva has tried to twist history to fit its agenda. When no historical evidence supports their claims, they either:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stretch the truth</strong> by misinterpreting findings.</li>
<li><strong>Use religious texts as "historical records"</strong> instead of actual archaeology.</li>
<li><strong>Cherry-pick vague discoveries</strong> and ignore contradicting evidence.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bottom line? The <strong>real Dwarka</strong>, if it existed, is <strong>nothing like the grand city described in the Mahabharata</strong>. What Hindutva presents as "evidence" is little more than an attempt to rewrite history for ideological purposes.</p>

<h2>Excuse of <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Voluntary Act</span> by Hindutva supporters for Sati</h2>
<p>The most common excuse from Hindutva supporters is that Sati was purely a voluntary act. This image highlights the mindset of modern Hindutva followers:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://sachaai.com/images/Sati_woman_India.png" alt="Sati of Women in India" width="334" height="334" loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/Sati_woman_India.png"></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">EXPECTATION</span> vs. Voluntary Act</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s face it: there is no such thing as a truly voluntary act when society places even the slightest <strong>EXPECTATION</strong> on you. Practices like Sati and wearing the Hijab are not free choices—they’re chains, cleverly disguised as traditions or religious duties.</p>
<p>The moment society, your family, or your community <strong>EXPECTS</strong> something from you, it becomes psychological coercion. Forget physical force—this EXPECTATION creates an invisible prison. </p>
<p>Thus, although Hindutva argues that Sati was a choice, but this ignores the reality of social and religious pressure. Unlike women accused of crimes—who at least had a chance to escape execution if proven innocent—widows were given no such opportunity. Their fate was often sealed the moment their husbands died.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Religious INDOCTRINATION</span> vs. Voluntary Act</strong></h4>
<p>When a Jihadist does a suicide bombing out of his own freewill and choice (without any person forcing him to do so), is it called a voluntary act or blamed as a result of religious brainwashing? </p>
<p>Imagine a society where death is normalized as an option, where some women are raised to believe that burning themselves alive on their husband’s pyre is not just acceptable but divinely ordained. Think about the generations of brainwashing that would make suicide seem like a righteous, even sacred act. It doesn’t matter whether it’s called "choice." When women are conditioned to see this as their <span style="color: rgb(230, 126, 35);"><strong>moral duty</strong></span>, it’s not freedom—it’s oppression dressed up as tradition.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4 data-start="0" data-end="56"><strong data-start="0" data-end="54">The Horrific Life of a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Widow</span>, If Not Dying in Sati</strong></h4>
<p data-start="58" data-end="712">Let’s face the brutal truth: if a woman didn’t "choose" Sati, her life didn’t get any better. If she survived, she would be condemned to live as a widow in a society that had no mercy for her. She couldn’t remarry, no matter how young or desperate she was for companionship or care. She was often isolated, stigmatized, and left to struggle with nothing—no support, no future. Her life was reduced to a shadow of what it once was. Society made sure of it. There was no dignity, no second chance, no escape from the cruel fate of being a widow. She wasn’t allowed to mourn or move on; she was forced to live in a constant state of humiliation and despair.</p>
<p data-start="58" data-end="712"> </p>
<h4 data-start="58" data-end="712"><strong>A "Voluntary" Act at the <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Cost of Small Children</span>?</strong></h4>
<p data-start="714" data-end="1329" data-is-last-node="">And let's ask the hard question: what about the children? If the mother was allowed to commit Sati, what would happen to her small children? Who would care for them? In a society that expects a woman’s death as a duty, her children would often be left orphaned, abandoned, with no hope of a better life. Their fate wasn’t considered when this so-called "choice" was glorified as a sacred duty. All that mattered was upholding tradition, no matter the human cost. This wasn’t about free will; it was about a system that stripped women of their rights and their futures, all while pretending to uphold sacred values.</p>
<p data-start="714" data-end="1329" data-is-last-node=""> </p>
<h4><strong>Why did no <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">MAN</span> ever commit SATI as a Sacred &amp; Voluntary Act?</strong></h4>
<p>Ask yourself: why was Sati always "sacred &amp; voluntary" for women and never for men? Why didn’t men throughout history get the so-called "option" to burn themselves on their wife’s pyre? Defenders of this barbaric practice remain silent because there are no answers—this was never about choice, or virtue, or anything else, except for a senseless practice to glorify the religion, just like slaughtering animals in the name of gods. The difference? This one demanded human lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Sati vs. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Modern Assisted Suicide</span></strong></h4>
<p>Modern <strong>Hindutva supporters</strong> try to deflect criticism of the practice of <strong>Sati</strong> by pointing to the West’s acceptance of <strong>assisted suicide</strong>, claiming it’s a case of <strong>double standards</strong>. They argue that both practices are about "choice," and therefore, if one is acceptable, the other should be too. But this comparison is not only flawed—it’s dangerously misleading. Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assisted suicide is rooted in <strong>compassion</strong> and the right to die with dignity, after rigorous psychological and medical evaluations to ensure the decision is informed and free from coercion. Importantly, assisted suicide is a <strong>human effort to make the painful process of dying as <span style="color: rgb(5, 0, 255);">PAINLESS</span> and <span style="color: rgb(5, 0, 255);">PEACEFUL</span> as possible</strong>. It is about reducing suffering, not adding to it.</li>
<li>Sati, on the other hand, was a practice rooted in <strong>patriarchy</strong> and <strong>cultural coercion</strong>. It was not about relieving suffering but about enforcing societal expectations on widows, often under immense psychological and social pressure. Moreover, burning <span style="color: rgb(5, 0, 255);"><strong>ALIVE</strong></span> in fire is perhaps <strong>one of the most agonizing and <span style="color: rgb(5, 0, 255);">PAINFUL</span> and <span style="color: rgb(5, 0, 255);">non-PEACEFUL</span> forms of death imaginable</strong>. It is the exact opposite of a painless, dignified end.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Sati vs. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">LOVE</span> Argument</strong></h4>
<p>You will often see the following kind of love argument by Hindutva supporters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I watched my maternal grandmother cry for YEARS. She was and empty shell of a human being for a long long time. Deep down, I suspect she would have committed Sati if it was legal at the time. Modern degenerates who have 20 sex partners before marriage wouldn't know true love even if it hit them in the skull with a hockey stick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often Hindu Kings were marrying multiple women and having multiple concubines for love, but Hindu wives had to self-immolate themselves in the name of same love.</li>
<li><strong style="font-size: 1rem;" data-start="5" data-end="120">Many Rajput warriors (not just kings, but wealthy nobles and feudal lords, known as Thakurs, Ranas, and Rawats)</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> also had </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem;" data-start="130" data-end="178">multiple wives and concubines (slave girls).</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> While kings had grand harems, even Rajput nobles and warriors followed similar practices, though on a smaller scale. Marrying multiple women was considered a <strong data-start="496" data-end="513">status symbol</strong> in Rajput culture.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong data-start="1014" data-end="1039">Tawaifs (Courtesans):</strong> While not exactly slaves, many Rajput nobles maintained relationships with courtesans.</span></li>
<li data-start="1523" data-end="1668">While Rajput men could have multiple wives and concubines, Rajput women were <strong data-start="1622" data-end="1666">expected to remain loyal to one husband.</strong></li>
<li data-start="1669" data-end="1772">Widows were <strong data-start="1683" data-end="1712">forbidden from remarrying</strong> and were often pressured into <strong data-start="1743" data-end="1770">Sati (self-immolation).</strong></li>
<li data-start="1773" data-end="1827">Women had <strong data-start="1785" data-end="1805">little to no say</strong> in these marriages.</li>
</ul>
<p>If love was the factor, why then in Indian history (or in Hindu sacred books) husbands were never found committing Sati for their wives?</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Sati Burning vs.</strong> <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>Witch Burning</strong></span></h4>
<p data-start="63" data-end="261">Whenever Sati is criticized, modern Hindutva supporters try to deflect by bringing up witch burnings in medieval Europe, as if that somehow justifies their own past. Let’s set the record straight.</p>
<p data-start="263" data-end="681">First, <strong data-start="270" data-end="367">we—modern, secular, non-religious people in the West—are not responsible for burning witches.</strong> We don’t even believe witches ever existed. The so-called "witches" who were burned were just innocent women, victims of religious fanaticism. And guess what? We openly condemn the religious people who carried out those atrocities, and we <strong data-start="607" data-end="642">criticize their religious books</strong> for containing such dangerous ideas.</p>
<p data-start="683" data-end="1054">Now, compare that to modern Hindutva supporters. Instead of condemning their own religious texts that glorified and encouraged Sati, they defend them. Instead of acknowledging the brutality of their past, they try to point fingers elsewhere. That’s the difference. We reject and criticize the horrors committed in the name of religion, while they try to justify theirs.</p>
<p>And let’s talk about historical facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last reported case of Sati in India - 1987</li>
<li>The last reported case of Witch Burning in Europe - 1782</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h4>Sati: Just a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Local Tradition</span> or a part of Hindu Religious Texts?</h4>
<p>Modern Hindutva supporters love to claim that <strong data-start="115" data-end="153">Sati was just a regional tradition.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s cut through the noise and expose the lies: <strong>Sati wasn’t just some "local tradition"</strong>—it was a widespread, deeply rooted practice encouraged and glorified in <strong>Hindu scriptures</strong>. Modern Hindutva supporters want to whitewash history, claiming Sati was rare or unrelated to Hinduism. But the facts tell a different story.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Hindu Scriptures</span> Glorified Sati:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rig Veda (10.18.7)</strong>: The oldest Hindu text mentions widows lying beside their dead husbands on the pyre. Later edits softened the language, but the original intent was clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Garuda Purana (Chapter 10, Verses 91-92)</strong>: Explicitly glorifies Sati, claiming a widow who burns herself purifies her family and earns heaven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mahabharata (Anusasana Parva, Chapter 146)</strong>: Praises queens who committed Sati, framing it as the ultimate act of wifely devotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manusmriti (5:160)</strong>: While it doesn’t outright demand Sati, it makes a widow’s life so miserable—no remarriage, no joy—that death seems like the only escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Padma Purana, Agni Purana, Vishnu Dharmasutra</strong>: These texts either endorse or celebrate Sati. If it wasn’t tied to Hinduism, why do these scriptures praise it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hindutva supporters claim Sati was limited to Bengal or Rajasthan. That’s false. Historical and archaeological evidence shows it was widespread:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>South India</strong>: Ancient Tamil inscriptions describe women being burned alive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu</strong>: Sati stones (memorials for women who committed Sati) are found across these regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Nepal</strong>: Records show Sati was practiced here too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It wasn’t rare—it was everywhere.</p>
<p>Why the denial? Because Hindutva supporters want to sanitize history, pretending Hinduism has never oppressed women. But history doesn’t lie. Instead of rewriting the past, they should <strong>acknowledge it and move forward</strong>. Denial won’t erase the truth.</p>
<p>We encourage all to check out the following article, which compiles all references to Sati from Hindu scriptures, along with details on the eras and regions where it was practiced:</p>

        <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></h1>
<p>Not accepting Muhammad as a prophet was one thing, but the main crime of the Jews was that they EXPOSED Muhammad as a false prophet. It was an unforgivable crime.</p>
<p>The irony was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad claimed that Islam was a continuation of the Abrahamic traditions of Judaism and Christianity. This led many people to approach the Jewish community to validate his claims.</li>
<li>However, Jews got the strongest arguments against Muhammad. Instead of confirming Muhammad's prophethood, they got in a position, where their arguments were totally exposing Muhammad. </li>
</ul>
<p>Muhammad had no answer to the Jewish arguments. His only option was to get rid of the Jews either by killing them, or through expelling them from Medina. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The TEST of "Miracle of Fire":</strong></span></h2>
<p>Following the migration to Medina, Muhammad initially sought to win favour with the Jews by altering the Qibla from Ka'ba (in Mecca) to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayt_al-Maqdis_(disambiguation)">Bait al-Maqdis </a>(in Jerusalem) and incorporating many Jewish rulings into Islamic Sharia. However, this effort at appeasement quickly turned into deep-seated enmity and animosity.</p>
<p>The turning point came when: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Jews challenged Muhammad to perform the "Miracle of Fire," a test commonly associated with prophethood claims in the Bible.</li>
<li>Muhammad and his Allah failed to produce such a miracle, leading to widespread disbelief among the Jewish community in Medina.</li>
<li>Earlier, Muhammad also failed in Mecca to answer the 3 questions, that were asked by the Jews. </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, their exposure of Muhammad as a false prophet marked the end of Jewish appeasement and the onset of intense anger and hostility towards them.</p>
<p>The Bible contains several passages that highlight the phenomenon of divine acceptance of a person's sacrificial offering through the appearance of a mysterious fire that consumes the offering. These instances can be found in verses such as Judges 6:20-21, 13:19-20, and 2 Chronicles 7:1-2.</p>
<p>Actually, Muhammad had already made a mistake, and he had also previously confirmed this method of the miracle of fire in the Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.27">5:27</a>, in the story of Adam and his sons, where a fire appeared and consumed the offering of one son who sacrificed a sheep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/5.27"> 5:27</a>:</p>
<p>Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one (by fire consuming one of them), but not from the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tafsir Tabari, under verse 5:27 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=3&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was narrated from as-Suddi, in his narration from Abu Maalik and from Abu Saalih from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Murrah from Ibn Mas‘ood, and from some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ... Habeel (Abel) offered a fat lamb as his offering, while Qabeel (Cain) presented a sheaf of corn but secretly took out and consumed a large portion of the corn. Subsequently, fire descended from the heavens and consumed Habeel's offering, while Qabeel's offering remained untouched and unaccepted. In response, Qabeel became enraged and threatened to kill Habeel, vowing that he would not allow him to marry his sister.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220428104808/https://dorar.net/h/808e9bbf2bff4252bd3830e50578ec2d"> Sahih (Albani)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, when Muhammad asserted his prophethood, the Jews asked him to provide proof through the manifestation of a miracle, specifically the fire consuming his offering.</p>
<p>Muhammad found himself unable to dismiss this demand outright, as he already acknowledged it in the story of Adam in the Quran.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad resorted to a different approach, offering a new excuse. He accepted the validity of the miracle involving the fire accepting the offering, but he refused to showcase this miracle. He justified his inability to show this miracle by accusing the Jews of Medina that their forefathers sinned by killing previous prophets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/3.183?context=3"> 3:183</a>:</p>
<p>They (the Jews) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in any messenger <strong>unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire</strong> (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: <strong>why then did ye slay them</strong>, if ye speak the truth?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this excuse by the writer of the Quran does not hold up under scrutiny as it is unjust to punish individuals for the sins of their ancestors. In this case, the writer of the Quran is essentially claiming to hold the Jews of his time accountable for the actions of their forefathers. This contradicts the concept of divine justice, which does not attribute guilt based on lineage.</p>
<p>Secondly, the writer of the Quran contradicts his own claims within the text. The Quran repeatedly asserts that the practices of Allah remain unchanging. Yet, in this instance, Muhammad is deviating from that principle by rejecting the miracle of fire as a valid proof of prophethood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>:</p>
<p>[This is] the established way of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Muhammad's Failure to answer (or even to <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 9);">UNDERSTAND</span>) the 3 Questions that Jews asked him</h2>
<p>Earlier, when Muhammad was in Mecca, the Jews asked Muhammad 3 questions as a test of his prophethood. However, <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Muhammad and his Allah not only failed to answer those 3 questions, but they were even unable to <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 9);"><strong>UNDERSTAND</strong></span> those 3 questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Please note:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Not knowing the answers is one thing.</li>
<li>Providing incorrect answers is even worse.</li>
<li>However, not even comprehending the questions is the worst possible outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Muhammad and his Allah made this critical error by failing to understand the original questions.</p>
<p>The Jews asked Muhammad the following 3 Questions from<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16484"> The Book of Denial</a> (The Bible).</p>
<table style="width: 100.015%; height: 1014.13px;" border="1"><colgroup><col style="width: 1.36519%;"><col style="width: 55.3754%;"><col style="width: 43.2594%;"></colgroup>

<td style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); height: 143.988px;">
<p>The Jews asked Muhammad about the "<strong>Spirit of God <span class="mw-page-title-main"><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/الروح_القدس">الروح القدس</a></span></strong>" in the context of the Book of Daniel (i.e. if Daniel <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/دانيال"><span dir="rtl">دانيال</span></a> was a prophet or not despite the fact that the Spirit of God showed him "Visions").  </p>
<p>A significant dispute arose when the Christians regarded Daniel as a prophet, as the Spirit of God had shown him visions, whereas the Jews did not. Consequently, the Jews believed that if Muhammad was truly a prophet of God, he would be able to resolve this disagreement.</p>
</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); height: 143.988px;">
<p>However, Muhammad (and his Allah) didn't have any clue about the original question, and he thought it about "Human Spirit". Thus Muhammad gave a VAGUE answer in the Quran:<em> </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Spirit belongs to the domain of my Lord; and you were given only little knowledge (Quran 17:85).”</em></p>
</blockquote>
</td>

<tr style="height: 474.196px;">

<td style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); height: 474.196px;">
<p>The Jews then asked Muhammad and his Allah about a story from the Book of Daniel (Bible), which was a dream involving a ram with two horns.</p>
<p>Firstly, the verse 3 to 4 are telling about the VISION about the ram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 8:3-4: <br></strong>I looked up (in the vision), and there before me was a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>ram with two horns</strong></span>, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. I watched the ram as it charged toward <span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);"><strong>the west and the north and the south</strong></span>. <strong>No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power</strong>. It did as it pleased and became <strong>great</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the verse 20 gave the interpretation of the VISION:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 8:20: <br></strong><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 9);">The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia</span> </strong>...<span id="en-NIV-21985" class="text Dan-8-23">“In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise.</span> <span id="en-NIV-21986" class="text Dan-8-24">He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people.</span> <span id="en-NIV-21987" class="text Dan-8-25">He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); height: 474.196px;">
<p>Muhammad (and his Allah) mistakenly believed this was about <strong>Alexander the Great</strong>, who was also historically known as "<strong>the Two-Horned One</strong>."</p>
<p>This story is found in Surah Al-Kahf (Chapter 18) of the Quran, verses 83-101.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 359.95px;">
<td style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); height: 359.95px;"> 3</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); height: 359.95px;">From the Book of Daniel, the Jews also asked the 3rd question about the story of 3 young believing (Jewish) men who were thrown into the fire, but they survived as a miracle.</td>
<td style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); height: 359.95px;">
<p>Muhammad and his Allah incorrectly assumed that the Jews were asking about the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seven-Sleepers-of-Ephesus">Legend of 7 Sleepers of Ephesus</a> (i.e. The people of the Cave). This legend was not even a part of the Bible, but only a later days Christian legend. And Jews could not ask about this Christian legend, as it was about PIOUS Christian faithful men, which goes against Jewish beliefs. </p>
<p>Additionally, Muhammad (and his Allah) also became confused about the NUMBERS of people, while:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original story in the Book of Daniel involved 3 young men.</li>

<li>Thus, Muhammad gave a vague answer that actual numbers is not necessary as their numbers are from 3 to 8. </li>

<h2>Muhammad's Frustration as not even 10 Jews believed in his prophethood</h2>
<p>This frustrated Muhammad so much, that he used to say even if 10 Jews believed in him, then all Jews would become Muslims. </p>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">[Note: Islamic apologists make lame excuses to prove that Muhammad said "10 Jewish Scholars/Leaders". You can see these lame excuses and their refutation here in this article: <a href="../islam-general/tehrif-distortion-in-english-translations-of-islamic-texts.html">A LIST of Tehrif (Distortions) in English Translation of Islamic Texts</a>]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Thus the Jews of Medina still refused to accept him as a true prophet, and that was the point where Muhammad's enmity and hatred started against the Jews:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, Muhammad changed the Qibla once again from Bait-ul-Muqqadas to Ka'ba in Mecca. </li>
<li>Then he started openly threatening the Jews to accept Islam, otherwise, they would be expelled from Medina, and he would snatch away all of their lands by force. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3167">Sahih Bukhari, 3167</a>:</p>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">While we were in the Mosque, the Prophet (ﷺ) came out and said, "Let us go to the Jews" We went out till we reached Bait-ul-Midras. He said to them,<span style="color: #0007ff;"><strong> "If you embrace Islam, you will be safe.</strong></span> You should know <span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong><span style="color: #e67e23;">that the earth</span> <span style="color: #e67e23;">belongs to Allah and His Apostle (only)</span></strong></span>,<span style="color: #007008;"><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">and I want to expel you from this land.</span></strong></span> So, if anyone amongst you owns some property, he is permitted to sell it, <span style="color: #007008;">otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle</span>."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>Yes, that was the whole argument of Muhammad: "...<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong><span style="color: #e67e23;">that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle (only)</span></strong></span></span> ..."</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Please remember that Muhammad used the same argument to attack innocent Pagan tribes (who had nothing to do with Muhammad previously and had never attacked or harmed Muhammad). </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3012:</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Narrated As-Sab bin Jaththama: The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me at a place called Al-Abwa or Waddan, and was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." Prophet said: <span style="color: #e67e23;"><em><strong>All the graze-lands belong to Allah and his prophet.</strong></em></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Later Muhammad's anger and hatred against the Jews went so high that he was no more satisfied by expelling them from Medina, but he wanted to expel them from the whole Arab peninsula. It was due to the reason that it was a shame for him that he was claiming himself to be the promised prophet of the Jews, but the Jews were telling people that he was not that promised prophet. Muhammad didn't want the Jews to tell this to others, thus he wanted to expel them from the whole Arabian peninsula. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/32/75">Sahih Muslim, 1767(a)</a>:</span></p>
<p>It has been narrated by 'Umar b. al-Khattib that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and will not leave any but Muslim.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>And this hatred against Jews goes till the last hour, where Muhammad asked his followers to kill all Jews: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2922">Sahih Muslim, 2922</a>:</p>
<p>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Muhammad cursed the Jews even more than polytheist pagans: </h2>
<p>Can you believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad cursed the Jews more than the polytheist Meccan pagans.</li>
<li>And Muhammad also killed the Jews many times more than the polytheist Meccan pagans, although it were Meccan Pagans who used to torture Muhammad and Muslims, and fought wars with Muhammad. But the Jews of Medina neither tortured a single Muslim nor killed anyone of them. </li>
</ul>
<p> All this started after the incident of the "miracle of fire":</p>
<p>Sins and Punishments :</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The Jews wronged themselves (Quran 16:118)</li>
<li>by losing faith (7:168) and breaking their covenant (Quran 5:13).</li>
<li>The Jews (echoing an ante-Nicaean, Marcionite polemic) are a nation that has passed away (Quran2:134; repeated in 2:141).</li>
<li>Twice Allah sent his instruments (the Assyrians/or Babylonians, and Romans) to punish this perverse people (Quran 17:4-5)</li>
<li>—their dispersal over the earth is proof of Allah’s rejection (Quran 7:168).</li>
<li>The Jews are further warned about both their arrogant claim that they remain Allah’s chosen people (Quran 62:6),</li>
<li>and continued disobedience and “corruption” (Quran 5:32-33; 5:64)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other sins, some repeated, are enumerated:</p>
<ul>
<li>abuse, even killing of prophets (Quran4:155; 2:91),</li>
<li>including Isa (Jesus) (Quran 3:55; 4:157),</li>
<li>is a consistent theme. The Jews ridiculed Muhammad as Ra’ina (the evil one, in Quran 2:104; 4:46),</li>
<li>and they are also accused of lack of faith, taking words out of context, disobedience, and distortion (Quran 4:46).</li>
<li>Precious few of them are believers (also Quran 4:46).</li>
<li>These “perverse” creatures also claim that Ezra is the messiah and they worship rabbis who defraud men of their possessions (Quran 9:30).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional sins are described:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Jews are typified as an “envious” people (2:109),</li>
<li>whose hearts are as hardened as rocks (2:74).</li>
<li>They are further accused of confounding the truth (2:42),</li>
<li>deliberately perverting scripture (2:75),</li>
<li>and being liars (2:78).</li>
<li>Ill-informed people of little faith (2:89),</li>
<li>they pursue vague and wishful fancies (2:111).</li>
<li>Other sins have contributed to their being stamped (see 2:61/ 3:112)</li>
<li>with “wretchedness/abasement and humiliation,” including usury (2:275), sorcery (2:102),</li>
<li>hedonism (2:96),</li>
<li>and idol worship (2:53).</li>
</ul>
<p>More (and repeat) sins, are described:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Jews’ idol worship is again mentioned (4:51),</li>
<li>then linked and followed by charges of other (often repeat) iniquities-the “tremendous calumny” against Mary (4:156),</li>
<li>as well as usury and cheating (4:161).</li>
<li>Most Jews are accused of being “evil-livers” / ”transgressors” / ”ungodly” (3:110),</li>
<li>who, deceived by their own lies (3:24),</li>
<li>try to turn Muslims from Islam (3:99).</li>
<li>Jews are blind and deaf to the truth (5:71),</li>
<li>and what they have not forgotten they have perverted.</li>
<li>They mislead (3:69),</li>
<li>confound the truth (3:71),</li>
<li>twist tongues (3:79),</li>
<li>and cheat Gentiles without remorse (3:75).</li>
<li>Muslims are advised not to take the Jews as friends (5:51),</li>
<li>and to beware of the inveterate hatred that Jews bear towards them (5:82).</li>
<li>The Jews’ ultimate sin and punishment are made clear: they are the devil’s minions (4:60)</li>
<li>cursed by Allah, their faces will be obliterated (4:47) if they do not accept the true faith of Islam.</li>
<li>The Jews who understand their faith become Muslims (3:113).</li>
<li>They will be made into apes (2:65/ 7:166),</li>
<li>or apes and swine (5:60),</li>
<li>and burn in the Hell fires (4:55, 5:29, 98:6, and 58:14-19).</li>

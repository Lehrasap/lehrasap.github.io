<p style="text-align: left;">Due to evolution, our bodies produce and release hormones which make us happy when we love, or do good to others, or we feel empathy towards others.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let us see this scientific study, which shows that origin of morality is innate:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124201903000454</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Abstract</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Is there an innate moral sense? Scientific evidence, from child development, linguistics, and behavioral economics to neuroscience, moral psychology, and primatology reveals universal drives that constitute a biologically prepared moral architecture within human nature. This innate moral sense is akin to the innate predisposition for smell or language and suggests human beings are born with the prototypes of a sense that fosters anxiety when they witness others in distress and, similarly, promotes positive feelings when that distress is alleviated. Incorporating the concept of an innate moral sense into our models of social and political life would improve ethical analysis.<br>Nobody tells a baby how to love his/her mother. These are the hormones which are making a baby love his/her mother automatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shortly after you give birth, your doctor will place your baby against your chest. This moment of skin-to-skin contact is important — and often overwhelming — for both mom and baby. Feeling your touch and hearing your voice calms your baby and makes him feel safe. During this skin-to-skin moment, your body releases oxytocin.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In particular, when women give birth, there's a big surge of oxytocin, and oxytocin is also released during breastfeeding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oxytocin has been called the "love hormone," even though its effect isn't always that lovely. It's thought to deepen the bond that a mom has with her newborn. But what about the dads, who don't get pregnant or breastfeed? It turns out that a father's interactions with his children produce a similar rise in oxytocin levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Researchers have found that emotionally involved fathers feel other hormonal effects: higher levels of prolactin, a lust-squelching hormone that shows up in women during breastfeeding and in men after sexual climax; and higher levels of vasopressin, a hormone linked to bonding as well as the maternal stress response.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It turns out that fathers get many of the same rushes that mothers do from parenthood — but the payoff depends on proximity and interaction. For example, researchers see the effect if the child sleeps with the parents, if the father recognizes and responds to the baby's cries, if Dad plays with the kids. When that proximity isn't present, the fatherhood effect isn't as strong.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even when we are grown up, our minds decide if any action is good or bad on the basis of this empathy i.e. if we are doing good to others with our action, or if we are hurting them with our action.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, later, there are other factors involved too like social upbringing, religious brainwashing etc. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, in an adult person, morality is no longer completely innate. An adult person's own moral views are influenced primarily by three things: empathy, enlightened self-interest, and social pressures. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> In the case of babies, instincts such as empathy and the trust in the parent are a larger influence on their morality than they might be for an adult, and due to the lower intelligence and perceptiveness of a baby the social influences on their morality are weaker than they will be as the child grows and begins to interact more with society.</p>

<section>
<p>It's a classic tale, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge -- the epitome of selfishness, the quintessential mean-spirited, miserly, narcissistic old man. Yet as Scrooge discovers the joy of good deeds, he blooms with the "helper's high" - and his spirit is reborn. And a merrier man had never been seen, as the story goes.</p>
<p>In the last few years, researchers have looked at the so-called helper's high and its effects on the human body. Scientists are searching to understand just how altruism -- the wish to perform good deeds -- affects our health, even our longevity.</p>
<p>Acts of heroism are one form of altruism -- as we saw on 9/11, when firemen rushed into the World Trade Center. Many firemen, chaplains, and citizens joined the rescue and recovery effort, working grueling 12-hour shifts.</p>
<p>In everyday life, countless people choose to give up free time to volunteer -- whether it's serving at soup kitchens, cleaning up litter, taking elderly people to the grocery store, or helping a next-door neighbor.</p>
<div class="responsive-sharethrough-wrapper"> </div>
<p>What prompts a human being to act heroically? What makes us perform good deeds? When we act on behalf of other people, research shows that <em>they</em> feel greater comfort, less stress. But what about the do-gooder's physiology -- how is it affected? Can doing good make us healthier, as a growing number of scientists now believe? Can it even, as studies suggest, help us <a href="https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/ss/slideshow-longer-life-secrets" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="slideshow">live longer</a>?</p>
<p>This is the focus of 50 scientific studies funded through The Institute for Research on Unlimited Love, headed by Stephen G. Post, PhD, a professor of bioethics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. It is a comprehensive investigation of altruism, aka benevolence, compassion, generosity, and kindness.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="1-2">The Innate Need to Do Good</h2>
<p>It's no surprise that, when we're on the receiving end of love, we reap a benefit. "There are ample studies showing that when people receive generosity and compassion, there is a positive effect on their health and well-being," Post tells WebMD.</p>
<p>Examples: "When a compassionate physician creates a safe haven for the ill patient, the patient experiences relief from stress," he explains. "One study showed that when men felt loved by their wives, they were less likely to experience <a href="https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/whats-causing-my-chest-pain" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">chest pain</a> that might signal a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-heart-attacks" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">heart attack</a>."</p>
<p>Only in recent years have researchers explored the scientific underpinnings of the notion that "doing good" is indeed a good thing -- and precisely <em>why</em> it is good for us. Indeed, many scientific disciplines -- evolution, genetics, human development, neurology, social science, and positive <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/guide-to-psychiatry-and-counseling" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">psychology</a> -- are at the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/heart/picture-of-the-heart" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">heart</a> of this investigation, says Post.</p>

<h2 id="2-3">Linking Kindness and Health</h2>
<p>In a paper published earlier this year, Post describes the biological underpinnings of stress -- and how altruism can be the antidote. This connection was discovered inadvertently in 1956, when a team of Cornell University researchers began following 427 married women with children. They assumed that the housewives with more children would be under greater stress and die earlier than women with few children.</p>
<p>"Surprisingly, they found that numbers of children, education, class, and work status did not affect longevity," writes Post. After following these women for 30 years, researchers found that 52% of those who did not volunteer had experienced a major illness -- compared with 36% who did volunteer.</p>
<p>Two large studies found that older adults who volunteered reaped benefits in their health and well-being. Those who volunteered were living longer than nonvolunteers. Another large study found a 44% reduction in early death among those who volunteered a lot -- a greater effect than <a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">exercising</a> four times a week, Post reports.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, one famous study examined personal essays written by nuns in the 1930s. Researchers found that nuns who expressed the most positive emotions were living about 10 years longer than those who expressed the fewest such emotions.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="2-4">The Science of Altruism</h2>
<p>When we engage in good deeds, we reduce our own stress -- including the physiological changes that occur when we're stressed. During this stress response, hormones like cortisol are released, and our heart and breathing rates increase -- the "fight or flight" response.</p>
<p>If this stress response remains "turned on" for an extended period, the immune and cardiovascular systems are adversely affected -- weakening the body's defenses, making it more susceptible to abnormal cellular changes, Post explains. These changes can ultimately lead to a downward spiral -- abnormal cellular changes that cause premature aging.</p>
<p>"Studies of telomeres -- the end-caps of our genes -- show that long-term stress can shorten those end-caps, and shortened end-caps are linked with early death," he tells WebMD. "These studies indicate that we're dealing with something that's extremely powerful. Ultimately, the process of cultivating a positive emotional state through pro-social behaviors -- being generous -- may lengthen your life."</p>

<section>
<p>Altruistic emotions -- the "helper's high" -- seem to gain dominance over the stress response, Post explains. The actual physiological responses of the helper's high have not yet been scientifically studied. However, a few small studies point to lowered stress response and improved immunity (higher levels of protective antibodies) when one is feeling empathy and love.</p>
<p>In one study, older adults who volunteered to give <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">massage</a> to infants had lowered stress hormones. In another study, students were simply asked to watch a film of Mother Teresa's work with the poor in Calcutta. They had significant increases in protective antibodies associated with improved immunity -- and antibody levels remained high for an hour afterward. Students who watched a more neutral film didn't have changes in antibody levels. "Thus, 'dwelling on love' strengthened the immune system," writes Post.</p>

<h2 id="3-6">Compassion in the Brain</h2>
<p>There's evidence in <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/picture-of-the-brain" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">brain</a> studies of a "compassion-altruism axis," Post tells WebMD. Utilizing functional <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/science-good-deeds" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">MRI</a> scans, scientists have identified specific regions of the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/ss/slideshow-concussions-brain-injuries" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="slideshow">brain</a> that are very active during deeply empathic and compassionate emotions, he explains. A new mother's <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/rm-quiz-amazing-brain" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="tools">brain</a> -- specifically, the prefrontal lobe -- becomes very active when she looks at a picture of her own baby, compared to other babies' pictures.</p>
<p>"This is extremely important," Post says. "This is the care-and-connection part of the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/video/brain-training" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="video">brain</a>. It is a very different part of the brain than is active with romantic love. These brain studies show this profound state of joy and delight that comes from giving to others. It doesn't come from any dry action -- where the act is out of duty in the narrowest sense, like writing a check for a good cause. It comes from working to cultivate a generous quality -- from interacting with people. There is the smile, the tone in the voice, the touch on the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/picture-of-the-shoulder" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">shoulder</a>. We're talking about altruistic love."</p>
<p>Brain chemicals also enter into this picture of altruism. A recent study has identified high levels of the "bonding" hormone oxytocin in people who are very generous toward others. Oxytocin is the hormone best known for its role in preparing mothers for motherhood. Studies have also shown that this hormone helps both men and women establish trusting <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/default.htm" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">relationships</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-7">The Evolution of Kindness</h2>
<p>"Humans have evolved to be caring and helpful to those around us, largely to ensure our survival," says Post. "In Darwin's <em>Descent of Man</em>, he mentions survival of the fittest only twice. He mentions benevolence 99 times."</p>
<p>Humans are mammals, and like other mammals we are social animals. As we evolved, our social bonds helped ensure our survival, explains Harvard psychiatry associate professor Gregory L. Fricchione, MD. Fricchione is working on a book about brain evolution and the development of human altruism.</p>
<p>"If it is evolutionarily beneficial for human beings to benefit from social support, you would expect that evolution would provide the species with the capacity to provide social support," he tells WebMD. "This is where the human capacity for altruism may come from."</p>

<h2 id="4-8">The Impact of Genetics and Environment</h2>
<p>An interplay of our genetics and our environment - especially in our early years - will play into whether we develop into altruistic individuals. "It's a bit like the traits of shyness and extroversion; people are found at all parts of the spectrum. You would expect that some people would have the capacity to be more altruistic than others -- and some preliminary findings that suggest how this capacity may emerge," says Fricchione, who is also associate chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p>
<p>He's referring to a small study published recently, which looked at oxytocin levels in children's urine while they interacted with their parents. One group was composed of orphans who had spent the first 16 months of life in overseas orphanages - neglected before being adopted by U.S. families. The other group of kids had been raised in stable, caring homes during their earliest years.</p>
<p>The adopted orphans had produced lower levels of urinary oxytocin after being with their mothers, compared with children raised in nurturing homes since birth. "This may be a clue to a 'window of opportunity' in children's development, that those who grow up to be empathic, caring, and more altruistic in later life were nurtured more in their earlier years," Fricchione says. "That nurturing may help develop the altruistic capacity."</p>
<p>Future research might focus on whether the experience of being well cared for in early childhood could enhance the development of so-called "mirror neurons" that enable us to have empathic responses to the emotional states we witness in others, he says.</p>

<h2 id="5-9" style="text-align: left;">The Healing Hormone</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, oxytocin may be connected to both physical and emotional well-being, says Fricchione. "Oxytocin is the mediator of what has been called the 'tend-mend' response, as opposed to the 'fight-flight' response to stress. When you're altruistic and touching people in a positive way, lending a helping hand, your oxytocin level goes up - and that relieves your own stress."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In one animal study, researchers looked at the numerous effects that oxytocin can produce in lab rats -- lower <a href="https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/diastolic-and-systolic-blood-pressure-know-your-numbers" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">blood pressure</a>, lower levels of stress hormones, and an overall calming effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Altruistic behavior may also trigger the brain's reward circuitry -- the 'feel-good' chemicals like dopamine and endorphins, and perhaps even a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3891/morphine+injection/details" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">morphine</a>-like chemical the body naturally produces, Fricchione explains. "If altruistic behavior plugs into that reward circuitry, it will have the potential to reduce the stress response. And if the altruistic behavior continues to be rewarding, it will be reinforced."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Again, Scrooge is a good example, says Post. "He comes alive because of his benevolent affections and emotions. What's really happening is that he's tapping into the whole neurology, endocrinology, and immunology of generosity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"All the great spiritual traditions and the field of positive psychology are emphatic on this point -- that the best way to get rid of bitterness, anger, rage, jealousy is to do unto others in a positive way," Post tells WebMD. "It's as though you somehow have to cast out negative emotions that are clearly associated with stress -- cast them out with the help of positive emotions."</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Summary:</h2>
<p>In the first part of this series, we discussed how Allah set a highly challenging TEST for humans, one that is almost IMPOSSIBLE for billions of people born into non-Muslim families by Allah's Design to pass. Consequently, these 99.9999% of people are doomed to eternal hellfire.</p>
<p>But what about Allah? Did He pass His own TEST?</p>
<p>Muhammad claimed that Allah exists in the heavens. However, neither Allah nor any angel has appeared to us directly. The only way to verify Allah's existence would be through witnessing a miracle from Him as proof. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pagans and Jews of Muhammad's time frequently demanded that Muhammad show them even the smallest miracle as proof of Allah, promising to convert to Islam if they saw such evidence.</li>
<li>This demand was consistent with stories of earlier practices, where prophets demonstrated miracles as proof of their prophethood and divine mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Muhammad and his Allah failed to pass this TEST. They were unable to show even the tiniest miracle to the pagans and Jews.</p>
<p>Muhammad and his Allah offered several EXCUSES in the Quran for their inability to produce even the slightest miracle.</p>
<p>Let us examine these excuses and determine if they hold any weight.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 1st Quranic Excuse: Muhammad cannot show a Miracle while he is only a human</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident occurred in Mecca. Muhammad used to threaten the Meccans, warning them to believe in his prophethood or face the consequences, claiming that his Allah would make the sky fall upon them in fragments. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>: And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "...  <strong>Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">AS YOU HAVE (previously) CLAIMED</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Actually, the pagan Meccans not only accepted this challenge by Muhammad but also extended it and asked Muhammad to show other miracles too and they would believe in his prophethood. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, Muhammad/Allah failed to deliver on this promise.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, Muhammad was forced to come up with an <strong>EXCUSE</strong> for his failure to fulfil his promise and show any miracle. And he made the following excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring. Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the sky fall upon us in fragments <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>as you have (previously) claimed</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read." <strong> Say: "Glory to my Lord. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(I cannot do it while)</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">I am only man and a messenger</span></em></span></strong></span>." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer of the Quran (i.e., Muhammad himself) attempted to justify his failure to perform miracles by claiming that he was merely a messenger and could not perform miracles.</p>
<p>However, the pagan Meccans had issued this challenge not only to Muhammad <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but also to Muhammad's god <span style="color: #2800ff;">(i.e., Allah was already automatically included in this challenge)</span></strong></span>. They believed that if Allah truly existed, He should have demonstrated a miracle to them.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was Muhammad/Allah who promised that the sky would fall upon them if they didn't believe in Muhammad's prophethood. Yet, both Muhammad and his Allah failed to fulfill their promise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Muhammad's lack of miracles was due to his role as a mere messenger, why did previous prophets demonstrate miracles to validate their prophethood? For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, Cured the blind and the leper and gave life to the dead by God’s permission (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.110">5:110</a> and <a href="https://quranx.com/3.49">3:49</a>).</li>
<li>Moses received nine miracles, including his staff transforming into a dragon, his hand becoming radiant, the plague of locusts/lice, the swarm of frogs, and the parting of the sea for the Children of Israel (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.101">17:101</a>).</li>
<li>Solomon comprehended the language of animals and birds and controlled jinn and winds (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.16?context=2">27:16-17</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/34.12?context=2">34:12-13</a>),</li>
<li>while Joseph interpreted dreams and predicted future events (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.46?context=2">12:46-47</a>, <a href="https://quranx.com/40.51?context=2">40:51-52</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the Meccans were correct in their demand. Even the Quran mentioned their argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/21.5">21:5</a>: So let him bring us a sign just <strong>as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles].</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So, if the earlier prophets were able to demonstrate miracles despite being humans, why then Muhammad could not?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And then the Quran claims that Allah does not change his PRACTICE (i.e. Sunnah):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.77">17:77</a>:</strong> This has been Our Way with the Messengers whom We sent before you. You will find <strong>no change</strong> in our <strong>Practice</strong> (i.e. the Sunnah of Allah).</p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>:</strong> [This is] the established practice of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the Practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>:</strong> <strong>But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quran presents a contradiction regarding the expectation of miracles from prophets. In one instance, it suggests that prophets are not required to display miracles as evidence of their prophethood, yet in another, it describes earlier prophets performing miracles to prove their legitimacy. This raises a question: Why did earlier prophets show miracles to disbelievers, but Muhammad and his Allah refused to do so?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that the Quran recounts fictional tales of earlier prophets' miracles, which cannot be verified since they took place in the distant past. Conversely, when it came to Muhammad and his Allah, they were expected to perform miracles in real-time, right before the very eyes of the Kuffar Meccans who challenged them. However, they failed to deliver on these expectations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The 2nd Quranic Excuse: Allah would not send a miracle to Muhammad this time while nations of earlier prophets denied the miracles of earlier prophets</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident also happened in Mecca.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58-59</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَسْطُورًا</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلْءَايَٰتِ إِلَّآ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ</span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And We <span style="color: #e03e2d; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REFRAIN </strong></span>from sending the signs (now in front of Kuffar Meccans), <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only because the men of former generations treated them as false</strong></span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meccans repeatedly asked Muhammad for a miracle, but he always offered new excuses for not delivering one. Earlier Muhammad claimed he could not perform any miracle while he was only a human being. But that excuse was shaky as the challenge was not limited to Muhammad only, but his god (i.e. Allah) was also automatically included in that challenge. </p>
<p>Thus, Muhammad was forced to change his excuse. This time, he came up with a new excuse that Allah had ceased sending new miracles/signs since earlier people rejected them.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, Allah's practice (i.e. Sunnah of Allah ) supposedly changed when earlier people denied the signs. However, this contradicts the Quranic CLAIM that Allah's Sunnah never changes.</p>
<p>As they say, where there's a contradiction, there's a lie.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's worth noting that there's also a flaw in Verse 58:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.59?context=2">17:58</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad recounted various tales in the Quran about ancient prophets like Thamud, 'Aad and Saleh etc., describing how their communities were destroyed by Allah. Muhammad presumed that nobody could fact-check his accounts by journeying into the past. However, he made a critical error.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that, according to the Quran, Jesus also performed miracles in front of the Jews and Romans. He spoke as an infant in the cradle, gave life to birds made of clay, cured the blind and the leper, and even brought the dead back to life, all by God's permission (Quran 5:110 and 3:49). Yet, neither the Jews nor the Romans believed in him. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Despite this, neither the Jews nor the Romans of Jesus's era were destroyed </strong></span>(<span style="color: #0000ff;">which again goes against the Quranic Promise of Destruction</span>).</p>
<p>The incident of Jesus took place in the recent past, making it feasible to verify its authenticity through historical records. Thus, this claim in the Quran has been exposed as a lie.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The 3rd Excuse: Muhammad shouldn't ask Allah for a Miracle while Allah had misguided the Pagans</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the previous two excuses naturally failed to satisfy people regarding Muhammad's/Allah's inability to show any miracle. They continued to ask Muhammad to bring a miracle as proof of his prophethood. To deflect their demand, Muhammad introduced another excuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>He (Muhammad) cannot ask Allah for any miracle because Allah does not want the pagans to be guided.</li>
<li>And if he (Muhammad) persists in asking Allah for a miracle, then Allah will punish him, and he (Muhammad) will be among the ignorant.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/6/35/default.htm">6:35</a>:</p>
<p>وَإِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكَ إِعْرَاضُهُمْ فَإِنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتَ أَن تَبْتَغِىَ نَفَقًا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ أَوْ سُلَّمًا فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَأْتِيَهُم <strong>بِـَٔايَةٍ</strong> ۚ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَمَعَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ ۚ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ</p>
<p>If you (O Muhammad) find rejection by the unbelievers so unbearable, then seek a tunnel into the ground or a ladder into the sky in order to bring them a <strong>SIGN</strong>, but [remember that], <strong>had God willed it</strong>, <strong>He would have guided all of them. Do not be among the ignorant (by asking a SIGN from Allah)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more, this verse serves as evidence that no miracle was shown to the Meccan disbelievers by Muhammad/Allah. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2>The 4th Quranic Excuse: Muhammad will not show the miracle to the Jews while their forefathers sinned</h2>
<p>This incident happened just after Muhammad's migration to Medina when he had to prove his prophethood to the Jews of Medina. </p>
<p>The Bible contains several passages that highlight the phenomenon of divine acceptance of a person's sacrificial offering through the appearance of a mysterious fire that consumes the offering. These instances can be found in verses such as Judges 6:20-21, 13:19-20, and 2 Chronicles 7:1-2.</p>
<p>Actually, Muhammad had already made a mistake, and he had also previously confirmed this method of the miracle of fire in the Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.27">5:27</a>, in the story of Adam and his sons, where a fire appeared and consumed the offering of one son who sacrificed a sheep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/5.27"> 5:27</a>:</p>
<p>Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one, but not from the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tafsir Tabari, under verse 5:27 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=3&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was narrated from as-Suddi, in his narration from Abu Maalik and from Abu Saalih from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Murrah from Ibn Mas‘ood, and from some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ... Habeel (Abel) offered a fat lamb as his offering, while Qabeel (Cain) presented a sheaf of corn but secretly took out and consumed a large portion of the corn. Subsequently, fire descended from the heavens and consumed Habeel's offering, while Qabeel's offering remained untouched and unaccepted. In response, Qabeel became enraged and threatened to kill Habeel, vowing that he would not allow him to marry his sister.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220428104808/https://dorar.net/h/808e9bbf2bff4252bd3830e50578ec2d"> Sahih (Albani)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, when Muhammad asserted his prophethood, the Jews asked him to provide proof through the manifestation of a miracle, specifically the fire consuming his offering.</p>
<p>Muhammad found himself unable to dismiss this demand outright, as he already acknowledged it in the story of Adam in the Quran.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad resorted to a different approach, offering a new excuse. He accepted the validity of the miracle involving the fire accepting the offering, but he refused to showcase this miracle. He justified his inability to show this miracle by accusing the Jews of Medina that their forefathers sinned by killing previous prophets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/3.183?context=3"> 3:183</a>:</p>
<p>They (the Jews) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in any messenger <strong>unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire</strong> (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: <strong>why then did ye slay them</strong>, if ye speak the truth?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this excuse by the writer of the Quran does not hold up under scrutiny for several reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is unjust to punish individuals for the sins of their ancestors. In this case, the writer of the Quran is essentially claiming to hold the Jews of his time accountable for the actions of their forefathers. This contradicts the concept of divine justice, which does not attribute guilt based on lineage.</p>
<p>Didn't the quran claim that no one is accountable for the action of others?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/6.164">6:164</a>:</p>
<p>Say, "Is it other than Allāh I should desire as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? <strong>And every soul earns not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the Jews of Muhammad's era maintained a strong belief in their own holy scriptures, which also indicated that the proof of prophethood involved successfully passing the miracle test. It is understandable that they would request the same evidence from Muhammad and, upon his failure to provide it, reject his claims. This rejection cannot be seen as their fault, as they were simply following the principles outlined in their own religious texts.</p>
<p>Ironically, when the Jewish holy books seemingly predicted the arrival of Muhammad (<a href="https://www.judaism-islam.com/muhammad-in-the-torah-bible/">according to Muslim claims</a>), Muhammad expected the Jews to adhere to their own scriptures. However, when those same holy books instructed them to seek the miracle of fire as a validation of prophethood, Muhammad wanted them to abandon that requirement. This double standard raises questions about consistency and fairness.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the writer of the Quran contradicts his own claims within the text. The Quran repeatedly asserts that the practices of Allah remain unchanging. Yet, in this instance, Muhammad is deviating from that principle by rejecting the miracle of fire as a valid proof of prophethood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/48.23"> 48:23</a>: [This is] the established way of Allah which has occurred before. <strong><em>And never will you find in the practice of Allah any change</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/35.43"> 35:43</a>: <strong style="font-size: 1rem;"> But you will never find in the practice of Allah any change, <em>and you will never find in the practice of Allah any alteration</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Muhammad was unable to perform the miracle of fire in front of the Jews, a sudden shift occurred in the ways of Allah to accommodate his inability to demonstrate miracles.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it is worth noting that compared to the ancestors of the Jews, the ancestors of the <strong>pagan Meccans (Mushrikeen)</strong> did not have a history of killing prophets. However, Muhammad didn't show any miracle to them too by making other excuses. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muhammad got so much exposure in this incident, that despite all his struggles to make the Jews of Medina happy in the beginning (by adopting many Biblical laws in Islamic Sharia), not even 10 Jews of Medina believed in him and converted to Islam;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3941">Sahih Bukhari, 3941</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Prophet said: <span class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">"Had only ten Jews believe me, all the Jews would definitely have believed me."</strong></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The 5th Quranic Excuse: The Miracle of the Sky Falling on the Meccans Did Not Occur due to Muhammad's Presence Among Them</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This incident happened later in Medina after Muhammad had also failed to show the miracle of fire to the Jews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/8.32?context=2">8:32</a>: </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And when they [Meccans] said, "O Allah, if this should be the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment."<strong> But Allah did not punish them while you, [O Muhammad], was among them</strong>, and Allah would not punish them while they sought forgiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse was revealed in Medina after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Badr">Battle of Badr</a> (in the 2nd Hijri Year), in which Muhammad got victory against the Meccan pagans. </p>
<p>Is it not strange and ridiculous that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AFTER MANY MANY YEARS</strong></span>, Allah remembered to tell the <strong>reason </strong>why He didn't let the sky fall on Meccan pagans? During the 13 years of the Meccan life of Muhammad, the pagans were constantly demanding and challenging Muhammad/Allah to fulfil their promise, but Allah uttered not a single word. </p>
<p>Two more pertinent questions arise from this narrative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, why did Allah not choose to punish the Meccans with the miracle of the falling sky during Muhammad's absence or just after his migration to Medina? Due to no divine punishment, the Meccan pagans succeeded in waging wars against Muhammad, even killing many Muslims and even breaking the teeth of Muhammad in the Battle of Uhud. But despite breaking the teeth of Muhammad, and despite Muhammad's absence among them, still no sky fell on them. </li>
<li>Secondly, the Meccans did not solely request the miracle of punishment; rather, they sought any miraculous manifestation (even without any punishment), similar to those experienced by the previous prophets, that could substantiate Muhammad's claim to prophethood. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Please see the following verse again where they are also asking Muhammad for any miracle (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>even without punishment</strong></span>), and they were ready to believe in his prophethood. </span></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3">17:90-93</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, "We will not believe you until <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(1)</strong></span> you break open for us from the ground a spring. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(2)</strong></span> Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] Or you make the SKY FALL UPON US IN FRAGMENTS AS YOU HAVE CLAIMED <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(3)</strong></span> or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(4)</strong></span> Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(5)</strong></span> or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read."  Say: "Glory to my Lord. (I cannot do it while) I am only man and a messenger." </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, Muhammad along with his Allah failed to show even any simple miracle without any punishment, as it happened in the cases of previous prophets. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2>Double Standards: Muhammad <em>always denied</em> showing any miracle of his prophethood, but<em> demanded</em> others to show miracles of their prophethood</h2>
<p>You have seen above how Muhammad always denied showing any miracle of his prophethood. But now let us see the following tradition:  </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3055">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3055</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Ibn 'Umar: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Umar and a group of the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) set out with the Prophet to Ibn Saiyad. He found him playing with some boys near the hillocks of Bani Maghala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty. He did not notice (the Prophet's presence) till the Prophet (ﷺ) stroked him on the back with his hand and said, "Ibn Saiyad! Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, "<em>I testify that you are the Apostle of the illiterates</em>." </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet. "<em>Do you testify that I am the apostle of Allah</em>?" The Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, "I believe in Allah and His Apostles." Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to Ibn Saiyad). "What do you see?" Ibn Saiyad replied, "True people and false ones visit me." The Prophet said, "Your mind is confused as to this matter."<em><strong> The Prophet (ﷺ) added, " I have kept something (in my mind) for you." Ibn Saiyad said, "It is Ad-Dukh." The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Shame be on you! You cannot cross your limits.</strong></em>" On that 'Umar said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allow me to chop his head off." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "If he should be him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) then you cannot overpower him, and should he not be him, then you are not going to benefit by murdering him."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad never showed a miracle to others as proof of his prophethood and made several excuses. </li>
<li>But when Ibn Siyad failed to show a miracle on the SPOT, Muhammad IMMEDIATELY blamed him for being a false prophet.  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In simple words, these are Double Standards. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Islamic preacher: Prophet Muhammad showed many other miracles</h2>
<p>And Islamic preacher wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is false to say the Prophet of Allah (PBUH) didn't perform any miracle. He performed many miracles which are found in Ahadith.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">All these are FABRICATED Ahadith, and the Quran is itself a witness to this that Allah had already stopped sending any more miracles/signs:</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>No, this is only a false claim by Islamic apologists. No such Quranic verse is present which confirms any moon splitting miracle in front of pagans. These are only fabricated Ahadith by Muslims which claim the existence of such moon splitting miracle. Please read our article:</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The core question of "Why Test?" bears similarities to the broader inquiry of "Why Creation?" This topic has proven challenging for Islamic scholars and apologists to explain, as it calls into question the<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> underlying motivation behind Allah's choice to TEST His creation</strong></span>.</p>
<p>When this question is posed, Islamic apologists often respond with a familiar refrain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mankind was created to pass the TEST."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this response doesn't address the core question: <span style="color: #1000ff;"><strong>Why did Allah decide to TEST mankind</strong></span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a decision that necessitated their CREATION in the first place</strong></span>?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the notion of a "test" primarily relates to tasks that humanity must undertake <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AFTER</strong></span> they have already been created. Consequently, <strong><span style="color: #1200ff;">the concept of a test doesn't inherently provide a reason or justification for the initial act of CREATION itself</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Islamists have to openly accept that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allah neither told the underlying reason/motivation for the TEST</li>
<li>Nor did Allah tell the reason for not telling it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why a Test of PRAISING Allah? </h2>
<p>One could have understood i<span>f </span><span>a Test consisted of helping Humanity and doing good deeds and avoiding evils.</span></p>
<p>But why a Test of worshipping and praising Allah 5 times a day?</p>
<p>And this "Worship and Praise Syndrome" extends beyond humans:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider angels—they've been engaged in worshipping and praising Allah for nearly eternity, despite gaining no benefit from it, nor are they destined for paradise. Why does Allah demand their constant worship and praise? Yes, Islamists come up with the same lame excuse that Allah does not need worship and praise from angels, but it is the same as if Allah says: "I am eating food, although I don't need food", or if Allah says: "I am sleeping, although I don't need sleep."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But it doesn't stop with angels. According to Islam, all creatures, from animals and insects to celestial bodies like the moon, sun, and stars, as well as mountains and each and every particle in the universe is worshipping and praising Allah incessantly. <span>Yet, this devotion will not benefit them, as none of these entities will enter paradise and have 72 houris.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn't Allah's insistence on being worshipped and praised 24 hours suggest<span> </span><strong>narcissism</strong>, indicating a self-centered motive for creating humankind and the universe to praise him?</p>
<p>Man has created Allah, which is why all human weaknesses are also found in Allah.</p>
<p>What does Allah gain from the constant praises of angels, animals, birds, and even every particle in the universe? Islamic apologists might say that Allah does not need all this praise ... But then it's again like Allah constantly eating food and also at the same time saying that does not need to eat. </p>

<h2>Allah's Test: The <span style="color: #0300ff;">Greatest</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">INJUSTICE </span>against<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <span style="color: #2100ff;">Mankind</span></span></h2>
<p>There exists no Allah. But if true, then Allah's Test is the greatest injustice against mankind. </p>
<p>We are born as humans only, and it is our parents who indoctrinate us into different religions. This is why 99.9999% of children raised in Christian families adopt Christianity.</p>
<p>Even in this modern era of communication, the conversion rate to Islam is not even 0.0001%. This implies that 99.9999% of people born into non-Muslim families by Allah's design are destined for eternal hellfire, regardless of their good deeds and humanity throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Is this truly Divine Justice?</p>
<p>Our sense of humanity clearly tells us that this is the Greatest <strong>DHULM (injustice)</strong> ever against mankind. There is no greater injustice in the universe than billions of innocent people being condemned to eternal hellfire simply because they were born into non-Muslim families by Allah's design.</p>
<p>Alone this injustice is <strong>ENOUGH</strong> to leave the religion, as it goes against humanity.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Islamic god (i.e. Allah), has never appeared directly before us nor has He shown any miracles as proof of His existence. We are still demanded to feel Him indirectly. However, when we analyse these indirect issues to determine if Allah exists, we perceive the greatest injustice in this expectation. How can we ever accept such an unjust entity as God?</span></p>
<h3>Islamist's Excuse: The TEST is justified while Everyone has HEARD about Islam and thus have a Chance to Accept it</h3>
<p>An Islamist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah is not unjust. Even though 6 billion people are born into non-Muslim families, Islam is prevalent worldwide. They have <strong>heard</strong> about it and have every opportunity to accept Islam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p>We absolutely don't agree with it.</p>
<p>If 99.9999% of people are unable to accept Islam after taking birth in non-Muslim families, <strong>then there is a REASON for it</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to accept Islam, it is not enough to just <strong>HEAR</strong> about its existence, but one has to do a <strong>Long Research</strong> to become <strong>convinced</strong> it to be the only true religion.</p>
<p>How strange, Islamic preachers tell ex-Muslims that they need to be an EXPERT in Islam before leaving it. But they don't put the same condition of being an expert and having a PhD degree before entering Islam. Are these not DOUBLE STANDARDS?</p>
<p>For example, Muhammad claimed that her mother was in hellfire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:976b">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 976b</a>:</p>
<p>The Apostle of Allah visited the grave of his mother and he wept, and moved others around him to tears, and said: I sought permission from my Lord to beg forgiveness for her but it was not granted to me (while she failed in accepting the religion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif">Hanif</a>, and died as non-Mulsim).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the question remains: what chance did a woman have in that era of ignorance to accept the religion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif">Hanif</a>?</p>
<p>In Islam, the followers of the religion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif">Hanif</a> were those who, during the pre-Islamic period of Jahiliyyah, renounced idolatry, Christianity, and Judaism. They followed monotheism and the religion of Abraham, which emphasized submission to God in its purest form.</p>

<div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-1 juice:empty:hidden juice:first:pt-[3px]">
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">
<p>There were barely four followers of the religion of Hanif in Mecca. Two of them later abandoned Hanifism and became apostates. She likely never encountered any of them directly.</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible for someone to convert to another religion merely by hearing about it. Several factors contribute to this difficulty, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indoctrination from childhood into the family's religion, making rebellion almost unthinkable.</li>
<li>Immense pressure from family, tribe, and society against leaving the religion of one's ancestors, particularly challenging for women.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such circumstances, where a woman is under the pressure of her family and tribe, living in the era of ignorance, perhaps herself ignorant, where instead of contemplating religions like a philosopher, the struggle for physical survival is ongoing, how can a woman in such a situation accept the true religion?</p>
<p>Did Muhammad's mother truly have an equal chance of becoming a Muslim compared to those born into Muslim families by Allah's design?</p>
<p>If you acknowledge that she didn't have equal chances, it implies an admission that Allah indeed committed an injustice against the 99.9999% of non-Muslims who were not born into Muslim families by His design.</p>

<p>Another Islamist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah says in the Quran: "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and night there are signs for people of reason" (Quran 3:190). Thus, Allah is not unjust (ZALIM), and all people who are born into non-Muslim families have a full opportunity to accept Islam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that the claim of divine creation is not unique to Islam; virtually all religions assert that their god or gods are responsible for creating the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>For an average person, determining which religious claim about creation is true, is almost impossible. Each religion's scriptures make similar assertions about their deities being the true creators, leaving a layperson with no clear way to discern which is correct. One has to do a lot of research work on all religions to determine which religious god actually created the universe. </p>
<p>Moreover, the argument about the creation of the heavens and the earth pertains solely to the question of whether a god exists or not. It does not cover the answer which specific god of which specific religion created the universe. This argument does not provide definitive proof of the existence of any particular "religious god", including Allah. Furthermore, modern science offers alternative theories about the creation of the universe that challenge these religious claims.</p>
<p>Empirical data does not lie. It proves the notion that this creation of the universe argument fails to convince the vast majority of people born into non-Muslim families. Despite the universal presence of this argument in religious texts, 99.9999% of individuals born into non-Muslim families do not convert to Islam based on this reasoning. According to Islamic belief, this means they are destined for eternal hellfire, which raises questions about the fairness of such a system.</p>

<h2>What will happen to the children born into non-Muslim families who die at a young age without accepting Islam?</h2>
<p>Is there any Muslim with the courage to answer this question: What will happen to the children born into non-Muslim families who die at a young age without accepting Islam? According to Islam, a girl becomes an adult at the age of 9 and a boy at the age of 12. If they die at a young age without accepting Islam, then your Allah will make them the fuel of eternal hellfire. </p>
<p>Is this a Divine Justice in any sense? </p>

<div>
<h2>The Background Story: Why did Muhammad start claiming that all non-Muslims are fuel of hellfire?</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In reality, the underlying motivation for this doctrine was political. Muhammad's companions hesitated to engage in wars with their own Meccan relatives, causing frustration for Muhammad. Thus, Muhammad began proclaiming that disbelief in his prophethood would result in eternal damnation, regardless of one's good deeds, as a means to coerce compliance.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In the early days in Medina, Muhammad attempted to gain favor with the Jews by asserting that all Jews and Christians who do good deeds would go to paradise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/2.62?context=5">2:62:</a></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Rest assured that whosoever from among the Muslims or the Jews or the Christians or the Sabaeans believes in Allah and the Last Day, and performs good deeds,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> he will have his reward with his Lord and he will have no cause for fear and grief</strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>]</strong></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, as conflicts with the Meccans arose (who were relatives of the migrant Muslims and they showed hesitance to fight against their own relatives), Muhammad changed the message of verse <a href="https://quranx.com/2.62?context=5">2:62</a>. To motivate his followers to fight against their own relatives, he now claimed that despite their good deeds, those relatives would end up in eternal hellfire for not accepting his prophethood. This shift was intended to diminish any love they felt for their relatives and fill them with the necessary animosity to fight against them.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Then Muhammad started telling his companions that his mother, father, uncle Abu Talib and his grandfather Abdul Muttalib are also in hellfire (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/447616/%E2%80%98abdul-muttalib-and-abu-talib-are-in-hellfire">source</a>), so that his companions started feeling hatred against their own non-Muslim relatives, and didn't feel hesitation to fight against them. </p>
<h2>Muhammad's Claim: The TEST is justified while all humans testified Allah is their lord BEFORE their Birth</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Many people were not happy with Muhammad, when he claimed that their parents were fuel of eternal hellfire, while they died without recognising Allah as their lord. But people were unable to understand how their parents could have recognised Allah (or the religion of HANIF) when there were hardly any opportunities available hear the message of Hanif. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anyhow, Muhammad made the following CLAIM to justify the TEST.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/7.172?context=10">7:172</a>:</p>
<p>And when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], "Am I not your Lord?" They said, "Yes, we have testified." [This] - <strong>lest you should say on the <span style="color: #2100ff;">day of Resurrection</span>, "<span style="color: #ff0034;">Indeed, we were of this unaware</span>."</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, it is not an argument, but only a claim by Muhammad. No one is able to verify it if any Allah exists, and who took them out from their loins (before their birth) and let them testify that Allah is their lord. </p>
<p>Secondly, this verse claims that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allah took the promise (to accept him as Lord and to worship him alone) from all humans <strong><span style="color: #ff0034;">BEFOFRE</span> their birth</strong>. </li>
<li>Then they were made to <span style="color: #2100ff;"><strong>FORGET</strong></span> this promise when they were sent <strong>into this world</strong>. </li>
<li>And then they will be reminded of this promise again, <strong>only <span style="color: #ff0034;">AFTER</span> their death (on the day of Ressurection)</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the question is, whatever happened before the birth, or whatever will happen after the death, <strong>why Allah is taking a TEST on its basis in this world</strong>?</p>
<p>It would only become a test if Allah had appeared in this life to all humans, and then He would have put humans to a test, whereby <strong>intentional disobedience</strong> would result in eternal fire.</p>
<p>For example, according to the Islamic story, Allah appeared to Iblees (i.e., Lucifer/Satan), and Iblees was not caused to <span style="color: #2100ff;"><strong>FORGET</strong></span> Allah, but still he intentionally disobeyed Him. In such a case, one can understand why Iblees will be put in hell.</p>
<p>But the case of humans is totally different from that of Iblees, and it has absolutely no justification:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are thousands of people who are born into non-Muslim families. Allah never appeared to them openly as He did to Iblees. Thus, under the influence of their families, 99.9999% of these people never accepted Allah and remained non-Muslims.</li>
<li>Millions of non-Muslims truthfully try to find out the real God, but Islam has so many problematic, controversial, and anti-humanity teachings that they had to reject Islam due to their <strong>true intentions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to mention, there are millions of ex-Muslims who were firmly believing and practicing Muslims. But they also felt the pain of humanity. When they tried to find God with sincere hearts, their search led them to the conclusion that there is no Allah in the heavens, and Muhammad was making revelations on his own. Thus, they left Islam and Allah.</p>
<p>Islam claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>إنما الأعمال <strong>بالنيات</strong></p>
<p>(Verily, the reward of deeds depends on the <strong>intentions</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here we see a clear contradiction. Instead of being judged based on their true intentions, they are called an apostate. Islam demands that they be killed in this life, and then Allah condemns them to eternal hellfire, disregarding all the good deeds they did for mankind. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Islamist's objection:</span></strong></p>
<p>An Islamic preacher wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone says that they do not know or do not remember acknowledging Allah as their Lord as mentioned in Surah Al-A'raf, Ayah 172, this argument is not acceptable. Allah has taken all of us out of our mothers' wombs, and we do not remember what we did or saw in the womb. An atheist does not have an answer for this either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Response</span>: </p>
<p>We do not remember being in the mother's womb today, but our mother remembers, and others have seen us in the womb. There are countless witnesses.</p>
<p>However, in the story where Allah took a covenant from all humans after extracting them from Adam's loins, is there even a single witness to this? Allah is unseen, the angels are unseen, and the revelation is unseen. Consequently, anyone could make such claims about their religious stories where all witnesses are 'unseen'.</p>
<h2>Muhammad's Claim: The Test is justified while mankind itself chose it for themselves</h2>
<p>Muhammad also tried to justify the TEST by bringing the following claim:</p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.72">33:72</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>إِنَّا عَرَضْنَا ٱلْأَمَانَةَ عَلَى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلْجِبَالِ فَأَبَيْنَ أَن يَحْمِلْنَهَا وَأَشْفَقْنَ مِنْهَا وَحَمَلَهَا ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ ۖ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ <strong>ظَلُومًا جَهُولًا</strong></p>
<p>We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to carry it and were afraid of doing so; but man carried it. Surely he is a <strong>tyrant</strong> and <strong>ignorant</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Muhammad's attempt to justify why humans were subjected to the test, a significant issue arises. This argument actually places the blame on Allah Himself rather than on humans. The questions that emerge include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did humans agree to bear this trust?</li>
<li>According to this verse, it is Allah who created humans as <strong>tyrants</strong> and <strong>ignorant</strong> beings, and it was the sole reason that they accepted the test.</li>
<li>Therefore, if it was Allah who created humans as tyrants and ignorant beings, then the true <strong>culprit</strong> is Allah Himself. Humans cannot be held responsible for this, and they should not be unjustly punished.</li>
<li>Moreover, although Allah (i.e. Muhammad) claimed in this verse that the <strong>heavens/earth/mountains</strong> were also presented with the test, but this statement makes no sense as <strong>heavens/earth/mountains have absolutely no FREE Will and they can neither succeed nor fail nor refuse nor become afraid of doing it as they would never fall in the hell or paradise. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This highlights the <strong>complete failure</strong> of Muhammad to present a <strong>single logical argument</strong> for putting humans to the test, especially considering that the majority of them will end up in hell by Allah's Design and suffer eternal torment. How does making humans <strong>ظَلُومًا جَهُولًا tyrant and ignorant</strong> save Allah from injustice of putting majority of humankind in eternal hellfire according to his Design?</p>
<p>And the jinns are not even the “Best of Creations اشرفُ المخلوقات”, and their majority too will still land in the hellfire for eternity. </p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/7.179">7.179</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلْإِنسِ</p>
<p>And indeed We have created majority of jinns and men for hell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor jinns. But the good thing is that they don't exist except in the minds of religiously brainwashed people. </p>]]></description>

<h2>Details:</h2>
<p>In the 2nd part of this series of "The Test", we saw how Muhammad (and his Allah) FAILED constantly to show even a single tinniest miracle in front of the pagan Meccans, despite repetitive demand from them. Please read this 2nd part here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/why-test/48-allah-failed-to-pass-his-own-test-of-showing-a-miracle">Allah's FAILURE to pass his own <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>TEST</strong></span> of showing any <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>MIRACLE</strong></span> to the Pagans</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The pagan Meccans, in an attempt to test Muhammad's claims further, sought assistance from the Jews. The Jews sent them three challenging questions, which should serve as a Test i.e. if Muhammad could answer those questions through revelation from Allah. </p>
<p>When the Meccans presented these questions to Muhammad, he struggled to provide answers for a period of 15 days (as he was gathering information from people, instead of getting any information through revelation). He then attributed this delay to the absence of Gabriel, claiming that the presence of a puppy in his home prevented the angelic visitation.</p>
<p>Imam Syuti documented the following tradition in his commentary concerning this verse<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;tAyahNo=23&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">18:23 (link)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أخرج ابن المنذرعن مجاهد، أن قريشاً اجتمعت فقالوا: " يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، فما هذا الدين الذي جئت به؟ قال: هذا دين جئت به من الرحمن. فقالوا: إنا لا نعرف الرحمن، إلا رحمن اليمامة - يعنون مسيلمة الكذاب - ثم كاتبوا اليهود فقالوا: قد نبغ فينا رجل يزعم أنه نبي، وقد رغب عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، ويزعم أن الذي جاء به من الرحمن. قلنا: لا نعرف الرحمن إلا رحمن اليمامة، وهو أمين لا يخون.. وفيّ لا يغدر.. صدوق لا يكذب، وهو في حسب وثروة من قومه، فاكتبوا إلينا بأشياء نسأله عنها. فاجتمعت يهود فقالوا: إن هذا لوصفه وزمانه الذي يخرج فيه. فكتبوا إلى قريش: أن سلوه عن أمر أصحاب الكهف، وعن ذي القرنين، وعن الروح. فإن يكن الذي أتاكم به من الرحمن، فإن الرحمن هو الله عز وجل، وإن يكن من رحمن اليمامة فينقطع. فلما أتى ذلك قريشاً أتى الظفر في أنفسها فقالوا: يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائك... فحدثنا عن أمر أصحاب الكهف وذي القرنين والروح. قال: ائتوني غداً. ولم يستثن، فمكث جبريل عنه ما شاء الله لا يأتيه، ثم أتاه فقال: سألوني عن أشياء لم يكن عندي بها علم فأجيب حتى شق ذلك عليّ. قال: ألم ترنا لا ندخل بيتاً فيه كلب ولا صورة؟ - وكان في البيت جرو كلب - ونزلت { ولا تقولن لشيء إني فاعل ذلك غداً إلا أن يشاء الله واذكر ربك إذا نسيت وقل عسى أن يهدين ربي لأقرب من هذا رشداً } من علم الذي سألتموني عنه أن يأتي قبل غد؟ ونزل ما ذكر من أصحاب الكهف ونزل{ ويسألونك عن الروح... } [الإسراء: 85] الآية ".</p>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic">... Quraysh (the pagan tribe of Muhammad) wrote to Jews that there had appeared a person among them, who claims himself to be a prophet, and he had left the religion of their ancestors ... Jews replied: "Asked him 3 questions about the Ashab-e-Kuhf (The people of Cave), Dhulqarnain ("the Two-Horned One") and Ruh (i.e. the Spirit) ... Quraysh became happy upon it and they said to Muhammad: "If you have already left the religion of our ancestors, then tell us about Ashab-e-Kuhf (The people of Cave), Dhulqarnain, and the spirit."  Muhammad said to them: "Come to me tomorrow (and I will reply)." But Muhammad forgot to say Insha-Allah (i.e. if Allah wills). <strong>Gabriel came to him after only 15 days.</strong> Muhammad said to Gabriel: "Quraysh came to me and they asked me about somethings (as a test of my prophethood), which I didn't know. Thus, I was in a very difficult state during this period." Gabriel replied: <em><strong>"Have you not seen we (i.e. angels) don't enter a house which has a dog or a picture? And there was a puppy in your house (who entered the house and Muhammad didn't know about it).</strong></em>" Upon that this verse was revealed: [... <em><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>and do not enquire about those questions from any one of them<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"> (i.e. Muhammad was collecting information about those 3 questions from people during those 15 days)</span></strong></span>.</em> <em><strong>And never say of anything, "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow," Except (when adding), "If Allah wills</strong>." </em>Quran 18:22-24] </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual situation was as under:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muhammad neither knew the answers to the three questions nor was he in contact with any Allah or angel.</li>
<li>Consequently, Muhammad began <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>enquiring about those questions from others (<span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);">and the Quran (verse <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/18/22/default.htm">18:22</a>) is itself a witness of this action of Muhammad</span>)</strong></span>. It took him 15 days to gather some information about those 3 questions. </li>
<li>Later Muhammad made an excuse that he was unable to answer the questions the next day, as he had forgotten to say Insha-Allah (if God wills). And he claimed that a puppy entering his house prevented Gabriel from delivering the answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, those answers from Muhammad (which consisted of alleged divine revelation), were not only "incomplete", but Muhammad (and his Allah) were not even able to understand the original Jewish questions. </p>
<h2>Background of the 3 Jewish Questions:</h2>
<p>(The following information is provided by Adam ElMasri in his video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSFwSvX1RoU">Link</a>), along with some additions made by us)</p>
<h3>The First Question:</h3>
<p>For a long period before Islam began, both Christians and Jews tried to classify and canonize the books of the Bible. A few decades prior to Islam, an interesting dispute arose between Christians and Jews, precisely around the prophetic books. The Jewish Bible is divided into three sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>Torah (the first 5 books that consist of the law),</li>
<li>Ketovim (which means the writings),</li>
<li>and Navieem (which means the prophets).</li>
</ol>
<p>When it came to classifying and canonizing <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16484">The Book of Denial</a>, a big argument occurred between some Jewish rabbis and other Jewish sects and Christians about whether the book of Daniel should be included in the Navieem (writing) section or in the Ketovim (prophets) section.</p>
<p>In fact, the core argument was about whether Daniel is a prophet or not!</p>
<p>Jews then canonized the book of Daniel in the Ketovim (writings ... i.e. Daniel (Arabic: <a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84"><span dir="rtl">دانيال</span></a>) was not a prophet), while Christians placed the book of Daniel in the prophets (Navieem). The debate continued for decades.</p>
<p>Daniel himself claimed that he had seen a <strong>vision</strong>. But in Rabbinic sources, there is a clear distinction between a <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);">prophetic vision</span></strong> and a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>prophecy</strong></span> through <span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);"><strong>the spirit of God</strong></span>, which is called in Hebrew <strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);">Ruach ha Kodesh</span></strong>, in Arabic Al Rouh el Kodos <span class="mw-page-title-main"><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3">الروح القدس</a> </span>or the Holy Spirit, sometimes referred to simply as The Spirit – Ha Ruach – Al Rouh الروح. This is the spirit that the Jews asked Muhammad about, and he had no clue what they were talking about.</p>
<p>The prophethood of Daniel was a hot debate topic, whether he was a prophet or not, until just a few decades before Muhammad. Therefore, the Jews believed that if Muhammad was truly a prophet of God, he would be able to resolve this dispute. Thus, they asked Muhammad this question. However, Muhammad disappeared for 15 days trying to find clues with no luck. So he came back with this answer: (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/17.85">17:85</a>):"They ask you about the Spirit. Say: '<em>The Spirit is by command of my Lord, and you have not been given of knowledge except a little.</em>'"</p>
<p>In essence, Muhammad evaded answering the this question completely by using the excuse that only limited knowledge about the spirit is granted to humans.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1735365/jewish/Why-Isnt-the-Book-of-Daniel-Part-of-the-Prophets.htm">Why Isn’t the Book of Daniel Part of the Prophets?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The 2nd Question:</h2>
<p>There existed two famous (but very much similar) stories at that time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one was in the Book of Daniel (in the Bible) involving 3 young Jewish men.  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%203%3A8-30&amp;version=NIV"><strong>Daniel 3:8-30 (NIV)</strong></a> . And the Jews beleived in it. </li>
<li>The second story was about "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seven-Sleepers-of-Ephesus">The Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus</a> (i.e. The people of the Cave)", which involved 7 Christian people (with some versions mentioning 8 people. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seven-Sleepers-of-Ephesus">Link</a>). It was not even a part of the Bible. and the Jews didn't even believe in it (but opposed it, as it was telling about 3 faithful Christians, who were enemies of the Jews).  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Jews asked Muhammad about the first strory from the Book of Daniel (in the Bible). But Muhammad and his Allah got confused, and thought it was about the 2nd story of the Christian legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus (i.e. The people of the Cave).</p>
<p>The resemblance between the story of the three young men in the Book of Daniel and the legend of the seven sleepers lies primarily in their themes of faith, divine protection, and miraculous preservation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Faith and Divine Protection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three Young Jewish Men in the Book of Daniel</strong>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown into a fiery furnace for refusing to worship a golden statue set up by King Nebuchadnezzar. Their unwavering faith in God led to their miraculous preservation. An angel protected them, and they emerged from the furnace unharmed, demonstrating God's power and their faith.</li>
<li><strong>Legend of the Seven (or Eight) Sleepers</strong>: This Christian legend (which was not a part of the Bible) tells of seven or eight young Christian men who hid in a cave to escape persecution for their faith. They fell asleep and miraculously awoke centuries later, unharmed and unchanged, during a time when Christianity was no longer persecuted. Their story is seen as a testament to divine protection and the enduring nature of faith.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Miraculous Preservation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three Young Men</strong>: The miracle here is their survival in the fiery furnace without any harm, symbolizing God's direct intervention and protection.</li>
<li><strong>Seven (or Eight) Sleepers</strong>: The miracle is their prolonged sleep and preservation over centuries, which serves as a sign of God's care and the passage of time without physical change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to resemblance in these two stories, the people (whom Muhammad enquired for information) got confused, which made Muhammad ultra confused as a result. Thus, Muhammad mixed the both stories and clamed their numbers exactly from 3 to eight in the Quran.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=18&amp;verse=22">18:22:</a></p>
<p><span>سَیَقُولُونَ ثَلَـٰثَةࣱ رَّابِعُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡ وَیَقُولُونَ خَمۡسَةࣱ سَادِسُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡ رَجۡمَۢا بِٱلۡغَیۡبِۖ وَیَقُولُونَ سَبۡعَةࣱ وَثَامِنُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡۚ قُل رَّبِّیۤ أَعۡلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِم مَّا یَعۡلَمُهُمۡ إِلَّا قَلِیلࣱۗ فَلَا تُمَارِ فِیهِمۡ إِلَّا مِرَاۤءࣰ ظَـٰهِرࣰا وَلَا <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>تَسۡتَفۡتِ</strong></span> فِیهِم مِّنۡهُمۡ أَحَدࣰا</span></p>
<p><span>They will say there were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>three</strong></span>, the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">fourth</span></strong> of them being their dog; and they will say there were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>five</strong></span>, the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">sixth</span></strong> of them being their dog - guessing at the unseen; and they will say there were <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>seven</strong></span>, and the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">eighth</span></strong> of them was their dog. Say, [O Muhammad], "My Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows them except a few. So do not argue about them except with an obvious argument <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>and do not <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">inquire <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">(arabic:  تَسۡتَفۡتِ)</span></span> about them from anyone among them.</strong></span>" (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=18&amp;verse=22">Translated by Corpus Quran</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, the question is, why was Muhammad <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>ENQUIRING</strong></span> others about these questions? This alone is enough to understand that the answers were not delivered to him by any angel, but rather, he gathered information by <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>Enquiring</strong></span> from people during those 15 days. People were not fools, and they were able to see Muhammad asking people about those information. They started making fun of his Allah. Thus, Muhammad wanted to deflect the blame from his Allah and thus showed if he was enquiring about them from people on his own, while his Allah later stopped him from doing it.</p>
<p>Muhammad claimed that his Allah was 100% perfect and all-knowing. Therefore, it was crucial for Muhammad to keep his Allah free from any accusations of ignorance or shortcomings. To achieve this, Muhammad often employed the tactic of taking the blame upon himself to deflect any criticism from his Allah. An example of this can be seen in the incident of the <a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/85-satanic-verses-the-original-incident-exposing-muhammad-revelation">Satanic Verses (Quran 17:73-75)</a>, where he assumed full responsibility for the Satanic Verses, thereby absolving his Allah of any fault.</p>
<p>Secondly, on one hand, Muhammad asserted that Allah possessed precise knowledge of the number of people in the cave, but on the other hand, Allah did not disclose the exact figures. The question arises: Why? One wonders, <strong><span style="color: rgb(230, 126, 35);">what potential harm would have arisen if Allah had revealed the precise numbers of the people in the cave</span></strong>? </p>
<p>Thirdly, Please also note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original story in the Book of Daniel involved 3 young men.</li>
<li>The Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus involved 7 people (with some versions mentioning 8), who were sleeping in the cave.</li>
<li>Thus, Muhammad mixed both of these stories and came to the figures of 3 to 8 in the Quran. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fourthly, this legend was not even a part of the Bible, but only a later made legend by Christians. And Jews could not have asked about this Christian legend, as it is about PIOUS and Faithful Christian men, which went against Jewish beliefs. </p>
<h3>The 3rd Question:</h3>
<p>Then the Jews asked about the story of the ram with 2 horns in the Book of Daniel. However, Muhammad got confused and thought that the Jews were asking about Alexander the Great (who was also historically known as "the Two-Horned One"). </p>
<p>Jews then asked Muhammad and his Allah about a story from the Book of Daniel (Bible), which was a dream involving a ram with two horns.</p>
<p>Firstly, the verse 3 to 4 are telling about the VISION about the ram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 8:3-4: <br></strong>I looked up (in the vision), and there before me was a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 54);"><strong>ram with two horns</strong></span>, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. I watched the ram as it charged toward <span style="color: rgb(0, 33, 255);"><strong>the west and the north and the south</strong></span>. <strong>No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power</strong>. It did as it pleased and became <strong>great</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the verse 20 gave the interpretation of the VISION:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 8:20: <br></strong><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 9);">The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia</span> </strong>...<span id="en-NIV-21985" class="text Dan-8-23">“In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise.</span> <span id="en-NIV-21986" class="text Dan-8-24">He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people.</span> <span id="en-NIV-21987" class="text Dan-8-25">He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Muhammad falsely thought that the Jews were asking the question about the story of Alexander the Great, who was also historically known as "the Two-Horned One."  In Hellenistic culture, Alexander the Great was depicted with horns, symbolizing divinity and power. For example, coins from the era of Alexander depict him with ram's horns, which were associated with the Egyptian god Amun. Alexander was declared the son of Amun in the Siwa Oasis, and this imagery was used to represent his divine status and authority.</p>
<p>The Quranic Arabic word "Dhulqarnain" itself literally means "<strong>the two-horned one.</strong>"</p>
<p>And then Muhammad gave the following answer about this story, in which Dhulqarnain goes to the West and no one could stand against him. Later he went to the East, and again no one could stand against him. Then he went to the North, and again no one could stand against him. </p>
<p>The story of Dhul-Qarnain is found in Surah Al-Kahf (Chapter 18) of the Quran, verses 83-101. Dhul-Qarnain is presented as a righteous and powerful ruler who embarks on three major expeditions across the world, guided by divine wisdom and justice. Here is a summary of his story and expeditions:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Expedition: The Western Expedition</strong></span></p>
<p>Dhul-Qarnain's first journey takes him to the far west, where he reaches the setting place of the sun, described as a "murky spring." There, he finds a people living in that region. God gives him the choice to either punish them or treat them with kindness. Dhul-Qarnain chooses justice, rewarding those who do good and punishing wrongdoers. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Second Expedition: The Eastern Expedition</strong></span></p>
<p>His second journey takes him to the far east, where he finds a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third Expedition: The Northern Expedition and the Barrier</strong></span></p>
<p>In his final and most famous expedition, Dhul-Qarnain travels to a region between two mountains. There, he encounters a people who seek his help against the tribes of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj), who are causing great corruption and havoc. Dhul-Qarnain agrees to help them and constructs a massive barrier of iron and molten copper between the mountains, effectively containing Gog and Magog. He declares that this barrier will hold until the Day of Judgment when God will cause it to collapse.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad failed to provide a clear answer regarding the true identity of Dhulqarnain, leading to ongoing confusion among Muslims. The vague response given by the Quran and Muhammad perpetuated an endless cycle of uncertainty. This confusion is exemplified by various contradictory statements.</p>
<p>Firstly, Muslim apologists claimed that it was <strong>Alexander the Great</strong> who was Dhulqarnain. But then the problem occurred that historical and archaeological evidence reveals that Alexander the Great was a polytheist who believed he was the literal son of Greek and Egyptian gods. Moreover, the version of the Quran includes Alexander building a huge iron wall (Gates of Alexander) to trap the people of Gog and Magog behind, which will be broken at the end of times. However there's no evidence this wall exists at all, and Muslims suddenly started claiming 'it's somewhere underground' once Google Maps became a thing.</p>
<p>Thus, Islamic apologists tried to shift the identity of Dhul Qarnayn from Alexander to other prominent historical kings, such as <strong>Cyrus the Great</strong>. However, that shift holds very little evidence and has major flaws compared to the overwhelming evidence that the story is actually based on the Syriac legend of Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's not going to be Cyrus either, because, like Alexander, he also prayed to and tolerated pagan deities and religions, not very Islamic.</p>
<p>Muslims have to suffer for centuries due to all these contradictions, while Muhammad (and his Allah) were not able to tell clearly about the story of ram with two horns. </p>
<h2>Islamist apologist: How can you be sure that the Jews asked questions from the Book of Daniel?</h2>
<p>An apologist wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But how do you know that they were asking about the book of Daniel? It seems you just put your own interpretation of the questions and blame Muhammad for not using the same interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Just use common sense, and everyone can easily see the Truth. </p>
<p>Muslims did not preserve any Jewish or Pagan writings or oral narratives for future generations, which could have provided their version of the story. Thus, we are left only with the Quran and Muslim traditions. However, as humans, we have <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">COMMON SENSE</span></strong> and can still deduce conclusions from surrounding evidences.</p>
<p>Please consider these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why would the Jews ask about a Christian legend instead of the original Bible? How could they ask about something that contradicted their beliefs, as they did not consider Christians to be faithful and righteous people?</li>
<li>And why did Muhammad/Allah became confused about the exact numbers of person? How did Muhammad (and his Allah) mentioned EXACTLY the figures of 3 to 8? </li>
<li value="3">And what harm had it caused, if Allah would have told the exact numbers?</li>
<li>What purpose would it serve for the Jews to ask about the <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>INFIDEL</strong></span> Alexander the Great and his achievements?</li>
<li>What interest would there be for the Jews in asking about the "Human Spirit"? But surely, they had a great interestest in SOLVING the great DISPUTE, if the vision shown by the "<strong>Spirit of God</strong> <a class="relative pointer-events-auto a

<p>Moreover, consider this: <strong>How many pagans or Jews converted to Islam due to Muhammad's answers to these questions?</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps none.</p>
<p>If Muhammad had miraculously provided correct answers to these three questions through revelation, <strong>it would be logical to expect a significant number of pagans and Jews to convert to Islam due to this miracle</strong>. <strong>However,<em><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"> it appears that not a single Pagan/Jew converted to Islam as a result of these revelatory answers</span></em></strong><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">.</span></em> Why?</p>
<p>In the second part of this series, we saw that pagans and Jews constantly asked Muhammad to show them any miracle. The Quran records many excuses from Muhammad for his inability to show any miracle, <span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><em><strong>but neither Muhammad nor the Quran once used these three answers as proof of miracle</strong></em></span>. Why?</p>
<p>Moreover, please also reflect on this question: "Was there any <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>MIRACOLOUS Information</strong></span> present in the 3 answers that Muhammad provided"? The story of Alexander the Great was well-known among the masses, as was the story of the sleepers in the cave.  And would it not be logical that Allah would have told the exact numbers, so that Muhammad should not have to enquire their numbers from them? Similarly, how can Muhammad's response, “The Spirit belongs to the domain of my Lord; and you were given only little knowledge,” be considered "<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>miraculous information</strong></span>?" Please ask this question to yourself, if it was not possible for any false prophet to gather such superficial (non-miraculous information) during those 15 days? </p>

			<title>Free Will Doesn't Exist In Islam</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<h1>Summary:</h1>
<p>The concept of free will and predestination (Al-Qadr) contradict each other, and we can see the emphasis on the latter in many quranic verses and authentic narrations.</p>
<p>The narrations included in the list below prove that Allah creates people who are evil/disobedient by nature then punishes them for something they cannot control, that is their disbelief and sins. The sins that we (and the prophets too) commit were all predetermined by Allah himself before we were even created, yet we're punished for them despite us having no choice at all.</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">An Argument Between Adam And Moses</h2>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Moses argued with Adam and said to him: <strong>"You are the one who got mankind out of Paradise because of your sin, and thus made them miserable."</strong> Adam replied: <strong>"O Moses! You are the one whom Allah had selected for His Message and for His direct talk. Yet you blame me for a thing which Allah had ordained for me before He even created me?"</strong> Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) further said: "<strong>So Adam overcame Moses by this argument."</strong></p>
<p>(<a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6614" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6614</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4738" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4738</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2652d" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2652d</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4736" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4736</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2652b" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2652b</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2652c" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2652c</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4701" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4701</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:80" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:80</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/mishkat:81" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/mishkat:81</a>)</p>
<p>For context, this happened during the 'Isra event when Muhammad went to the heavens to debate Allah and won, but that's another story.</p>
<p>These narrations clearly imply the original sin was not Adam's fault, because he had no choice in this matter as his actions were all predetermined to happen by Allah before Adam or Satan were even created. And I find it very interesting how Adam blamed this on Allah's predestination rather than on Satan's luring.</p>
<p>If Adam had free will, we would be able to blame him for his actions in the garden yet we can't, because according to him he was preordained by Allah to do it before his creation. So who's really responsible for the actions that caused the fall of man from paradise?</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">Allah Predetermines The Fate Of Those Who Aren't Born Yet</h2>
<p>Aisha, the mother of believers, narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was called to the funeral of a child from among the Ansar. She said: <strong>"O Messenger of Allah, glad tidings for him! He is one of the little birds of Paradise, who never did evil or reached the age of doing evil (i.e, the age of accountability)."</strong> He (ﷺ) said: <strong>"It may not be so, Aisha! For Allah created people for Paradise, He created them for it when they were still in their father's loins, And He has created people for Hell, He created them for it when they were still in their fathers' loins."</strong></p>
<p>(<a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2662c" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2662c</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:82" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:82</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4713" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4713</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:1947" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/nasai:1947</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2662b" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2662b</a>)</p>
<p>This is pretty self explanatory. In response to Aisha saying that a prepubescent child (meaning they cannot sin yet) who died is going to heaven, Muhammad claims she can be wrong as Allah already determines the destination of people before they're even born.</p>
<p>The explanation for this hadith also talks about how this proves predetermination and 'the preserved tablet' (<a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/152539" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sharh Al-Hadith</a>)</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">Deeds Are Already Preordained Before Creation</h2>
<p>Suraqah bin Ju'shum said: <strong>"O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), is one's deed in that which has already dried of the Pen (after recording them) and what has passed of the Divine Decree (Al-Qadr), or is it in the future?"</strong> He (ﷺ) said: <strong>"No, it is in that which what has already dried of the Pen and what has passed of the Divine Decree, and each person is facilitated for what they have been created."</strong></p>
<p>(<a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:91" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:91</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2648a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2648a</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2648b" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2648b</a>)</p>
<p>Muhammad singlehandedly disproved the existence of free will with this one response. He states the deeds people do are what has already been written for them in their destinies (Divine Decree), and the actions they will do in the future are already decided in their destinies.</p>
<p>Meaning if someone were to leave Islam, it's because this outcome was already decided for him in his destiny which cannot be changed. It's not truly him who is responsible for his apostasy... but the one who is writing his unchangeable destiny.</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">Fate Is Preordained When One Is In The Womb</h2>
<p>Abdullah bin Mas'ud reported: <strong>"Evil one is he who is evil in the womb of his mother and the good one is he who takes a lesson from the (fate of) others."</strong> The narrator came to a person from amongst the Companions of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who was called Hudhaifa bin Usaid Ghifari and said: "<strong>How can a person be an evil one without committing an evil deed?"</strong> Thereupon the person said to him: You are surprised at this, whereas I have heard The Prophet (ﷺ) as saying:</p>
<p><strong>"When the drop of semen remains in the womb for forty or forty five nights, Allah sends an angel into the womb and he says: 'My Lord, will he be good or evil?' And both these things would be written. Then the angel says: 'My Lord, would he be male or female?' And both these things are written.</strong> <strong>And whether he will be a wretched one or a blessed one (in the Hereafter), and his deeds and actions, his death, his livelihood; these are also recorded. Then his document of destiny is rolled and there is no addition to nor subtraction from it, then the soul is breathed into his body. So a man may do deeds characteristic of the people of the Hellfire, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and so he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and enters Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of the people of the Hellfire and enters the Hellfire."</strong></p>
<p>(<a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2645a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2645a</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7454" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7454</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3333" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3333</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3332" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3332</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6595" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6595</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2646" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2646</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2644" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2644</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2645c" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2645c</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4708" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4708</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:396" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:396</a>)</p>
<p>The actions, characteristics, date of death, and fate in the hereafter of everyone is already predetermined while they're still in their mother's womb. There is no way one has free will if everything they will ever do in life is already written down for them by their creator in a scroll that cannot be changed.</p>
<p>And I also find it weird how Allah is constantly mad at disbelievers in the quran... when he himself has ordained for them to disbelieve before they were even born.</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">People Do The Deeds They Were Created For</h2>
<p>A man said: <strong>"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Can the people of Paradise be known (differentiated) from the people of the Fire?"</strong> The Prophet (ﷺ) replied: <strong>"Yes."</strong> The man said: <strong>"Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?"</strong> The Prophet (ﷺ) said: <strong>"Everyone will do the deeds for which they have been created to do or they will do those deeds which will be made easy for them to do."</strong> (i.e. everybody will find easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been created for)</p>
<p>While we were sitting with The Prophet (ﷺ) who had a stick with which he was scraping the earth, he lowered his head and said: <strong>"There is none of you but has his place assigned either in the Fire or in Paradise."</strong> Thereupon a man from the people said: <strong>"Shall we not depend upon this, O Allah's Apostle?"</strong> The Prophet (ﷺ) said: <strong>"No, but carry on and do your deeds, for everybody finds it easy to do such deeds (as will lead him to his place)."</strong></p>
<p>Imran said: <strong>"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Why should a doer (people) try to do good deeds?"</strong> The Prophet (ﷺ) replied: <strong>"Everybody will find easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been created."</strong></p>
<p>(<a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6596" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6596</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6605" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6605</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7551" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7551</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7552" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7552</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4949" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4949</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2649a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2649a</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2648a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2648a</a>)</p>
<p>According to these narrations, people whom Allah has created SPECIFICALLY for paradise will find it easier to do good deeds, and likewise people whom Allah has created SPECIFICALLY for hell will find it easier to sin.</p>
<p>If Allah wanted to stay up to his name "The Just" العدل, how about actually creating people equally? Instead of assigning each person for heaven or hell, which leads them to automatically start doing deeds fit for them <em>without their own will</em>?</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">Abu Huraira's Problem</h2>
<p>Abu Huraira said: <strong>"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I am a young man and I am afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse and I cannot afford to marry."</strong> He (ﷺ) kept silent, and then he repeated the question once again, but he (ﷺ) kept silent. He said the same thing for the third time and he (ﷺ) remained silent. Then he repeated the question for the fourth time, and only then The Prophet (ﷺ) said: <strong>"Abu Huraira, the pen has written all it has to write about your destiny. So have yourself made an eunuch on that account, or leave things as they are.”</strong></p>
<p>(<a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5076" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5076</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3215" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/nasai:3215</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/mishkat:88" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/mishkat:88</a>)</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">Justification For Murdering A Child (Moses &amp; Al-Khidr)</h2>
<p>For context, the following verses come from a story in Surat Al-Kahf (Verses 18:60-82) about Moses meeting a wise man named Al-Khidr, who has knowledge of the future and he takes Moses on a lesson. The whole story is extremely flawed for multiple reasons and <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHgJff-fJAI" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this video by Apostate Aladdin</a> explains why pretty well. But for now, I will focus on a certain part of the story, and that's when Al-Khidr murders a little kid on the basis that the child was destined to become a disbeliever when he grows up:</p>
<p><strong>So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man (Al-Khidr) killed him. Moses protested: "Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one?! You have certainly done a horrible thing!"</strong> (18:74)</p>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said : Al-Khidr saw a young boy playing with his friends. He took him by his head and uprooted it. Moses then said: <strong>"Hast thou slain an innocent person who had slain none?!"</strong></p>
<p>(<a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:122" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:122</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4707" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4707</a>)</p>
<p><strong>He answered: "Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?"</strong> (18:75)</p>
<p><strong>Moses replied: "If I ever question you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company, for by then I would have given you enough of an excuse."</strong> (18:76)</p>
<p><strong>"And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would pressure them into defiance and disbelief.</strong> <strong>So we hoped that their Lord would give them another, more virtuous and caring in his place."</strong> (18:80-81)</p>
<p><strong>"This is the explanation of what you could not bear patiently."</strong> (18:82)</p>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said: <strong>"The boy that Al-Khidr killed was destined to be a disbeliever the day he was created. Had he lived, he would have moved his parents to rebellion and disbelief."</strong></p>
<p>(<a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2662a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/muslim:2662a</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3150" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3150</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4705" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4705</a>, <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4706" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4706</a>)</p>
<p>The justification for murdering a little kid in front of his playmates... is because he would grow up to be a disbeliever and move his parents into disbelief. According to Muhammad, this kid was DESTINED to become a disbeliever, meaning he had no choice in this matter at all. He couldn't control his beliefs because it was in his destiny that he would be a disbeliever.</p>
<p>So instead of giving him actual free will and letting him pick his beliefs for himself, he is instead murdered for something he cannot control or change; something Allah has predetermined for him before he was even born.</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">Belief Happens Only By Allah's Will</h2>
<p><strong>Surely this ˹Quran˺ is only a reminder to the whole world to whoever of you wills to take the Straight Path. But you cannot will ˹to do so˺, except by the Will of Allah, the Lord of all worlds.</strong> (81:27-29)</p>
<p><strong>Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam.</strong> (6:125)</p>
<p><strong>Surely this is a reminder. So let whoever wills take the ˹Right˺ Path to their Lord. But you cannot will ˹to do so˺ unless Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</strong> <strong>He admits whoever He wills into His mercy.</strong> (76:29-31)</p>
<p><strong>You surely cannot guide whoever you like ˹O Prophet˺, but it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills, and He knows best who are ˹fit to be˺ guided.</strong> (28:56)</p>
<p>Every muslim lurker on this sub should read that last verse. Stop coming here trying to convert us, just read what the quran says xD</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">Disbelief Happens Also By Allah's Will</h2>
<p><strong>Whoever He wills to leave astray, He makes their chest tight and constricted as if they were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah dooms those who disbelieve.</strong> (6:125)</p>
<p><strong>There are some of them who ˹pretend to˺ listen to your recitation ˹of the Quran˺, but We have cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend it—and deafness in their ears. Even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them.</strong> (6:25)</p>
<p><strong>And who does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord’s revelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have done? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ invite them to ˹true˺ guidance, they will never be ˹rightly˺ guided.</strong> (18:57)</p>
<p><strong>Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their sight is covered. They will suffer a tremendous punishment.</strong> (2:7)</p>
<p>So Allah goes around "sealing the hearts" of the disbelievers in Quraysh then complains about them not believing in him... makes total sense.</p>
<p>I've seen apologists claim that Allah only seals the hearts of disbelievers if they're persistent in their disbelief, but why even do that in the first place? What if the disbeliever saw something that would've convinced them, but their heart was sealed so it didn't convince them? It wouldn't be the disbeliever's fault then, but Allah's.</p>
<h2 class="text-18 xs:text-20">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Allah complains so much in the quran about disbelievers not worshipping him, calling them "the worst of creatures" (98:6) and many other <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/584mgn/allah_the_insult_god/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">childish insults</a>, yet he's the main cause of their disbelief by destining them to become disbelievers before they were even created.</p>
<p>So according to these hadiths and verses, every ex-muslim disbelieves because Allah has destined for them to do so before they were even created. If you're reading this post right now, it's because Allah has preordained you to do so, not because you clicked on it by your own will.</p>
<p>Allah destines people to become disbelievers and to sin, then punishes them ETERNALLY for this despite them having no control over what they've been destined to do. Allah is blaming people for something he inflicted upon them, and torturing them for it as if they had a choice.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId513390"></a>Following Jews and limiting the maximum number of wives to 4</h2>
<p>The polytheists, but democratic Romans were pioneers in ending polygamy, and their influence led to the Christians also abandoning the practice. Similarly, Jews were moving away from polygamy and attempting to restrict it to a maximum of four wives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><span id="header_title_text">Shulchan Aruch</span></b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polygamy&amp;oldid=816682321#Judaism"> <i>by </i></a><span id="header_author_text">Yosef Karo (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130406020341/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch/Even_ha-Ezer/1">link</a>):</span></p>
<p>"<b>Paragraph 9</b> — A man may marry a number of women provided that he has the means to sustain them, and what we find is that the <strong>sages gave worthy suggestion</strong> that a man marry <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">no more than four women</span> so that he may fulfill his sexual obligation once a month. <strong>In a place where they are accustomed to only marry one woman they are not permitted to marry another woman</strong>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon arriving in Medina, Muhammad incorporated several Jewish customs to appease the Jewish community. As a result, in the 3rd Hijri year, Muhammad implemented the restriction of having a maximum of four wives, following the revelation of verse 4:3. At that time, Muhammad himself already had four wives: Sawdah, 'Aisha, Hafsa, and Umm Salama.</p>
<p>However, this limitation on the number of wives posed a predicament for Muhammad when he found himself attracted to Zaynab, the wife of his adopted son, after seeing her while she was not properly dressed.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId537130"></a>The 1st Role of Revelation about Zaynab bint Jahsh</h2>
<p>Zayd, who was previously a slave, was adopted by Muhammad as his son. Later, Muhammad proposed to his cousin sister Zaynab that she marry Zayd. However, Zaynab expressed her disinterest in the proposal, as she came from a respected family and was considered a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>In response to Zaynab's refusal, Muhammad promptly claimed to receive a new revelation, which seemed to fulfill his own desire. This revelation implied that Zaynab had no further say in the matter and was compelled to abide by Muhammad's decision, despite her personal preferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.36">33:36</a>):<br>It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite Muhammad's success in enforcing Zaynab's marriage to Zayd, their union was plagued by unhappiness. The circumstances deteriorated to such an extent that even Zayd himself desired to end the relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081127160919/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/093.sbt.html">Sahih Bukhari</a>:<br>Zaid bin Haritha came to the Prophet complaining about his wife. The Prophet kept on saying (to him), "Be afraid of Allah and keep your wife."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId637474"></a>The 2nd Role of Revelation when Muhammad fell in love with Zaynab</h2>
<p>Initially, Zaynab was married to Zaid ibn Haritha, who was adopted by Muhammad as his son. One day, Muhammad went to Zaid's house seeking his counsel on a matter, but Zaid was absent. Unexpectedly, Zaynab, dressed in revealing attire, answered the door. It was at this moment that Muhammad developed a strong attraction towards her.</p>
<p>Using a revelation once again, Muhammad managed to marry Zaynab as his fifth wife, surpassing the earlier limit of four wives. Notably, Muhammad did not give Zaynab the option to consent to the marriage; instead, he claimed that Allah had already decreed their marriage in the heavens. This marriage occurred without Zaynab's consent, without the customary Haq-Mehr (bride price), and without any witnesses present.</p>
<p>Muslim historian al-Tabari recorded in his book (<a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=4A-4ZC4l0dMC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Messenger+of+God,+perhaps+Zaynab+has+excited+your+admiration,+and+so+I+will+separate+myself+from+her.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pHGuPqZdDA&amp;sig=ACfU3U17cfoJ0NmgkK1QUJl9stKw_yrYtw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwid9oLDkuvgAhUFIVAKHTPmBk8Q6AEwAnoECDAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Messenger%20of%20God%2C%20perhaps%20Zaynab%20has%20excited%20your%20admiration%2C%20and%20so%20I%20will%20separate%20myself%20from%20her.&amp;f=false">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of God came to the house of Zayd b. Harithah. (Zayd was always called Zayd b. Muhammad.) Perhaps the Messenger of God missed him at that moment, so as to ask, “Where is Zayd?” He came to his residence to look for him but did not find him. Zaynab bt. Jash, Zayd’s wife, rose to meet him.<strong> Because she was dressed only in a shift, the Messenger of God turned away from her.</strong> She said: “He is not here, Messenger of God. Come in, you who are as dear to me as my father and mother!” The Messenger of God refused to enter. <strong>Zaynab had dressed in haste</strong> when she was told “the Messenger of God is at the door.” She jumped up in haste and excited the admiration of the Messenger of God, so that he turned away murmuring something that could scarcely be understood. However, he did say overtly: <strong>“Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!</strong>” When Zayd came home, his wife told him that the Messenger of God had come to his house. Zayd said, “Why didn’t you ask him to come in?” He replied, “I asked him, but he refused.” “Did you hear him say anything?” he asked. She replied, “As he turned away, I heard him say: ‘Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes hearts to turn!’”<em><br></em>So Zayd left, and having come to the Messenger of God, he said: “Messenger of God, I have heard that you came to my house. Why didn’t you go in, you who are as dear to me as my father and mother? Messenger of God, perhaps Zaynab has excited your admiration, and so I will separate myself from her.” Zayd could find no possible way to [approach] her after that day (i.e. to have sex with her). He would come to the Messenger of God and tell him so, but the Messenger of God would say to him, <strong>“Keep your wife.</strong>” When Zaid mentioned his intention to separate from Zainab to the prophet, <strong>the prophet told him, “Retain thou thy wife” even though the prophet desired that they separate so that he could marry her</strong>. Zayd separated from her and left her, and she became free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad then claimed the revelation of the following verse, in which he tried to shift the blame from himself to the command of Allah. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://quranx.com/33.37">Quran 33:37</a>)<br>And [remember, O Muhammad], when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed <strong>favor</strong> and you bestowed <strong>favor</strong>, "Keep your wife and fear Allah,"<strong> while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose.</strong> <strong>And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him</strong>. So, when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad, being concerned about public perception, faced several reasons for apprehension:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, marrying one's daughter-in-law contradicted the moral standards of that society.</li>
<li>Secondly, Muhammad's utterance of the phrase "Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!" upon leaving Zaynab was considered inappropriate and shameful, particularly towards his daughter-in-law.</li>
<li>Furthermore, Muhammad already had four wives at that time, and he had previously declared through a revelation that the maximum number of wives allowed was four, including himself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, Muhammad attempted to resolve and conceal the issue by advising Zayd not to divorce Zaynab. However, the matter eventually became public knowledge, exposing Muhammad's words.</p>
<p>Realizing that the issue could no longer be hidden and that his desire for Zaynab persisted, Muhammad resorted to the familiar approach of claiming a "Revelation" in order to take Zaynab as his fifth wife.</p>
<p>Islamic apologists present an argument that Allah intended to break the custom of prohibiting marriage with the wives of adopted sons during the era of ignorance, using this as a justification for Muhammad marrying Zaynab.</p>
<p>However, the Quran itself contradicts this excuse put forth by Islamic apologists. The Quran acknowledges that Muhammad's <strong>primary</strong> motivation was his personal desire for Zaynab. While the issue of marrying the wives of adopted sons was <strong>secondary</strong>, Muhammad did not need to carry it out practically. It would have been sufficient for him to communicate it orally, as he did with all other matters such as abstaining from alcohol or avoiding fornication. All of his companions (Sahaba) accepted his verbal instructions, so there was no reason why they would not have accepted his verbal instructions regarding the wives of adopted sons.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId403413"></a>The 3rd Role of Revelation: Verse 33:38 declares that Allah commanded Muhammad to marry Zaynab</h2>
<p>The matter of Muhammad falling in love with Zaynab raised significant doubts about his prophethood and his character. Its repercussions were so profound that Muhammad found himself resorting to repeated use of revelations to extricate himself from this uncomfortable situation.</p>
<p>In an effort to absolve himself of responsibility for this marriage, Muhammad went a step further and proclaimed that it was Allah who had ordained it upon him, attributing it to his predestined fate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.38">33:38</a>):<br>مَّا كَانَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِىِّ مِنْ حَرَجٍ فِيمَا فَرَضَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُۥ ۖ سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ فِى ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا۟ مِن قَبْلُ ۚ وَكَانَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ قَدَرًا مَّقْدُورًا<br>There is not to be upon the Prophet any discomfort concerning that which Allah has imposed upon him. [This is] the established practice of Allah with those [prophets] who have passed on before. And the commandment of Allah is certain destiny</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId744208"></a>The 4th Role of Revelation: The wedding took place directly in the heavens </h2>
<p>The process of marriage typically involves several steps, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>The man proposing to the woman.</li>
<li>The woman accepting the proposal.</li>
<li>Agreeing upon the Haq-Mehr (bride price).</li>
<li>Pronouncing the Nikah (marriage contract) with the consent of both parties.</li>
<li>Having witnesses present to validate the marriage.</li>
<li>Often followed by a wedding feast or celebration.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, Muhammad's eagerness to marry Zaynab was such that he did not wait for the customary procedures, including obtaining proper consent, settling the Haq-Mehr, or having witnesses present. Instead, he directly entered Zaynab's room, asserting that Allah had already united them in marriage in the heavens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.quranexplorer.com/hadithebook/english/index.html?page=Hadith%2Fbukhari%2F009.093.516.html">Sahih Bukhari</a>:<br>Zainab used to boast before the wives of the Prophet and used to say, "You were given in marriage by your families, while I was married (to the Prophet) by Allah from over seven Heavens."</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1428b">Sahih Muslim</a>:<br>When the 'Iddah of Zainab was over, Allah's Messenger said to Zaid to make a mention to her about him … Zaynab replied (to Zaid about the proposal): I do not do anything until I solicit the will of my Lord. So she stood at her place of worship and the (verse of) the Qur'an (pertaining to her marriage) were revealed, and Allah's Messenger came to her without permission (i.e. he entered her room without permission). </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId62999"></a>The 5th Role of Revelation: Declaring Adopted Children are not part of the families </h2>
<p>More verses were then revealed to sweep away any doubt about the lawfulness of the marriage between Mohammed and his adoptive son’s wife. How did it work? That’s pretty simple: every adoption was called off and therefore Zayd’s status changed, from “adoptive son” to “former adoptive son”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.40">33:40</a>):<br>Muhammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and last of the prophets</p>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.4">33:4</a>):<br>Allah has not made for a man two hearts in his interior. And He has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful your mothers. And he has not made your adopted sons your [true] sons. That is [merely] your saying by your mouths, but Allah says the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Kathir says in Tafsir of verse 33:4 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;tAyahNo=4&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar said: "Zayd bin Muhammad, may Allah be pleased with him, the freed servant of the Messenger of Allah was ALWAYS CALLED Zayd bin Muhammad, UNTIL (the words of the) QUR'AN WERE REVEALED …<br>&lt;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.&gt;"<br>This was also narrated by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa’i. They used to deal with them as sons in every respect, including being alone with them as Mahrams and so on. Hence, Sahlah bint Suhaly, the wife of Abu Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: "O Messenger of Allah! We used to call Salim our son, but Allah has revealed what He has revealed. He used to enter upon me, but I feel that Abu Hudhayfah does not like that." The Prophet said ...<br>((Breastfeed him and he will become your Mahram.))</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId782165"></a>The 6th Role of Revelation: Driving people out of his home quickly, so that he could enjoy Zaynab</h2>
<p>Initially, Muhammad declared that Allah had already united him with Zaynab in celestial matrimony, enabling him to enter Zaynab's quarters directly, without the formalities of a marriage contract or witnesses.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, later on, Muhammad organized a marriage feast, known as the Walima. However, as the guests lingered in his house following the meal, Muhammad's desire to be with Zaynab again grew impatient.</p>
<p>When the guests overstayed their welcome, Muhammad promptly invoked a revelation once more, in order to hasten their departure from his residence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.53?context=3">33:53</a>):<br>O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But Allah is not shy of the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also see this Hadith of Sahih Bukhari (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6238">link</a>),  in which Anas recounts the aforementioned incident, including the revelation of the verse when people failed to promptly vacate the prophet's house after the meal.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId146250"></a>The 7th Role of Revelation: Making marriage lawful for himself with women who presented themselves as a gift (Arabic: هبة)</h2>
<p>Having already surpassed the limits of four wives in the case of Zaynab through the aid of revelation, Muhammad became aware of the immense potential these revelations held in fulfilling his desires.</p>
<p>Then, a captivating woman approached Muhammad and expressed her desire to offer herself as a gift (هبة). As a normal wife, one has some rights like Haq Mahr at the time of Nikah, and then Maintenance Money till she stays as a wife. And then Muhammad had to divide his time equally between them. But the women who gifted themselves to Muhammad, they didn't have any right to anything. In simpler terms, these women were solely intended for sexual services.</p>
<p>Muhammad found the proposition enticing.</p>
<p>However, a predicament arose. The restriction of having only four wives still remained, and Muhammad had not explicitly abrogated it for himself in the case of Zaynab.</p>
<p>Another complication emerged as well. 'Aisha and the other wives grew upset following the incident with Zaynab, and they expressed their anger towards Muhammad for taking another wife.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Muhammad once again invoked revelation, disregarding the limitations of four wives, and declared all women who offered themselves as gifts permissible for him to marry. This time, Muhammad claimed that Quranic verses 33:50 and 33:52 were revealed to justify his actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3">33:50</a>) …  (O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you) <b>any believing woman who presents her soul to the Prophet (as a gift)</b>, and <b>if the Prophet also wishes to wed her</b>;- [this is] <b>only for you [O Muhammad]</b>, excluding the [other] believers. We certainly know what We have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess, [but this is for you] <b>in order that there will be upon you no discomfort.</b><b><br></b>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3">33:51</a>) …..<br>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3">33:52</a>)<b> Not lawful to you, [O Muhammad], are [any additional] women after [this], nor [is it] for you to exchange them for [other] wives, even if their beauty were to please you</b>, except the slave women.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of this revelation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, Muhammad freed himself from the limitation of having only four wives.</li>
<li>Muhammad also cunningly ensured that other Muslim men were denied the opportunity to enjoy women who offered themselves as gifts, reserving such women exclusively for himself.</li>
<li>Another shrewd aspect of this revelation was the condition that Muhammad would only accept those women as gifts whom he found desirable. This meant that if a woman presented herself to Muhammad but did not meet his standards of beauty, he had the full right to reject such individuals.</li>
<li>Furthermore, Muhammad left the door open for engaging in sexual relations with slave women.</li>
<li>To appease his wives, including 'Aisha and the other wives, Muhammad also claimed that verse 33:52 was revealed, which prohibited him from marrying any additional women, even if their beauty pleased him, similar to how he was pleased by Zaynab's beauty and married her earlier. Through this verse, Muhammad conveyed that he would remain with his five permanent wives, along with women who presented themselves as gifts, and slave women. Nevertheless, at a later time, Muhammad abrogated verse 33:52 through the revelation of another verse, allowing him to marry women of all types without any restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In his commentary on verse 51 of Surah Al-Ahzab, according to Zamakhshari, he mentions 4 women who gave their bodies to Muhammad for sex (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;tTafsirNo=2&amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;tAyahNo=51&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وقيل الموهوبات أربع ميمونة بنت الحرث، وزينب بنت خزيمة أمّ المساكين الأنصارية، وأمّ شريك بنت جابر، وخولة بنت حكيم -</p>
<p>It is said that the four women, who gifted themselves to Muhammad, were: Maymunah bint Al-Harith, Zaynab bint Khuzayma (Umm Al-Masakin Al-Ansariyyah), Umm Sharik bint Jabir, and Khawlah bint Hakim</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId697995"></a>The revelation remained absent for an entire month during the allegations against 'Aisha, but miraculously appeared instantly when it came to fulfilling Muhammad's sexual desires.</h2>
<p>Despite the presence of verse 33:52, Muhammad's wives, particularly 'Aisha, became enraged when he declared those women who presented themselves as gifts permissible for him.</p>
<p>'Aisha, in particular, expressed her strong displeasure by publicly shaming those women for their actions. Furthermore, she directly criticized Muhammad by sarcastically remarking that Allah promptly fulfills his sexual desires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5113">Sahih Bukhari</a>:<br>Khaula bint Hakim was one of those ladies who presented themselves to the Prophet for marriage.<b> `Aisha said, "Doesn't a lady feel ashamed for presenting herself to a man?" </b>But when the Verse: "(O Muhammad) You may postpone (the turn of) any of them (your wives) that you please,' (33.51) was revealed, " <b>`Aisha said, 'O Allah's Messenger! I do not see, but this, that your Lord hurries in pleasing you</b> <b>(by sending revelations quickly on the spot)</b>' "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proves that even ‘Aisha knew very well that Muhammad was making those revelations on his own. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId817474"></a>The 8th Role of Revelation: Muhammad made all types of women permissible for him to marry without any restrictions</h2>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad first limited himself to 4 wives.</li>
<li>But then he added Zaynab as his 5th wife. </li>
<li>Then he added those women who presented themselves as a gift to him. </li>
<li>But later he made all women lawful for him to marry and without any limits of any number (i.e. he abrogated verse 33:52 too). </li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequently, with Muhammad's rise to power in Medina, verse 33:52 remained an obstacle for him to pursue other women.</p>
<p>In response, Muhammad once again employed the familiar tactic of revelation and effectively abrogated verse 33:52 by claiming the revelation of a different verse. It is noteworthy that through this revelation, Muhammad seemingly manipulated and exerted control over his wives, coercing them to find contentment with what little he provided them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3">33:51</a>) <b>You, [O Muhammad], may put aside (from your wives) whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will.</b> And any that you desire of those [wives] from whom you had [temporarily] separated - there is no blame upon you [in returning her]. <b>That is more suitable that your wives should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them - all of them.</b> And Allah knows what is in your heart. And ever is Allah Knowing and Forbearing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please be aware that according to Muslim Quran Interpreters, verse 33:52 was originally revealed before verse 33:51, despite the current arrangement in the Quran where they appear in the opposite order.</p>

<p>In Ibn Kathir's account, Umm Salama, another wife of Muhammad, confirms that all types of women became permissible for Muhammad to marry without any restrictions on the number. Additionally, Ibn Kathir documents that verse 33:52 was revealed prior to verse 33:51, as noted in his commentary.</p>
<p>Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of verse <a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;tAyahNo=52&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">33:52</a>:</p>

Same is also narrated by Umm Salama. And the verse which is making women lawful to him is 33:51, which is although present earlier than verse 33:52, but it was revealed later than 33:52. This same thing happened in Surah Baqara too, where the new verse which is abrogating the older verse of Iddah (waiting period) is present earlier in order than the one which was abrogated. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, with the revelation of verse 33:51, all restrictions were lifted, granting Muhammad the freedom to marry women in any quantity. This served as the pathway for Muhammad's journey from having four wives to eventually having nine.</p>
<p>Following this development, Muhammad married Juwayriyyah, Ramlah (Umm Habiba), Safiyyah, Maymunah, and various others.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId218576"></a>The 9th Role of Revelation: Muhammad found a way to get rid of his old wife</h2>
<p>As Muhammad grew stronger and wealthier in Medina, he began marrying multiple young and beautiful women, despite his own age ranging between 58 and 63 years. The women he married were generally between the ages of 17 and 35, making Muhammad double, triple, or even four times their age. Islamic traditions highlight that these women, such as Juwayria, Safiyyah, Rehana, Zaynab, and Umm Habiba, were not only young but also exceptionally beautiful.</p>
<p>However, Sawdah was the only wife of Muhammad who was older than the newlywed ladies, though still younger than Muhammad himself. In the presence of his young and attractive wives, Muhammad desired to part ways with Sawdah. Muhammad had married Sawdah in Mecca during a time of weakness and poverty when he faced opposition from the entire city.</p>
<p>To fulfill his wish of separating from Sawdah, Muhammad once again invoked revelation and claimed that Allah had sent the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/33.51">33:51</a>) You, [O Muhammad], may put aside whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, after the revelation of this verse, the only wife whom Muhammad chose to divorce, was the old lady Sawdah. It was despite the fact that Sawdah was serving Muhammad from the time of Mecca, when Muhammad was poor and weak, while other wives were new, and they hardly lived with Muhammad for a few years in Medina. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://daaiyatulislam.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/tafsir-ibn-kathir-surah-4-an-nisa.pdf">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Verse 4:128)</a>, upon learning of Muhammad's intention to divorce her, Sawdah sought refuge in 'Aisha's house. When Muhammad arrived, Sawdah expressed her willingness to give up her turn to 'Aisha but pleaded with him not to divorce her. Muhammad readily agreed and promptly claimed the revelation of the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.128?context=3">4:128-129</a>) And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them (i.e. woman agrees upon leaving some of her rights) … <strong>And you will never be able to do Justice (Arabic: تَعْدِلُوْا) between wives</strong>, even if you should strive [to do so].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, do you notice the contradiction? Previously, the author of the Quran (Muhammad) had established the condition of justice ('adl) for having multiple wives (Quran 4:3). However, in this particular verse (Quran 4:128-129), he permits a husband to manipulate his wives by threatening divorce, thus pressuring them into relinquishing their rights in the name of a settlement. This undermines the requirement of justice, as the husband retains control over the right to divorce, resulting in settlements that consistently favor him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://quranx.com/4.3">Quran 4:3</a>) If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, Two or three or four;<strong> but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one</strong>, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Practically, the verse (Quran 4:128-129) has abrogated the verse of doing justice among multiple wives.</p>
<p>This verse, about usurping the rights of women by blackmailing them, is the base upon which the institution of Misyaar marriage is constructed. And women are openly abused in Misyaar marriage in Arab countries (<a href="https://youtu.be/8EB1JHNaDIM">source</a>). </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId814888"></a>The 10th Role of Revelation: Muhammad deprived his wives of the right to equal time and their turns</h2>
<p>In verse 4:3, Muhammad initially established the condition that husbands must divide their time equally among their four wives, ensuring each wife had her designated turn.</p>
<p>However, he later invoked verse 33:51 to completely exempt himself from this condition, without seeking any consent from his wives.</p>
<p>In the commentary of verse <span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://www.wordofallah.com/tafseer">33:51</a>, Ibn Kathir writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{ تُرْجِى مَن تَشَآءُ مِنْهُنَّ } الآية، أي من أزواجك، لا حرج عليك أن تترك القسم لهن، فتقدم من شئت، وتؤخر من شئت، وتجامع من شئت، وتترك من شئت، هكذا يروى عن ابن عباس ومجاهد والحسن وقتادة وأبي رزين وعبد الرحمن بن زيد بن أسلم وغيرهم<br>Allah’s saying in Quran (i.e. <i>You can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them</i>,) means, 'your wives:<b> there is no sin on you if you stop dividing your time equally between them, and delay the turn of one of them and bring forward the turn of another as you wish, and you have intercourse with one and not another as you wish</b>.' This was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Abu Razin, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, not only Sawdah but all of Muhammad's wives lost their entitlement to equal time and turns.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId513528"></a>The 11th Role of Revelation: Making slave-woman Mariyah again lawful for himself (for sexual intercourse) through the Revelation</h2>
<p>Muhammad had 9 wives and 21 slave women (Source: <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fislamweb.net%2Far%2Flibrary%2Findex.php%3Fpage%3Dbookcontents%26flag%3D1%26bk_no%3D59%26ID%3D588%26fbclid%3DIwAR32OPC0qxmnE67UL8QKzZUyio3UbtCuEuPJZPuAQycRwaiMiQzjf87eNhw&amp;h=AT0VXXder0Xm9MvJwtNOXYDSpYnASNbTDGl-A1KrrlsoO016tRr4e2Jvkeo2KUV5C2mh8i_ZUAdbKvKKL46q1tdRUcN55bXSjlcpCUiOx-Ha9wAgdCzJ7e_IjJjKVAluWqia7yLZS6X58C3G0fT3&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c%5B0%5D=AT0jwI-yqfL27Fowu4QlA5V-_ULhwb4ksbCJPAhDGeK4Qu-UDL99Y4CBX71OwUSKjctmu8AcL7LVq9es_ReMnFqwlxHWFXao11LL3x2gEjP7BzRyVkgTq-xHA8R5V7k_mkXLrPTg4gVa-jf6axWWjHpe0V9sR0G1sbw">Ibn Kathir</a>). One of them was Maria. She was a beautiful lady, and 'Aisha was jealous of her. </p>
<p>Maulana Maudodi recorded in his Tafhim under the commentary of verse <a href="https://www.tafheemulquran.net/1_Tafheem/0_Tafheem.html">66:1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hafidh Ibn Hajr recorded this saying of Hadirhat 'Aisha in his book al-Asaba: "The arrival of any other wife of the prophet did not displease me as much as the arrival of Maria did, because she was beautiful and charming, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) was very fond of her."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad followed a rotational schedule to visit each of his wives. On one such occasion, it was Hafsa's turn, but she had temporarily left to visit her father. Upon her return, Hafsa discovered Muhammad engaged in sexual relations with his slave woman, Maria, in her room. This incident deeply upset Hafsa, prompting Muhammad to swear an oath to refrain from further relations with Maria in order to regain Hafsa's happiness. However, Muhammad requested that Hafsa keep this matter confidential.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hafsa shared the incident with 'Aisha, and it is possible that 'Aisha later observed Muhammad breaking his promise by continuing a discreet relationship with Maria.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959">Sunan Nisai, Hadith 3959</a>:</p>
<blockquote>It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: "O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.<br><em><strong>Grade: Sahih</strong></em> (authentic)</blockquote>
<p>In response to that, Muhammad's anger surged, prompting him to assert the revelation of the following verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/66.1?context=5">66:1-4</a>):<br>O Prophet, why do you forbid what Allah has made lawful for you? Is it to please your wives? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. <strong>Allah has prescribed for you a way for the absolution of your oaths (i.e. the Prophet can make Mariyah permissible again for himself through this process)</strong><strong>. </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And Allah is your protector, and He is the Knowing, the Wise. And [remember] when the Prophet confided to one of his wives a statement; and when she informed [another] of it and Allah showed it to him, he made known part of it and ignored a part. And when he informed her about it, she said, "Who told you this?" He said, "I was informed by the Knowing, the Acquainted." If you two [wives] repent to Allah, [it is best], for your hearts have deviated. <strong>But if you cooperate against him - then indeed Allah is his protector, and Gabriel and the righteous of the believers and the angels, moreover, are [his] assistants</strong>. Perhaps his Lord,<strong> if he divorced you [all], would substitute for him wives better than you - submitting [to Allah], believing, devoutly obedient, repentant, worshipping, and traveling - [ones] previously married and <span style="color: #ff0000;">virgins</span></strong>. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, Muhammad achieved the following goals through this revelation:</p>
<ul>
<li>He succeeded in making beautiful and young Mariyah again permissible for him. </li>
<li>He succeeded in threatening his wives so that they feared him and never dared to criticize and put any restrictions on his sexual activities. </li>
<li>He also taunted them that they were not VIRGINGS. Also, the threat was that Muhammad could divorce all of them and would get a lot more new wives who were better than them in every regard. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId60769"></a>Muhammad also had four concubines with whom he engaged in sexual relations</h2>
<p>Ibn al-Qayyim recorded in his book Zaad al-Ma’aad (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220509160304/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;idfrom=21&amp;idto=21&amp;bk_no=127&amp;ID=23">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>قال أبو عبيدة : كان له أربع : مارية وهي أم ولده إبراهيم ، وريحانة وجارية أخرى جميلة أصابها في بعض السبي ، وجارية وهبتها له <span class="names">زينب بنت جحش </span>.</p>
<p>Abu ‘Ubaydah said: He had four (concubines): Mariyah, who was the mother of his son Ibraaheem; Rayhaanah; another beautiful slave woman whom he acquired as a prisoner of war; and a slave woman who was given to him by Zaynab bint Jahsh. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210211034055/https://answering-islam.org/Shamoun/mary_concubine.htm">Please read more details here</a>. </p>
<p>It is important to note that Muhammad's living quarters were limited as he had a small house attached to the mosque. Due to the lack of space, there was no room for additional concubines. However, on one occasion, Muhammad engaged in sexual relations with Mariyah in Hafsa's room. Hafsa unexpectedly returned and discovered them together. This incident ignited her anger, leading her to inform Aisha as well. Consequently, both Hafsa and Aisha prevented Muhammad from being alone with Maria, prompting Muhammad to make a solemn oath not to have sexual relations with her.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959">Sunan Nisai, Hadith 3959</a>:</p>
<blockquote>It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId938882"></a>16 Special Privileges, which Muhammad reserved for himself through Revelation</h2>
<p>Al-Qurtubi is a famous Quranic Scholar. He lists those 16 special privileges, which Muhammad reserved only for himself through revelation, including the right to take another man’s wife if he so desired:</p>
<ul>
<li>First: To be fair with the spoils.</li>
<li>Second: To (forcefully) take a fifth of a fifth or just a fifth (of the spoils of war).</li>
<li>Third: "Al Wisal" (Dimitrius- the fast or fasting. This usually refers to fasting or abstaining from food.)</li>
<li><em><strong>Fourth: To take more than four women.</strong></em></li>
<li>Fifth: To marry, "Yas-tan-kih" (or have intercourse), with a woman who verbally pronounces her dedication (to the prophet).</li>
<li>Sixth: To marry, "Yas-tan-kih," without the presence (or permission) of a legal guardian.</li>
<li>Seventh: To marry, "Yas-tan-kih," without a dowry.</li>
<li><strong><em>Eighth: To marry (and have intercourse) during a state of ritual consecration and purification.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Ninth: The annulment of an oath he may make to his wives.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Tenth: If Muhammad looks at a woman (and desires her) THEN IT IS NECESSARY FOR HER HUSBAND TO DIVORCE HER AND FOR MUHAMMAD TO MARRY HER. </em></strong>Ibn Al A’raby said, "This is what the servant of the two holy mosques has also said, as was clear to the scholars FROM THE STORY OF ZAID which also had this meaning."</li>
<li>Eleventh: That the prophet released Safiyyah (from her captured status) and he considered her release as her dowry.</li>
<li>Twelfth: To enter Mecca without being in a state of ritual purification.</li>
<li>Thirteenth: To fight in Mecca.</li>
<li>Fourteenth: That he is not inherited by anyone at all. This was mentioned in the oath of absolution for when a man approaches death due to illness, most of his possessions are taken away, so that he does not have more than a third left for him. But the possessions of the prophet remained for him, as is evidenced in the verse of inheritance and in Surat Mariam.</li>
<li><strong><em>Fifteenth: His marriage is still considered effective after his death (i.e. his widows were not allowed to marry any other man after him).</em></strong></li>
<li>Sixteenth: If he divorces a woman, she remains prohibited to everyone and may not be married, to someone else.</li>

<p><!--StartFragment --></p>
<p>Differentiating between the real incident of the Satanic Verses and the fictitious novel by Salman Rushdie is of utmost importance. The authentic incident sheds light on the fallibility within the claimed divine revelation, challenging the existence of a heavenly Allah and suggesting that Muhammad himself was responsible for the revelation, resulting in human errors within it.</p>
<p>No other event exposes the human errors within the alleged divine revelation as clearly as the original incident of the Satanic Verses. Unfortunately, a vast majority of people, including Muslims, are unaware of this significant event.</p>
<p>The lack of awareness can be attributed to the confusion caused by Mr. Rushdie's fictional novel, also titled "Satanic Verses," which bears little resemblance to the actual incident. Regrettably, this misunderstanding has prevented the true incident of the Satanic Verses from reaching the masses. Presently, people struggle to distinguish between reality and fiction.</p>
<p>Islamic apologists have capitalized on this situation, exploiting it to incite hatred among Muslim youth against the West.</p>
<p>While Mr. Rushdie cannot be held responsible for this situation, as he is an intelligent writer who observed contradictions within the purported divine revelation, he was neither an Islamic scholar nor equipped to withstand the ensuing life-threatening attacks. The responsibility to make the world aware of the original incident primarily lies with scholars of Islamic studies and perhaps ex-Muslims as well.</p>
<p>In the realm of Islamic Studies, significant scholarly research on the incident of the Satanic Verses emerged in 2017 with the publication of <a href="https://nes.princeton.edu/publications/contributor/ahmed-shahab">Mr. Shahab Ahmed's</a> book titled "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Before-Orthodoxy-Satanic-Verses-Early-ebook/dp/B0747JQKKV/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QL2JE8QNYVFN&amp;keywords=Before+Orthodoxy%3A+The+Satanic+Verses+in+Early+Islam&amp;qid=1660673380&amp;sprefix=before+orthodoxy+the+satanic+verses+in+early+islam%2Caps%2C437&amp;sr=8-1">Before Orthodoxy: The Satanic Verses in Early Islam.</a>" This groundbreaking work encompasses a collection of 50 traditions related to the incident.</p>
<p>Mr. Shahab Ahmed, a brilliant individual, authored an extraordinary book. However, it remains incomplete as he intended to write the second and third volumes before his untimely death in 2015 at the age of 48 due to leukemia. His passing was a profound loss. Nevertheless, we are fortunate that the first volume of his remarkable work was published in 2017 even after his demise. We express gratitude to all those involved in making the publication of this book possible.</p>
<p>Let us now present the actual incident of the Satanic Verses, highlighting its importance and emphasizing why it is crucial for the entire world to be aware of it.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId451818"></a>Background and Summary of 50 Traditions on the Incident of Satanic Verses</h2>
<p>In ancient Mecca, the pagan society was characterized by illiteracy and superstition. They worshipped multiple gods and were open to the introduction of new deities, as evidenced by the presence of 360 idols in the Ka'ba, each representing different tribes. However, they fiercely opposed anyone who questioned the authenticity of their gods, particularly because their economy was intertwined with the worship of these deities. The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca brought wealth and prosperity to the city.</p>
<p>When Muhammad established his new religion, he made the mistake of challenging the pagan gods, asserting that they were false. This threatened the Meccans' religious and economic interests, as they feared losing the significance of their gods. Prior to Muhammad, both Jews and Christians had made similar attempts to disprove pagan gods, but they had failed.</p>
<p>Consequently, the people of Mecca vehemently reacted against Muhammad and his followers. The situation became so hostile that many of his followers were forced to flee Mecca and seek refuge in Abyssinia to save their lives.</p>
<p>Realizing his error, Muhammad devised a new plan to reconcile with the Meccans. He aimed to convince them to accept Allah as a new god and himself as a prophet by praising their pagan gods. As part of this plan, Muhammad began expressing his "desire" for Allah to acknowledge the high status of the Meccan gods.</p>
<p>During a gathering of the Quraysh, Muhammad claimed that Allah had started revealing messages to him through the angel Gabriel. It was on this occasion that he recited Surah an-Najm.</p>
<p>Within Surah an-Najm, Muhammad also acknowledged the pagan goddesses and praised their elevated status and ability to intercede. This praise consisted of a total of four verses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَاللاتِ وَالْعُزَّى وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةِ الأُخْرَى، فَإِنَّهُنَّ الْغَرَانِيقُ الْعُلَى وَإِنَّ شفاعتهن لَتُرْتَجَى</p>
<p>Verse 1: Have you pondered upon al-Lat and al-Uzza, the goddesses?</p>
<p>Verse 2: And Manat, the third goddess?</p>
<p>Verse 3: These (3 goddesses) are like high flying cranes (i.e. they are of high status);</p>
<p>Verse 4: Verily their intercession is accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon completing Surah an-Najm, Muhammad prostrated himself, and the Quraysh also followed suit, accepting the elevated status of their goddesses.</p>
<p>The pagan goddesses were given a resemblance to high-flying cranes while 'high flying', metaphorically meant flying high close to the heavens where Allah is physically present - to act as intercessors.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad's plan ultimately failed, as people observed clear contradictions in the divine revelation. Previous revelations had consistently denounced pagan gods as false deities, while this new revelation affirmed their authenticity, high status, and ability to intercede.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Meccan pagans easily concluded that Allah did not exist in the heavens and that Muhammad himself was fabricating these revelations. They ridiculed Muhammad even more after this incident.</p>
<p>Faced with the failure of his plan, Muhammad resorted to a new narrative. He claimed that Allah had not revealed anything about the elevated status of the pagan gods, but rather, it was his own mistake. He asserted that Satan had led him astray, resulting in the utterance of the two Satanic Verses.</p>
<p>In this newly made story, Muhammad told Quraysh that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad received a visit from Gabriel in the evening, who requested him to repeat the verses previously revealed to him.</li>
<li>Consequently, Muhammad recited before Gabriel the verses that praised the gods worshipped by the Quraysh, unaware that these were the Satanic verses.</li>
<li>Upon hearing this, Gabriel informed Muhammad that those verses were not the ones originally conveyed by Allah, but were in fact the Satanic verses that Satan had caused him to recite.</li>
<li>Following this revelation, Muhammad proclaimed that Allah had sent two additional verses as divine revelation, which are as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm">Surah Hajj 22:52-53</a>):</p>
<p> وَمَا أَرْ‌سَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّ‌سُولٍ وَلَا نَبِيٍّ إِلَّا إِذَا <b>تَمَنَّىٰ</b> أَلْقَى الشَّيْطَانُ فِي <b>أُمْنِيَّتِهِ فَيَنسَخُ </b>اللَّـهُ مَا يُلْقِي الشَّيْطَانُ ثُمَّ يُحْكِمُ اللَّـهُ آيَاتِهِ ۗ وَاللَّـهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ۔ لِيَجْعَلَ مَا يُلْقِي الشَّيْطَانُ فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ وَالْقَاسِيَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ لَفِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ</p>
And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '<b>desires' (Arabic:</b><a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29"><b> </b>tamannā</a><b> تمنی)</b>, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his <b>desire (Arabic: </b><a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:15%29">um'niyyatihi</a><b> أُمْنِيَّتِهِ)</b>, so God <b>'abrogates' </b>what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His verses precise again (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). And Allah is Knowing and Wise. He (Allah) makes, what is thrown in by Shaitan (Satan), a <b>Test </b>for those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy and disbelief) and whose hearts are hardened. </blockquote>
<p>The two new verses of Surah al-Hajj served multiple purposes, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The First Purpose</strong>: One objection raised by the pagans was why Muhammad, being the chosen prophet of Allah, could be misled by Satan. To address this objection, Muhammad clarified through these verses that his momentary misguidance did not undermine the divine nature of his religion. He explained that all previous prophets had also experienced similar temptations from Satan due to their human desires.</li>
<li><strong>The Second Purpose</strong>: Muhammad needed to eliminate the presence of the Satanic Verses, which praised the pagan goddesses, from the Quran. To achieve this objective, the new verses revealed that Allah had abrogated and rectified what the devil had inserted. This emphasized that Allah's true verses were made precise again, nullifying any influence from Satan.</li>
<li><strong>The Third Purpose</strong>: The pagans questioned why Allah had allowed Satan to misguide Muhammad and why any mistakes in the verses were not corrected immediately. In response, Muhammad offered an explanation that Allah had permitted Satan's interference as a "<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>test</strong></span>" for those whose hearts harbored diseases or weaknesses. This excuse presented it as an opportunity for individuals to demonstrate their steadfastness and faithfulness. </li>

<p><strong>Note: It is worth noting that Muhammad utilized this tactic of declaring "mistakes" of Allah as "TEST" from Allah on various occasions throughout his life. For example:</strong></p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId74363"></a>The words DESIRE and INTERCESSION in these verses make it impossible to deny the incident of Satanic Verses</h2>
<p>Please note that Islamic apologists today deny that verses 19 to 26 of Surah an-Najm have anything to do with the incident of Satanic Verses, as they deny the occurrence of this incident altogether.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the presence of the words DESIRE and INTERCESSION in these verses is very important, as it makes it impossible for them to deny the occurrence of this incident. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Verse 24):  Or shall man have whatever he <strong>'desires' (Arabic:<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29"> tamannā</a> تمنی) </strong> <br>(Verse 25): To God belong the Last and the First.<br>(Verse 26): How many an angel is there in the heavens whose <strong>intercession</strong> avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The presence of verse 24 in Surah an-Najm  ( <b>أَمْ لِلْإِنسَانِ مَا </b><b>تَمَنَّىٰ</b>  <b>Or shall man have whatever he '</b><b>desires</b><b>'?</b>), provides evidence supporting the authenticity of the incident known as the Satanic Verses as mentioned in the 50 Traditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to note that verse 24, which focuses on fulfilling human <strong>desires</strong>, is totally unrelated (out of context) to the preceding verses that discuss the denial of the high status of pagan gods. </li>
<li aria-level="1">Similarly, this "desire" also has nothing to do with the <strong>proceeding</strong> verses (which talk about the intercession of angels). </li>
</ul>
<p>Given this context, the inclusion of verse 24 at this particular point appears illogical and lacks coherence.</p>
<p>However, if we accept the incident of Satanic Verses indeed happened (as mentioned in those 50 Traditions), then verse 24 of Surah an-Najm immediately starts making <b>perfect</b> <b>sense</b> and <b>perfect</b> <b>logic</b> at this place. It proves that the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) later included this verse 24 (about getting what man desires) here, in order to counter the incident of Satanic Verses, in which he had previously told Meccans about his '<b>desire</b>' for reconciliation with them. </p>
<p>Similarly, the word '<b>intercession</b>' in verse 26 of Surah an-Najm also proves that indeed this verse was also linked to the incident of Satanic Verses. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>(Surah an-Najm, Verse 26)</b> How many angels are there in the heavens whose <b>intercession</b> avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, it is evident that the inclusion of the verse regarding the 'intercession of angels' lacks any relevance to the surrounding verses. It is out of place and fails to contribute any logical or meaningful connection to the context of the preceding or subsequent verses.</p>
<p>However, if we accept that the incident of Satanic Verses indeed happened (as mentioned in those 50 Traditions), then verse 26 immediately starts making perfect sense and perfect logic at this place, while the two abrogated/deleted Satanic Verses were talking about the "intercession" of pagan goddesses.</p>
<p>It proves that the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) revealed this new verse about the intercession of angels here in order to refute the Satanic Verses, which affirmed the intercession of pagan goddesses. </p>
<h2>Additional two verses about the same incident of Satanic Verses</h2>
<p>These two additional verses are as under:</p>
<p>The first verse is from Surah al-Hajj:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm">Surah Hajj 22:52</a>) And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '<strong>desires</strong><b>'</b>, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his <strong>desire</strong>, so God <b>'abrogates' </b>what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His <strong>verses precise again</strong> (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). And Allah is Knowing and Wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second verse is from Surah Bani Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;verse=73"> 17:73-75</a>) And indeed,<strong> </strong>they were about to<strong> tempt you away from that which We revealed</strong> to you in order to [make] you <strong>INVENT about Us something else (i.e. the Satanic Verses)</strong>; and then they would have taken you <strong>as a friend</strong>. And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little <strong>(i.e. Muhammad's DESIRE to reconciliate with them)</strong>. Then [if you had], We would have made you taste <b>double [punishment in] life and double [after] death</b>. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the verses mentioned above were revealed in response to the incident of the Satanic Verses. However, later Muslims dispersed these verses throughout different chapters of the Quran, intentionally preventing readers from finding them in one place to avoid raising questions about the incident of Satanic Verses.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId752021"></a>Why do Islamic apologists try to deny the connection between verse 22:52 of Surah al-Hajj and the incident of the Satanic Verses?</h3>
<p>Islamic apologists deny any <strong>link</strong> between these verses of Surah an-Najm and Surah al-Hajj as they deny the whole incident of Satanic Verses and those 50 Traditions about them. </p>
<p>However, Surah al-Hajj is a witness that indeed abrogation &amp; deletion (in the name of cleaning filth) of Quranic verses took place. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm">Surah Hajj 22:52</a>) And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>desires</strong></span><b>'</b>, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his <strong>desire</strong>, so God <b>'abrogates' </b>what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His <strong>verses precise again</strong> (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). And Allah is Knowing and Wise. <span>He (Allah) makes, what is thrown in by Shaitan (Satan), a </span><strong>Test</strong><span> for those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy and disbelief) and whose hearts are hardened.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, which were the verses which were abrogated and then deleted in the name of making the Quran precise again? </p>
<p>The 50 traditions are unanimous that it was Surah an-Najm, in which Satanic Verses were abrogated and then deleted for making the Quran precise again. Thus, these verses of Surah al-Hajj and Surah an-Najm are directly linked to each other and are about the same incident. </p>
<p>Therefore, if Islamic apologists today deny any link between these verses of Surah al-Hajj and Surah an-Najm, then they have to tell us: </p>
<ul>
<li>Which were those verses that were abrogated and then deleted.</li>
<li>And why were they abrogated and why were they deleted?</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, the occurrence of the word "DESIRE" ('<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29"><b> </b>tamannā</a><b> تمنی</b>') in both verses of Surah an-Najm and Surah al-Hajj also proves they are LINKED with each other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>(Suran an-Najm, Verse 24)</b> Or shall man have whatever he '<b>desires</b><b>' (Arabic:</b><a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29"><b> </b>tamannā</a><b> </b><b>تمنی</b><b>)</b></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><b>(<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm">Surah Hajj 22:52</a>)</b> And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '<b>desires</b>' <b>(Arabic:</b><a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29"><b> </b>tamannā</a><b> </b><b>تمنی</b><b>)</b>, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his desire (Arabic: <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:15%29">um'niyyatihi</a> أُمْنِيَّتِهِ), so God 'abrogates' what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His verses precise again (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, these Quranic Verses themselves prove that those 50 traditions are correct about the incident of Satanic Verses. </p>
<h3><span style="font-size: calc(1.3rem + 0.6vw); font-weight: bold;">Why are Islamic apologists compelled to deny the connection between verses </span><a href="https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;verse=73" style="font-size: calc(1.3rem + 0.6vw); font-weight: bold;">17:73-75</a><span style="font-size: calc(1.3rem + 0.6vw); font-weight: bold;"> of Surah Bani Israel and the incident of the Satanic Verses? </span></h3>
<p>Again, Islamic apologists are compelled to deny any link between verse <a href="https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;verse=73">17:73-75</a> of Surah Bani Israel and the incident of Satanic Verses. It is due to TWO mistakes that Muhammad made while composing this verse. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;verse=73"> 17:73-75</a>)</p>
<p>And indeed,<strong> </strong>they were about to<strong> tempt you away from that which We revealed</strong> to you in order to [make] you <strong>INVENT about Us something else (i.e. the Satanic Verses)</strong>; and then they would have taken you <strong>as a friend</strong>. And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little <strong>(i.e. Muhammad's DESIRE to reconciliate with them)</strong>. Then [if you had], We would have made you taste <b>double [punishment in] life and double [after] death</b>. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad sought to deflect the blame for the Satanic Verses away from Allah and onto himself. It was crucial to absolve Allah of any responsibility, emphasizing that Satan has no power over Allah and that He is infallible. Failure to do so could have jeopardized the foundation of the entire new religion of Muhammad. To strengthen his position, Muhammad revealed the subsequent verse, creating the impression that Allah was displeased with him for this mistake and even threatened him with double punishment.</p>
<p>Imam Syuti recorded the following tradition in his Tafsir under the verse 17:73 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;tSoraNo=17&amp;tAyahNo=73&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وأخرج ابن أبي حاتم عن محمد بن كعب القرظي رضي الله عنه قال: أنزل الله{ والنجم إذا هوى } [النجم: 1] فقرأ عليهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم هذه الآية{ أفرأيتم اللات والعزى } [النجم: 19] فألقى عليه الشيطان كلمتين: لك الغرانيق العلى، وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى. فقرأ النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ما بقي من السورة وسجد، فأنزل الله { وإن كادوا ليفتنونك عن الذي أوحينا إليك... } الآية. فما زال مغموماً مهموماً حتى أنزل الله تعالى{ وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي... } [الحج: 52] الآية.</p>
<p>Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurazi (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Allah revealed {By the star when it descends} [An-Najm: 1], and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) recited this verse to them: {Have you considered al-Lat and al-'Uzza?} [An-Najm: 19]. Satan then cast two phrases upon him: "These are the exalted cranes (idols), and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for." The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) recited the remainder of the surah and prostrated. Then Allah revealed {And indeed, they were about to tempt you away from that which We revealed to you...} [Al-Isra: 73]. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) remained in a state of grief and distress until Allah revealed {And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet...} [Al-Hajj: 52].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Islamic apologists deny it, as they cannot let this verse to be linked to the incident of Satanic Verses while Muhammad made two fatal mistakes in this verse.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The First Mistake: This verse claims that Muhammad could get double punishment for his "Unintentional" Mistake</strong></span></p>
<p>However, an important question arises: punishment is typically reserved for intentional mistakes. According to the Quran, Muhammad did not recite the Satanic Verses deliberately; he genuinely believed that Allah had fulfilled his desire, and Gabriel had brought those verses from Allah. If Allah had allowed Satan to misguide the prophet, why should the prophet be subjected to double punishment for an unintentional error?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Second Mistake: This verse claims it was not the Devil who misguided Muhammad for adding Satanic Verses, but it were Meccans who misguided Muhammad in doing it</strong></span></p>
<p>Look at the verse again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;verse=73"> 17:73-75</a>)</p>
<p>And indeed,<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;">they</span></span></strong> (i.e. Pagan Meccans) were about to<strong> tempt you away from that which We revealed</strong> to you in order to [make] you <strong>INVENT about Us something else (i.e. the Satanic Verses)</strong>; and then <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they</strong></span></span> would have taken you <strong>as a friend</strong>. And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>them</strong></span> a little <strong>(i.e. Muhammad's DESIRE to reconciliate with them)</strong>. Then [if you had], We would have made you taste <b>double [punishment in] life and double [after] death</b>. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad was only human and naturally prone to making such errors while composing the verses himself. He forgot that:</p>
<ul>
<li>He had already blamed the Devil for his misguidance.</li>
<li>And he had already claimed that he didn't <strong>INVENT</strong> anything <strong>intentionally</strong>, but it was the devil who inserted those 2 verses. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the next step, Islamic apologists fabricated seven different traditions to disconnect this verse from the incident of the Satanic Verses. However, as with all lies, contradictions emerged in all these 7 traditions, with each claiming a separate incident for the revelation of the same verse. </p>
<p>You can read these seven traditions <a href="https://www-altafsir-com.translate.goog/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;tSoraNo=17&amp;tAyahNo=73&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1&amp;_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">here</a>. </p>
<p>Logically, this verse was revealed in connection with only one incident. Moreover, the verse itself, with its references to temptation and inventing something new about Allah, fits the context of the Satanic Verses incident perfectly.</p>
<p>Islamists should be condemn for fabrication of thousands of such traditions. </p>

<p>حدثنا ابن حميد قال حدثنا سلمة قال حدثني محمد بن إسحاق عن يزيد بن زياد المدني عن محمد بن كعب القرظي قال لما رأى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم تولى قومه عنه وشق عليه ما يرى من مباعدتهم ما جاءهم به من الله <strong>تمنى </strong>في نفسه أن يأتيه من الله ما يقارب بينه وبين قومه وكان يسره مع حبه قومه وحرصه عليهم أن يلين له بعض ما قد غلظ عليه من أمرهم حتى حدث بذلك نفسه وتمناه وأحبه فأنزل الله عز وجل (والنجم إذا هوى ما ضل صاحبكم وما غوى وما ينطق عن الهوى - فلما انتهى إلى قوله - أفرأيتم اللات والعزى ومناة الثالثة الأخرى) ألقى الشيطان على لسانه لما كان يحدث به نفسه ويتمنى أن يأتي به قومه تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن ترتضي فلما سمعت قريش فرحوا وسرهم وأعجبهم ما ذكر به آلهتهم فأصاخوا له والمؤمنون مصدقون نبيهم فيما جاءهم به عن ربهم ولا يتهمونه على خطأ ولا وهم ولا زلل فلما انتهى إلى السجدة منها وختم السورة سجد فيها فسجد المسلمون بسجود نبيهم تصديقا لما جاء به واتباعا لامره وسجد من في المسجد من المشركين من قريش وغيرهم لما سمعوا من ذكر آلهتهم فلم يبق في المسجد مؤمن ولا كافر إلا سجد إلا الوليد بن المغيرة فإنه كان شيخا كبيرا فلم يستطع السجود فاخذ بيده حفنة من البطحاء فسجد عليها ثم تفرق الناس من المسجد وخرجت قريش وقد سرهم ما سمعوا من ذكر آلهتهم يقولون قد ذكر محمد آلهتنا بأحسن الذكر قد زعم فيما يتلو إنها الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن ترتضي وبلغت السجدة من بأرض الحبشة من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وقيل أسلمت قريش فنهض منهم رجال وتخلف آخرون وآتى جبريل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال يا محمد ماذا صنعت لقد تلوت على الناس ما لم آتك به عن الله عز وجل وقلت ما لم يقل لك فحزن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم عند ذلك حزنا شديدا وخاف من الله خوفا كثيرا فأنزل الله عز وجل وكان به رحيما يعزيه ويخفض عليه الامر ويخبره أنه لم يك قبله نبي ولا رسول تمنى كما تمنى ولا أحب كما أحب الا والشيطان قد ألقى في أمنيته كما ألقى على لسانه صلى الله عليه وسلم فنسخ الله ما ألقى الشيطان وأحكم آبائه أي فإنما أنت كبعض الأنبياء والرسل فأنزل الله عز وجل (وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي إلا إذا تمنى ألقى الشيطان في أمنيته فينسخ الله ما يلقى الشيطان ثم يحكم الله آياته والله عليم حكيم) فاذهب الله عز وجل عن نبيه الحزن وآمنه من الذي كان يخاف ونسخ ما ألقى الشيطان على لسانه من ذكر آلهتهم إنها الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن ترتضي بقول الله عز وجل ذكر اللات والعزى ومناة الثلاثة الأخرى (ألكم الذكر وله الأنثى تلك إذا قسمة ضيزى) أي عوجاء (إن هي إلا أسماء سميتموها أنتم وآباؤكم - إلى قوله - لمن يشاء ويرضى) أي فكيف تنفع شفاعة آلهتكم عنده فلما جاء من الله ما نسخ ما كان الشيطان ألقى على لسان نبيه قالت قريش ندم محمد على ما ذكر من منزلة آلهتكم عند الله فغير ذلك وجاء بغيره وكان ذانك الحرفان اللذان ألقى الشيطان على لسان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قد وقعا في فم كل مشرك فازدادوا شرا إلى ما كانوا عليه وشدة على من أسلم </p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p>When the messenger of God saw how his tribe turned their backs on him and was grieved to see them shunning the message he had brought to them from God, he <b>desired</b><b> </b>from his soul<b> </b>that something would come to him from God which would reconcile him with his tribe. With his love for his tribe and his eagerness for their welfare it would have delighted him if some of the difficulties which they made for him could have been smoothed out, and he debated with himself and fervently desired such an outcome. Then God revealed:</p>
<p><b><i>(Surah an-Najm, verses 1 to 3)</i></b><i>'By the Star when it sets, your comrade does not err, nor is he deceived; nor does he speak out of (his own) desire...'</i></p>
<p> and when he came to the words:</p>
<p><b><i>(Surah an-Najm, verses 19 and 20)</i></b><i> Have you thought of al-Lat and al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other?</i></p>
<p>then Satan cast on his tongue, because of his inner debates and what he <b><i>desired</i></b> to bring to his people, the words:</p>
<p><b><i>(Satanic Verse 1) 'These are the high-flying cranes;</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>(Satanic Verse 2) verily their intercession is accepted with approval.</i></b> </p>
<p>When Quraysh heard this, they rejoiced and were happy and delighted at the way in which he spoke of their gods, and they listened to him, while the Muslims, having complete trust in their prophet in respect of the messages which he brought from God, did not suspect him of error, illusion, or mistake.</p>
<p>When he came to the prostration, having completed the surah an-Najm, he prostrated himself and the Muslims did likewise, following their prophet, trusting in the message which he had brought and following his example. Those polytheists of the Quraysh and others who were in the mosque likewise prostrated themselves because of the reference to their gods which they had heard, so that there was no one in the mosque, believer or unbeliever, who did not prostrate himself ... The Quraysh left delighted by the mention of their gods which they had heard, saying,'Muhammad has mentioned our gods in the most favorable way possible, stating in his recitation that they are the high-flying cranes and that their intercession is received with approval.'</p>
<p>...  Then (later) Gabriel came to the Messenger of God and said, 'Muhammad, what have you done? You have recited to the people that which I did not bring to you from God, and you have said that which was not said to you.' Then the messenger of God was much grieved and feared God greatly, but God sent down a revelation to him, for He was merciful to him, consoling him and making the matter light for him, informing him that there had never been a prophet or a messenger before him who <b><i>desired</i></b> as he desired and wished as he wished but that Satan had cast words into his recitation, as he had cast words on Muhammad's tongue. Then God canceled what Satan had thus cast, and established his verses by telling him that he was like other prophets and messengers, and revealed:</p>
<p><b><i>(Surah al-Hajj, verses 52 and 53)</i></b><i> And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '</i><b><i>desires' (Arabic: </i></b><a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29"><i>tamannā</i></a><b><i> تمنی)</i></b><i>, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his </i><b><i>desire (Arabic: </i></b><a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:15%29"><i>um'niyyatihi</i></a><b><i> أُمْنِيَّتِهِ)</i></b><i>, so God </i><b><i>'abrogates' </i></b><i>what the devil throws in، </i><i>then Allah makes His verses precise again</i><i>. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. </i></p>
<p>Thus, God removed the sorrow from his messenger, reassured him about that which he had feared and canceled the words which Satan had cast on his tongue, that their gods were the high-flying cranes whose intercession was accepted with approval. He now revealed, following the mention of 'al-Lat, al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other,' the words:</p>
<p><b><i>(Surah an-Najm, verses 21 to 26)</i></b><i> 'Are yours the males and his the females? That indeed was an unfair division! They are but names which you have named, you and your fathers ...to whom he wills and accepts ' </i></p>
<p>This means, how can the intercession of their gods avail with God?</p>
<p>When Muhammad brought a revelation from God canceling what Satan had cast on the tongue of His prophet, the Quraysh said,'Muhammad has repented of what he said concerning the position of your gods with God, and has altered it and brought something else.' Those two phrases which Satan had cast on the tongue of the Messenger of God were in the mouth of every polytheist, and they became even more ill-disposed and more violent in their persecution of those of them who had accepted Islam and followed the messenger of God.</p>

<p>Imam Suyuti recorded this incident from an "authentic" chain of narration (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220810224353/http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;tSoraNo=22&amp;tAyahNo=52&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=1&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>وأخرج ابن جرير وابن المنذر وابن أبي حاتم وابن مردويه بسند صحيح، عن سعيد بن جبير قال: قرأ رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بمكة النجم، فلما بلغ هذا الموضع { أفرأيتم اللات والعزى ومناة الثالثة الأخرى } ألقى الشيطان على لسانه تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى. قالوا: ما ذكر آلهتنا بخير قبل اليوم، فسجد وسجدوا، ثم جاءه جبريل بعد ذلك قال: اعرض عليَّ ما جئتك به. فلما بلغ: تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى. قال له جبريل: لم آتك بهذا؛ هذا من الشيطان فأنزل الله { وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي }.</blockquote>
<p>Translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imam Ibn Jarir and others recorded through 'Sahih' (authentic) chain of narration from Saeed Ibn Jubayr that the prophet started reciting Surah Najam in Mecca. When he came to verse (<i>Have you thought upon al-Lat and al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other?</i>), then the devil threw (<i>alqa</i>) upon his tongue: “Those are the elevated cranes: truly their intercession is dearly hoped!”</p>
<p>Upon that the pagans said to Muhammad that he never before praised their idols. The Prophet prostrated and the pagans too prostrated along with him.</p>
<p>In the evening, Jibrael came and asked Muhammad to recite that which he earlier brought to him. When Muhammad recited the satanic verse, then Jibrael told him that he didn't bring that verse to him, but it was from the Satan. Thus, Allah revealed at that time: (Quran 22:52: And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he "<b>desires'' (Arabic: Tammana تمنی)</b>, the devil threw in his desire, so God erases what the devil throws in ...).</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId879075"></a>Criticism:</h2>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">
<p>This incident occurred five years after Muhammad had received prophethood. It raises the question of why Muhammad, after five years, did not possess knowledge about whether the pagan gods were false or true deities of high status.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<p>Even the Meccans (Quraysh) noticed this apparent "contradiction" in the revelations and began mocking Muhammad for it. It seems perplexing that Muhammad himself did not recognize the contradiction and immediately refute the so-called Satanic Verses.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<p>Furthermore, during the revelation of the verses, how was Satan able to influence Muhammad in the presence of Gabriel? Why didn't Gabriel intervene to prevent Satan's influence? According to Islam, only humans cannot see Satan, but angels are not oblivious to the devil's presence.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<p>Even if we assume that Gabriel was unable to see Satan, he could still hear what Muhammad was reciting to the gathering of pagans. Why didn't Gabriel warn Muhammad on the spot and prevent him from making such a grave mistake? Gabriel should have alerted Muhammad and rectified the situation before allowing him to leave the gathering of the Quraysh.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<p>What's even more perplexing is that when Gabriel later visited Muhammad, Gabriel seemed unaware that Satan had misled Muhammad in reciting the Satanic Verses or of what transpired during that gathering. Gabriel only became aware of the incident after instructing Muhammad to revise the verses that he brought to him earlier in the day.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<p>During the entire incident, Allah did not intervene and allowed Muhammad to praise the pagan gods. However, in the evening, Allah suddenly became active and immediately revealed the verses of Surah Hajj, comforting Muhammad by stating that all previous prophets had also been misguided by Satan due to their desires.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<p>But why would Allah allow Satan to misguide His messengers? Allah offers the excuse that it was a "<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>test</strong></span>." However, the question arises: a test for whom? If Muhammad himself was led astray, failed the test, and started believing that the pagan gods held high status, then how could anyone else have a chance to pass this so-called "test"? Therefore, all those present, including Muhammad, prostrated to the pagan gods, and even the Muslims failed to recognize and denounce the Satanic Verses. They all failed the test unanimously. Hence, even if we assume the existence of Allah, the question arises about the "wisdom" of Allah. Why would He conduct a test with a guaranteed 0% success rate when His own prophet fell victim to Satan's influence?</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Subsequently, Allah busied Himself with removing the contamination of the Satanic Verses from the Quran. And after deleting the Satanic Verses from the Quran, Allah boasts about himself that people should look at His power and that He has the ability to clean the filth. So, people should believe in Him.</li>
</ol>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>The recurring use of the excuse of a "<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>test</strong></span>" in the Quran is peculiar. Whenever the writer of the Quran faced unanswered questions, he resorted to this same excuse. For instance, when the Jews rejected Muhammad as a prophet of God, he became angry, and the writer of the Quran ordered a change in the Qibla direction (from Jerusalem to Mecca). When objections arose, the writer of the Quran once again invoked the excuse of a "test" to determine who would stand firm with Muhammad (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&amp;verse=143">Quran 2:143</a>). Even more perplexing is that not a single person, whether Muslim or hypocrite, abandoned Muhammad due to the change in Qibla. In this case, the success rate was 100%, with everyone passing the test, including the hypocrites. So, what was the purpose of such a test if everyone, including the hypocrites, would pass it? The reality is that this "test" is a feeble excuse, and the real reason for the change in Qibla was animosity towards the Jews. Please read all details here about this TEST:</p>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId970080"></a>Islamic Aqeedah (Belief): Even a 'donkey' is able to see Satan, but Prophet and Gabriel could not</h3>
<p>Islam asserts that even a humble creature like a donkey possesses the ability to perceive Satan's presence and alert others to it. However, it appears contradictory that Prophet Muhammad and Gabriel, who hold significant spiritual stature, were unable to see Satan. Consequently, Satan exerted dominance over both Muhammad and Gabriel, influencing the revelation.</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, Beginning of Creation (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/111">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet said, 'When you hear the crowing of cocks, ask for Allah's Blessings for (their crowing indicates that) they have seen an angel. And when you hear the braying of donkeys, seek Refuge with Allah from Satan for (their braying indicates) that they have seen a Satan.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another instance, the Prophet Muhammad expresses his strength by recounting an encounter in which he not only perceived Satan but also metaphorically symbolizes overpowering him, almost strangling him to the point of death.</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, Beginning of Creation (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/21/14">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, 'Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, Muhammad has a such high status that even a dream of a normal person becomes immune to Satan while the prophet Muhammad is present in his dream, but on the other hand, Muhammad was himself not immune to misguidance from Satan.</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, Book of Interpretations of Dreams (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/91/13">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet said, 'Whoever has seen me in a dream, then no doubt, he has seen me, for Satan cannot imitate my shape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, Muhammad holds such a high status that even the dreams of ordinary individuals become protected from Satan's influence when the Prophet Muhammad is present in those dreams. However, on the other hand, Muhammad himself was not immune to the potential misguidance from Satan.</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari, book of creation (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/96">Link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to Sham (and asked. 'Who is here?'), The people said, 'Abu Ad-Darda.' Abu Darda said, 'Is the person whom Allah has protected against Satan, (as Allah's Messenger said) amongst you'. The sub narrator, Mughira said that the person who was given Allah's Refuge through the tongue of the Prophet was `Ammar (bin Yasir).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here you can see the 'contradictions' in the so-called divine revelations, which will ultimately lead to only one conclusion that it was Muhammad who was himself making those revelations. </p>

<p>Muslims underwent three stages regarding the incident of the Satanic Verses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Period</strong>: During the initial 200 years, all Muslims universally accepted the incident of the Satanic Verses based on the teachings of the Quran and Traditions.</li>
<li><strong>Second Period</strong>: Following that, there was a period where some Muslims accepted the incident while others rejected it.</li>
<li><strong>Third Period</strong>: In the last 200 years, the majority of Muslims almost universally deny that the incident of the Satanic Verses ever occurred, also based on the teachings of the same Quran and Traditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>How did the perception of the Satanic Verses incident shift from being considered 100% true to being viewed as 100% false? What caused this transformation?</p>
<p>The problem arose when the "contradictions" in the "divine revelation" were exposed during the incident of the Satanic Verses. Despite presenting various excuses, Muslims were unable to conceal the human errors in those instances.</p>
<p>Another contributing factor was the emergence of the doctrine within the Muslim community that "Prophets are protected from being misguided by Satan." Mr. Shahab Ahmed clearly expressed this doctrine in the following words:</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the doctrines that emerged from the mid-2nd/8th century onwards was that of `ismat al-anbiya', literally the protection of the Prophets', meaning God's Protection of them from sin and error. The idea of the `ismah of the Prophets, which seems to have originated among the Shiah, was embraced as a doctrinal principle in some form or another by almost every Muslim sect and theological or legal school. With the spread of the concept that Muhammad constituted the model personality whose normative conduct (sunnah), as recorded in the klactith, was to be imitated by every Muslim, the idea that he should not sin must have appeared both logical and persuasive. Also, with the establishment of the legal principle that the Muslim community itself was protected from agreement upon error in the interpretation of Di-vine Law, it was hardly possible for the exemplar of the Law to be allowed to err himself.<br><br><strong>Reference</strong>: Ahmed, Shahab. “Ibn Taymiyyah and the Satanic Verses.” <i>Studia Islamica</i>, no. 87, 1998, pp. 67–124. <i>JSTOR</i>,<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1595926"> www.jstor.org/stable/1595926</a>. Accessed 8 June 2021.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, subsequent generations of Muslims were compelled to outright deny this incident in order to defend the honor of Islam. Consequently, they resorted to fabricating falsehoods and feeble excuses as a means to disavow it.</p>
<p>However, the predicament with fabrications is that they often contradict one another, necessitating the invention of numerous additional lies to conceal a single falsehood.</p>
<p>This same predicament befell the later generations of Muslims. Initially, they became divided into two groups, each refuting the other based on the teachings of the same Quran and Traditions.</p>
<p>The first group of Muslims outright denied the occurrence of this incident, asserting that there are no Quranic verses related to it, and all the traditions pertaining to this incident are weak. Therefore, they concluded that the incident never actually took place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the second group of Muslims accepted the occurrence of the incident but sought to preserve the honor of Islam through the employment of 'Taweel' (figurative interpretation in Arabic).</p>
<p>The second group found themselves compelled to refute the first group since this incident is indeed mentioned in the Quran itself and is supported by 'authentic' traditions transmitted through different chains of narration. Thus, denying its existence altogether became an untenable position.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId492278"></a>What led the Salaf, the early Muslim generations of the first 200 years, to unanimously assert that the Quran itself serves as evidence for the occurrence of the incident of the Satanic Verses?</h2>
<p>Ibn Taymiyyah, despite being an extremist Muslim and an apologist for Islam, wrote about this incident (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007100348/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?ID=611&amp;start=&amp;idfrom=1015&amp;idto=1019&amp;bookid=22&amp;Hashiya=5">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>والمأثور عن السلف <b>يوافق القرآن بذلك</b> ... وأما الذين قرروا ما نقل عن السلف فقالوا هذا منقول نقلا ثابتا لا يمكن القدح فيه<b> والقرآن يدل عليه</b> بقوله ۔۔۔</p>
<p>And what has been transmitted from the early generations of Salaf (i.e. this incident is authentic) <strong>aligns with the Quran in this matter</strong>... As for those who have affirmed what has been transmitted from the early generations, they have stated that it is a confirmed transmission that cannot be criticized, and the Quran proves it through its verses too...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the question is, why did the Salaf (early Muslims of the first 200 years) unanimously assert that the Quran itself serves as evidence for the occurrence of this incident? </p>
<p>The answer is, the presence of the words <strong>DESIRE</strong> and <strong>INTERCESSION</strong> in these verses of Surah an-Najam make it impossible to deny this incident. </p>
<p>Let us look at Suran an-Najm, Verse 53:19-26, once again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Verse 24) Or shall man have whatever he <strong>'desires' (Arabic:<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29"> tamannā</a> تمنی) </strong> <br>(Verse 25) To God belong the Last and the First.<br>(Verse 26) How many an angel is there in the heavens whose <strong>intercession</strong> avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already discussed above, how these verses become totally out of context with the proceeding and preceding verses. </p>
<p>However, if we interpret them within the context of the abrogated and deleted Satanic Verses and the entire incident surrounding them (where Muhammad "<strong>desired</strong>" reconciliation with the Meccans and accepted the "intercession" of pagan goddesses), then these 2 verses of Surah an-Najm immediately assumes a logical and meaningful position.</p>
<p>That is why Salaf Muslims of the first 200 years unanimously accepted the incident of Satanic Verses, while the Quran is itself a witness upon it. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId315979"></a>Even Sahih (authentic) Traditions also prove the occurrence of this incident</h2>
<p>Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani is considered to be one of the highest authorities upon Hadith by Muslims. He refuted the first group and wrote in his book “Fath-ul-Bari” (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;idto=8578&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=2515">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وكلها سوى طريق سعيد بن جبير إما ضعيف وإلا منقطع ، لكن كثرة الطرق تدل على أن للقصة أصلا ، مع أن لها طريقين آخرين مرسلين رجالهما على شرط الصحيحين أحدهما ما أخرجه الطبري من طريق يونس بن يزيد عن ابن شهاب حدثني أبو بكر بن عبد الرحمن بن الحارث بن هشام فذكر نحوه، والثاني ما أخرجه أيضا من طريق المعتمر بن سليمان وحماد بن سلمة فرقهما عن داود بن أبي هند عن أبي العالية ۔۔۔ ثم نقل تضعيف ابن العربي والقاضي عياض القصة ثم قال - : ۔۔۔ فإن الطرق إذا كثرت وتباينت مخارجها دل ذلك على أن لها أصلا ، وقد ذكرت أن ثلاثة أسانيد منها على شرط الصحيح ، وهي مراسيل يَحتجُّ بمثلها مَن يحتجُّ بالمرسل ، وكذا من لا يحتج به ، لاعتضاد بعضها ببعض ۔۔</p>
<p>All the paths of this hadith are either weak or cut off, except for that of Sa`id ibn Jubayr… However, the profusion of the chains show that the story has a basis, furthermore, there are two other “mursal” chains whose narrators are those of Bukhari and Muslim. The first one is that narrated by al-Tabari through Yunus ibn Yazid from Ibn Shihab [al-Zuhri]: “Abu Bakr ibn `Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham narrated to me,” etc. The second is what al-Tabari also narrated through al-Mu`tamir ibn Sulayman and Hammad ibn Salama from Dawud ibn Abi Hind from Abu al-`Aliya…. Contrary to what Abu Bakr ibn al-`Arabi and al-Qadi `Iyad have claimed whereby the story has no basis at all…. When the paths of a hadith are many and distinct, it shows that the report has a basis…. So, as I said, there are three sound but ‘<em>mursal</em>‘ chains for it, among them what meets the criteria of the two Sahihs but for the fact that they are ‘<em>mursal</em>‘. These constitute proof for both those that accept ‘mursal’ reports as proofs and those that do not, due to the mutual strengthening of the chains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence from the Quran itself is so explicit that there is no need for additional traditions to confirm the occurrence of the Satanic Verses incident. </p>
<p>To shed light on the tactics and deceptions employed by some Muslims in the name of "Ilm-ul-Hadith" (Science of Hadith), we have provided a list of 50 Hadiths pertaining to this incident.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sahih Bukhari briefly mentions this incident twice, offering shorter versions that still substantiate its occurrence.</p>
<p>From companion Ibn Abbas in Sahih Bukhari (<a href="http://qaalarasulallah.com/hadithView.php?ID=1041">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Ibn `Abbas:</p>
<p>The Prophet prostrated while reciting An-Najm and with him prostrated the Muslims, the pagans, the jinns, and all human beings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from companion 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud in Sahih Bukhari (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211103073838/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1070">link</a>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:</p>
<p>The Prophet recited Surat an-Najm (103) at Mecca and prostrated while reciting it and those who were with him did the same except an old man who took a handful of small stones or earth and lifted it to his forehead and said, 'This is sufficient for me.' Later on, I saw him killed as a non-believer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Islamic apologists, in their attempt to refute the existence of the Satanic Verses incident, argued that these two traditions do not explicitly mention the Satanic Verses. However, this raises the question of why the pagans would prostrate alongside Muhammad and the Muslims if such an incident did not occur.</p>
<p>To address this, Islamic apologists put forward the following excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was the <strong>beauty</strong> of the Quran which made Pagans automatically fall down and to prostrate to Allah when they heard this verse: (<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=53&amp;verse=62">Suran an-Najm 53:62:</a> So prostrate to Allah and worship Him)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there is a flaw in this argument put forth by Islamic apologists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nowhere in these two traditions of Sahih Bukhari is it mentioned that the pagans prostrated due to any perceived "beauty" of the Quran.</li>
<li>The Quran mentioned prostration to Allah in several places in the Quran, but pagans never prostrated upon them.  Does this imply that the remaining verses of the Quran lack any beauty that the pagans didn't prostrate there?</li>
<li>Furthermore, the preceding verses of the verse of prostration in Surah An-Najm (53:62) actually present a contrasting narrative, i.e. (1) The pagans of Mecca were mocking the Quran, (2) They were playing around with the Quran, and (3) To them, the Quran was not beautiful at all, but rather filled with falsehoods.</li>
</ul>
<p>How could then the pagans prostrate with Muhammad and other Muslims after hearing it? Just read these verses yourself which are witness of mocking of the Quran by pagans. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=53&amp;verse=59">Suran an-Najm, verses 59 to 62</a>) Do you then wonder at this recital (the Quran)? And you laugh at it and weep not, while ye amuse yourselves (while playing games with it)? So, prostrate to Allah and worship [Him].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the preceding verses of the Quran contradict the arguments put forth by Islamic apologists, and it becomes clear that if the pagans prostrated alongside Muhammad, it was undoubtedly due to the occurrence of the Satanic Verses incident. This indicates that Muhammad did indeed praise their goddesses, leading the Meccan pagans to also prostrate alongside him.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId860971"></a>The second group attempted to alter the interpretation of the incident of the Satanic Verses by employing various "Taweels" (i.e., figurative interpretations)</h2>
<p>The second group of Muslims acknowledged the occurrence of the incident of the Satanic Verses based on Quranic verses and numerous traditions. However, they attempted to dismiss it by resorting to "Taweel" (تأويل), which is a figurative interpretation.</p>
<p>In reality, Taweel is nothing more than a feeble excuse that lacks substantiation and is merely based on conjecture. Furthermore, Taweel is not aligned with the principles of justice; rather, it is a means of deceiving and undermining justice. Unfortunately, many Muslims still rely on Taweel to protect the reputation of their religion.</p>
<p>Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani belonged to this second group and documented the various Taweels concocted by Muslims to defend the honour of Islam.</p>
<p>To begin with, Ibn Hajar accepted this incident based on multiple traditions. He writes (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;idto=8578&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=2515">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>

The first one is that narrated by al-Tabari through Yunus ibn Yazid from Ibn Shihab [al-Zuhri]: “Abu Bakr ibn `Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham narrated to me,” etc. The second is what al-Tabari also narrated through al-Mu`tamir ibn Sulayman and Hammad ibn Salama from Dawud ibn Abi Hind from Abu al-`Aliya….

These constitute proof for both those that accept ‘mursal’ reports as proofs and those that do not, due to the mutual strengthening of the chains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Ibn Hajar argued the necessity of presenting Taweel, in order to save the honour of Islam. He continues (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;idto=8578&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=2515">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p> وإذا تقرر ذلك تعين تأويل ما وقع فيها مما يستنكر وهو قوله : " ألقى الشيطان على لسانه : تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى " فإن ذلك لا يجوز حمله على ظاهره لأنه يستحيل عليه - صلى الله عليه وسلم - أن يزيد في القرآن عمدا ما ليس منه ، وكذا سهوا</p>
<p>This said, it is required to interpret the incident (i.e. to do TAWEEL) and address what appears to be reprehensible, namely the statement 'the devil interjected the Satanic Verses upon the Prophet's tongue (i.e. "Those pagan goddesses are the elevated cranes: truly their intercession is dearly hoped). Such a thing is precluded from being accepted in literal terms for it is impossible for the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - to add something to the Qur'an that does not belong to it whether deliberately (`amdan) <strong>or erroneously (sahwan)</strong>. ..</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Response:</b> </p>
<p>We disagree with Ibn Hajar's reasoning. "Justice" entails accepting facts and evidence as they are, without altering them for the sake of preserving the honour of religion and the Prophet.</p>
<p>This so-called Taweel (i.e., figurative interpretation) is essentially an act that undermines justice by relying on conjecture.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId123582"></a>The First Taweel: Prophet praised pagan gods in those 2 Verses only in order to ridicule them</h3>
<p>Then Ibn Hajar presented the first Taweel that the Prophet actually uttered the praise of pagan goddesses in order to ridicule them (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;idto=8578&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=2515">link</a>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p> وقد رد ذلك عياض فأجاد . وقيل لعله قالها توبيخا للكفار ، قال عياض . وهذا جائز إذا كانت هناك قرينة تدل على المراد . ولا سيما وقد كان الكلام في ذلك الوقت في الصلاة جائزا - وإلى هذا نحا الباقلاني . </p>
<p>Al-Qadi `Iyad did well when he said: 'It is possible the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - was mentioning the belief of the pagans <strong>by way of derision</strong>, noting that at that time it was permitted to speak in the midst of prayer. To this position leaned Ibn al-Baqillani.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Answer:</b> </p>
<p>This conjecture has no weight if it were a mockery of the pagan gods, the pagans would not have prostrated along with Muhammad and other Muslims.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId717388"></a>Second Taweel: It was not the Prophet, but Pagans themselves uttered those 2 Verses</h3>
<p>Then Ibn Hajar presented the second Taweel that it was not the prophet, but the Pagans themselves, who uttered those 2 Satanic Verses. He wrote (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;idto=8578&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=2515">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وقيل إنه لما وصل إلى قوله : <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;idto=8578&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=2515#docu">ومناة الثالثة الأخرى </a>خشي المشركون أن يأتي بعدها بشيء يذم آلهتهم به فبادروا إلى ذلك الكلام فخلطوه في تلاوة النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - على عادتهم في قولهم . <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;idto=8578&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=2515#docu">لا تسمعوا لهذا القرآن والغوا فيه </a>ونسب ذلك للشيطان لكونه الحامل لهم على ذلك ، أو المراد بالشيطان شيطان الإنس</p>
<p>It was also said that when he reached the words {Have ye thought upon Al Lat and Al Uzza? And Manat, the third, the other?} the pagans feared lest he would add something to mock their gods, so they hastened to interject and jeer so as to cover up what was coming next, as was their habit stated in the verse { And those who disbelieve say: 'Listen not to this Quran, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome.'} (41:26). This act on their part was attributed to the devil as it was he that inspired it to them. Or, what was meant by the devil was the devil of humankind (i.e. it were Pagans themselves who uttered those Satanic Verses)....</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Our Response:</b> </p>
<p>Once again, it is evident that this figurative interpretation (Taweel) is solely based on conjecture, contradicting both the Quran and the 50 traditions that discuss this incident. The Quran does not mention any noise made by the pagans, but rather emphasizes the "desire" of the Prophet and Satan's influence in inserting the Satanic verses into his desire. Subsequently, Allah expresses anger towards the Prophet, threatens him with double punishment, and ultimately abrogates those verses.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId110935"></a>Third Taweel: The Prophet was neither misled by Satan nor he uttered those 2 Verses, but it was Satan who directly spoke those 2 verses in the voice of the prophet</h3>
<p>Then Ibn Hajar presented the third Taweel, that it was Satan who spoke those Satanic Verses in the voice of the Prophet (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;idto=8578&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=2515">link</a>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>وقيل : كان النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - يرتل القرآن فارتصده الشيطان في سكتة من السكتات ونطق بتلك الكلمات محاكيا نغمته بحيث سمعه من دنا إليه فظنها من قوله وأشاعها . قال : وهذا أحسن الوجوه<b> .</b></p>
<p>It was also said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was reciting the Quran with measured recitation. During one of the pauses, Satan seized the opportunity and uttered those words, imitating the Prophet's tone in such a way that those who were nearby heard it and thought it was from the Prophet. They then spread it as if it were his words. This, it is said, is the best of the interpretations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Our Response:</b> </p>
<p>Once again, how can this conjecture be accepted when the Quran is so clear that indeed Muhammad was mislead due to this DESIRE? </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId939635"></a>Fourth Taweel: The meaning of 'Tamana تمني' in this verse is not '<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);">desire</span>', but it means '<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">RECITATION</span>'</h3>
<p>Then Ibn Hajar mentioned another excuse that the meaning of 'Tamana تمني' does not only '<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>to desire</strong></span>', but it also has another meaning of '<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>to recite</strong></span>' (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;idto=8578&amp;bk_no=52&amp;ID=2515">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>قال : ومعنى قوله : في أمنيته أي في تلاوته ، فأخبر تعالى في هذه الآية أن سنته في رسله إذا قالوا قولا زاد الشيطان فيه من قبل نفسه ، فهذا نص في أن الشيطان زاده في قول النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - لا أن النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - قاله قال : وقد سبق إلى ذلك الطبري لجلالة قدره وسعة علمه وشدة ساعده في النظر فصوب على هذا المعنى وحوم عليه .</p>
<p>'The meaning of 'omniyyatihi' in verse 52 (of Surah al-Hajj) is '<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><b><i>recitation</i></b></span>'. Allah Almighty therefore informed us in this verse that His establish practice with His messengers is that if they (i.e. messengers) recite something, Satan adds to it this recitation from himself. This is a clear proof that Satan added something to what the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, not that the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself said it (due to his desire).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Response</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Islamic apologists soon realised that till the time the word 'Desire تمني' (i.e. the prophet got mislead due to his desire) is present in the Quran, they have no chance to defend the prophet by making any excuse/conjecture/Taweel.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the next step, they altogether changed the meaning of 'Tamana تمني' from '<span style="color: rgb(28, 0, 254);"><strong>desire</strong></span>' to '<span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>recitation</strong></span>'. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The word <span>تَمَنَّىٰ is a verb, while أُمْنِيَّتِهِ is a noun, and both mean 'to desire'. However, Islamic apologists changed both to 'to recite'.</span></p>
<p><span>Dear Readers!</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The correct translation of the word<span> 'تمني'</span><span> </span>is indeed "desire".</li>
<li>While the translation of "<strong>recitation</strong>" is indeed false and it was fabricated by some later Muslim scholars to defend the incident of Satanic Verses. It is indeed shameful that many Muslim Scholars propagated this falsehood, which goes against honesty. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proof 1: </strong></p>
<p><span>Even many Muslim Translators didn't accept this falsehood and translated it correctly (i.e. they used the word 'desire' instead of 'recitation'). </span><span>We invite people to go this </span><a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a
  
  
  
  
  underline
  " href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">page</a><span>, which has about 70+ translations of this Verse. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Proof 2</strong>:</span></p>
<p>As discussed earlier, both these verses in Surah an-Najm and Surah al-Hajj pertain to the same incident of Satanic Verses. In verse 24 of Surah an-Najm, the meaning of 'Tamana تمني' clearly indicates 'desire'. Therefore, it is logical to interpret the usage of 'Tamana تمني' in verse 52 of Surah al-Hajj in the same context of 'desire'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Surah al-Najm, Verse 24) Or shall man have whatever he '<b><i>desires</i></b>' (Arabic:<b><i> tamannā</i></b> تمنی)  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Proof 3</strong>: </p>
<p>All 50 traditions about the incident of Satanic Verses are unanimously telling that the prophet indeed got mislead due to his 'desire'. How can you neglect all these traditions, and then change the meaning of (<b><i>tamannā</i></b> تمنی) only based upon your conjecture? </p>
<p><strong>Proof 4</strong>:</p>
<p>There is no evidence in the whole Arabic literature (pre-Islamic, in the Quran &amp; Hadith, and even after Islam) that the term 'Tamana تمني' also means 'recitation'. </p>
<p>However, there is only a <strong>SINGLE</strong> instance in the <strong>whole</strong> history of Arabic Literature, where it has been claimed that it could also mean "recitation". It was a poem attributed to Hassan Ibn Thabit where the word 'Tamana تمني' is claimed to be used to mean recitation. However, even this single occasion is also DOUBTFUL as this narration is weak. </p>
<p>Muslim Scholar Ibn Aashoor writes in his book "al-Tahrir wa al-Tanwir" (<a href="https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/22/53">link</a>):</p>

<p> وقَدْ فَسَّرَ كَثِيرٌ مِنَ المُفَسِّرِينَ (تَمَنّى) بِمَعْنى قَرَأ. وتَبِعَهم أصْحابُ كُتُبِ اللُّغَةِ وذَكَرُوا بَيْتًا نَسَبُوهُ إلى<span> </span><strong>حَسّانَ بْنِ ثابِتٍ وذَكَرُوا قِصَّةً بِرِواياتٍ ضَعِيفَةٍ سَنَذْكُرُها ...</strong> وعِنْدِي في صِحَّةِ إطْلاقِ لَفْظِ الأُمْنِيَّةِ عَلى القِراءَةِ شَكٌّ عَظِيمٌ، فَإنَّهُ وإنْ كانَ قَدْ ورَدَ تَمَنّى بِمَعْنى قَرَأ في بَيْتٍ<span> </span><strong>نُسِبَ إلى حَسّانَ بْنِ ثابِتٍ إنْ صَحَّتْ رِوايَةُ البَيْتِ عَنْ حَسّانَ </strong>... <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">فَلا أظُنُّ أنَّ القِراءَةَ يُقالُ لَها أُمْنِيَّةٌ.</strong></p>
<p>Many interpreters have explained 'tamanā' (تَمَنَّى) as meaning 'read.' This interpretation is followed by scholars of the Arabic language, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>who have cited a poem attributed to Hassan ibn Thabit and mentioned a story <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;">with weak chains of narration</span></strong></span> that we will discuss ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Personally, I have significant doubts about the accuracy of using the term 'amnīyah' (أُمْنِيَّة) to refer to 'recitation,'</strong></span> despite the fact that the term 'tamanā' has been used in a verse attributed to Hassan ibn Thabit ... <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>I do not believe that 'recitation' should be referred to as 'amnīyah</strong></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then Ibn Aashoor furhter wrote (<a href="https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/22/53">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>عَمُوا أنَّ (تَمَنّى) بِمَعْنى: قَرَأ، والأُمْنِيَّةُ: القِراءَةُ، وهو ادِّعاءٌ لا يُوثَقُ بِهِ ولا يُوجَدُ لَهُ شاهِدٌ صَرِيحٌ في كَلامِ العَرَبِ. وأنْشَدُوا بَيْتًا لِحَسّانَ بْنِ ثابِتٍ في رِثاءِ عُثْمانَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ: </span></p>
<p class="poetry">تَمَنّى كِتابَ اللَّهِ أوَّلَ لَيْلِهِ ∗∗∗ وآخِرَهُ لاقى حِمامَ المَقادِرِ</p>
<p><span>وهُوَ مُحْتَمَلٌ أنَّ مَعْناهُ تَمَنّى أنْ يَقْرَأ القُرْآنَ في أوَّلِ اللَّيْلِ عَلى عادَتِهِ فَلَمْ يَتَمَكَّنْ مِن ذَلِكَ بِتَشْغِيبِ أهْلِ الحِصارِ عَلَيْهِ وقَتَلُوهُ آخِرَ اللَّيْلِ. ولِهَذا جَعَلَهُ تَمَنِّيًا لِأنَّهُ أحَبَّ ذَلِكَ فَلَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Translation:</strong></span></p>
<p>Some have claimed that 'tamanā' (تَمَنَّى) means 'to read,' and that 'amnīyah' (الأُمْنِيَّة) refers to 'recitation,' <strong>but this assertion is not reliable and lacks clear evidence in Arabic language usage</strong>. They have cited a verse attributed to Hassan ibn Thabit in praise of Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him):</p>
<p>تَمَنّى كِتابَ اللَّهِ أوَّلَ لَيْلِهِ ∗∗∗ وآخِرَهُ لاقى حِمامَ المَقادِرِ</p>
<p>But, this verse might also imply that he <strong>wished</strong> <strong>to read</strong> the Quran at the beginning of the night according to his practice, but was unable to do so due to the disturbance from the besiegers who killed him at the end of the night. Therefore, his <strong>wish</strong> was considered unfulfilled because he loved it but could not achieve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you able to see the double standards of Islamic apologists? They rejected the whole Arabic literature, which unanimously used 'tamanā' (تَمَنَّى) as 'desire'. Instead, they went without any proof for a 'singular' and a weak source, which claims that 'Tamana تمني' means 'recitation'. This is indeed dishonesty. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId965765"></a>Excuse by Modern Islamic apologists: Surah al-Hajj was revealed 8 years after Surah an-Najm</h2>
<p>Modern Islamic apologists also deny the existence of the incident of Satanic Verses on the basis of this argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surah al-Hajj was revealed 8 years after Surah an-Najm. How is it possible to accept that Allah will reveal verses about one incident 8 years after it? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Our Response</b>: </p>
<p>This argument holds no weight as it is widely known that the Quran is not arranged in chronological order. Each surah contains verses from various incidents that occurred at different times.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Quran is characterized by its lack of coherence to such an extent that within a single verse, one part may refer to one incident while the second part addresses a completely different incident that took place years apart.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>(<a href="https://quranx.com/5.3">Quran 5:3)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةُ وَٱلدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ ٱلْخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِۦ وَٱلْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَٱلْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَٱلْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَٱلنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ ٱلسَّبُعُ إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى ٱلنُّصُبِ وَأَن تَسْتَقْسِمُوا۟ بِٱلْأَزْلَٰمِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ ۗ ٱلْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن دِينِكُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَٱخْشَوْنِ ۚ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِى وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلْإِسْلَٰمَ دِينًا ۚ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ فِى مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لِّإِثْمٍ ۙ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1st part of the verse):</strong><br>Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, and the strangled (animal) and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression.</p>
<p><strong>(2nd part of the verse):</strong><br>This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion;</p>
<p><strong>(3rd part of the verse):</strong><br>but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the consensus of Quran commentators:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first segment of this verse pertains to the prohibition of certain foods, and it was revealed during the sixth year of the Hijri calendar, specifically during the time of the Hudaybiyyah Pact.</li>
<li>However, the second (middle) segment of this verse abruptly shifts its focus to the "Perfection of Religion," and this portion was revealed at a completely different time during the tenth year of the Hijri calendar. It is unrelated to the preceding segment of the verse.</li>
<li>The third and final segment of the verse returns to the initial incident regarding the prohibited foods, which was revealed during the Hudaybiyyah Pact in the sixth year of the Hijri calendar.</li>
</ul>
<p>In his Quranic commentary, Maulana Modoodi stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"According to authentic traditions, the second segment of the verse, which addresses the perfection of religion, was revealed during the 'Last Sermon' in the tenth year of the Hijri calendar. However, the initial segment of the verse pertains to the Hudaybiyyah Pact (which occurred in the sixth year of the Hijri calendar)."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId575198"></a>The initial verses of Surah an-Najm became a significant factor that later compelled Muslims to completely deny the incident of Satanic Verses.</h2>
<p>When Muhammad introduced his new religion and claimed to receive revelations from an Angel sent by God, the people of Mecca ridiculed him and accused him of being misled by Satan.</p>
<p>To counter this accusation, Muhammad recited Surah an-Najm in a gathering of Meccans, specifically the beginning verses of the Surah. In these verses, he vehemently denied being astray or misled, stating that his words were not driven by personal desire, but rather divine revelation taught to him by a mighty power.</p>
<p>The initial verses of this Surah are as under:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/53.1?context=5">Suran an-Najm, Verses 1 to 5</a>: </p>
<p>By the Star when it goes down,- Your Companion [Muhammad] is <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><b><i>neither astray nor being misled</i></b>. <b><i>Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire. It is naught but revelation that is revealed</i></b></span>, which one of mighty powers has taught him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, within the same Surah, Muhammad later affirmed the charge of being misled by Satan, acknowledging that he indeed went astray and got mislead and had mistakenly praised the pagan gods under Satan's influence. This admission contradicted the initial verses of Surah an-Najm.</p>
<p>This proves human error in what was presented by Muhammad as divine revelation. It opens the door to questioning the existence of Allah in the heavens and considering that Muhammad could have been the sole originator of these revelations, vulnerable to making human mistakes in their transmission.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>There is no divine Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad had to create Islamic laws on his own.</p>
<p>Since Muhammad was only a human and not well-educated, he made significant "Mathematical Mistakes" while distributing inheritance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your human intellect will clearly guide you to recognize that these Islamic rulings are ridiculous and lack wisdom.</p>
<p>As expected, it is only women who have to suffer due to these absurd rulings.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId604386"></a>(1) When SHARES make less than the Estate (An <a href="https://islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/133406/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AB">'Asbah عصبة</a> Case)</h2>
<p>For instance, let's consider a scenario where an individual passes away, leaving behind one daughter, parents, and wife. In such a case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The share of the daughter is 1/2 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“...and if there is only one daughter, then she shall have half the inheritance.” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.12">4:12</a>]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of shares in this case is calculated as follows: 1/2 for the daughter + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 0.96.</p>
<p>To illustrate, if the deceased left behind $1000, according to the Qur'an, the judge would only need to distribute $960 among the heirs, leaving $40 remaining.</p>
<p>When confronted with this mathematical error, Muhammad found it impossible to rectify. As a solution, he advised them to allocate the remaining portion of the estate to the nearest "male" relative <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(Source: </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/23/2">Sahih Muslim, 1615a</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">). This is known as </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/133406/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AB">'Asbah عصبة</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></p>
<p>While the remaining amount of $40 USD in this particular scenario may appear insignificant for the next male relative, little did Muhammad know that it would turn out to be a fatal mistake. This error resulted in Islamic rulings that are deemed ridiculous, illogical, and unjust towards women.</p>
<p>Allow me to provide a few examples to demonstrate the unjust nature of these inheritance laws, and your human intellect will naturally recognize their lack of wisdom.</p>
<p>Numerous online Islamic inheritance calculators are available. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://inheritance.ilmsummit.org/">Calculator 1</a> (A simple Islamic inheritance calculator).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.inheritance-calculator.com/">Calculator 2</a> (A detailed Islamic inheritance calculator)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please use any online calculator to verify the following examples. </p>
<p><strong>1st Example: Old Widow will get 25%, while a “MALE” relative (even a distant one like a cousin, or his son, or his grandson) will get 75% </strong></p>
<p>In the case where the deceased has no children but only a wife and a distant male relative (such as a cousin, or his son, or his grandson), the distribution of shares would be as follows:</p>
<p>The widow will receive 25% of the inheritance, while the "male" relative, regardless of their proximity, will receive the remaining 75%.</p>

<p>In the case of a wife who remains with her husband throughout her life, it may seem unjust that when she becomes a widow in her old age, she is entitled to only 25% of the inheritance. Meanwhile, the remaining 75% of the inheritance is awarded to a distant male relative, such as a cousin or any of his descendants, whom the deceased person may have never even encountered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this arrangement appear sensible to you?</li>
<li>Can you discern any divine wisdom in this particular Islamic law?</li>
<li>Do you believe that justice has been served to women by Muhammad/Allah in this regard?</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the opposite scenario does not hold true. If a woman passes away, her husband will inherit all her property, regardless of the presence of her closest relatives.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Example: Mother will get 33.33%, while distant relatives (like cousins, or his son, or his grandson) will get 66.67%</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, if the deceased person has an old mother and a distant male relative, the distribution of shares would be as follows:</p>
<table id="dgSharesIndiv" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 38.9892%; height: 136px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1" rules="all" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">

</table>
<p>Therefore, in this case, the old mother will receive only 33.33% of the inheritance, while a cousin (or his descendants, whom the deceased person may not have even encountered in his entire life) will receive 66.67%.</p>

<p><strong>3rd Example: Sister will get much more share in inheritance than the mother and the wife</strong></p>

<p>Despite the closer bond between a mother and her son, the illogical distribution of shares dictated by the Quran results in the sister receiving a larger inheritance portion than the mother (even if the sister is married).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the widow's share is even smaller than that of the mother, while the sister's share becomes even more substantial.</p>

<p>These inequitable and absurd divisions are a result of the illogical Islamic laws of inheritance, which lack any divine wisdom.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId375244"></a>(2) When SHARES make MORE than the Estate (An <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance">'Awl عول</a> Case)</h2>
<p>For instance, in the case where an individual passes away, leaving behind three daughters, parents, and wife, the distribution of inheritance would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The share of the three daughters is 2/3 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“...If (the heirs of the deceased are) more than two daughters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>]</em>.</li>
<li>And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: <em>“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.12">4:12</a>]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of shares in this scenario is calculated as 2/3 for the daughters + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 1.125.</p>
<p>In other words, if the deceased left behind 1000 dinars, according to the Quran, the judge would require 1125 dinars to distribute among the heirs, which exceeds the available amount.</p>
<p>Muhammad passed away without providing any solution to rectify this mathematical mistake in the Quran or Hadith.</p>
<p>Later, a similar case was presented to 'Umar Ibn Khattab, and he also found himself at a loss regarding what to do. However, someone suggested that he proportionally reduce the share of all heirs, and 'Umar adopted this "self-made" solution in an attempt to address the mathematical error in the Quran <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance">link</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">). </span></p>
<p>However, Ibn Abbas disagreed with 'Umar's approach, and Shia Muslims also have a differing perspective. They proposed an alternative "self-fabricated" solution (<a href="https://www.bzu.edu.pk/PJIR/vol10/eng%206%20Shahbaz%20Cheema%2004-11-13.pdf#page=9">link</a>).</p>

<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.11">4:11</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ</p>
<p> If (the heirs of the deceased are) <strong>more than two daughters</strong>, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allah is incorrectly using the phrase “<strong>more than two daughters</strong>” when He actually wanted to say “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”.</p>
<p>It is a clear linguistic mistake, and it happened while no Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own. </p>
<p>All Muslim Scholars agree that two daughters will get 2/3 of the estate.</p>
<p>Muhammad himself distributed 2/3rd of the estate between two daughters. </p>
<p>Sunan Tirmidhi, 2092:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The wife of Sa’d bin Rabi’ came with the two daughters of Sa’d to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, these are the two daughters of Sa’d. He was killed with you on the day of Uhud, and their paternal uncle has taken all that their father left behind, and a woman is only married for her wealth.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent until the Verse of inheritance was revealed to him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the brother of Sa’d bin Rabi’ and said: ‘Give the two daughters of Sa’d two thirds of his wealth, and give his wife on eighth, and take what is left.’”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is regrettable that certain modern Islamic apologists have deemed dishonesty permissible for themselves. They engage in distortions, concealment, and outright lies. However, the truth has a way of revealing itself despite their efforts.</p>
<div class="page-header">
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId307784"></a>(4) Kalalah كلالة: Contradictions in the Quran </h2>
</div>
<div class="icons">
<div class="float-end">
<p>Kalālah (Arabic: كلالة) is an Islamic inheritance term used to describe a deceased person who has an estate but lacks direct ascendants or descendants (meaning they have neither parents nor children).</p>
<p>The writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad himself), initially revealed the rulings on inheritance during the third year of the Hijri calendar after the battle of Uhud, which resulted in the death of 70 Muslims and the subsequent need to divide their inheritance. <span style="font-size: 1rem;"> (Please see the introduction of </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=4&amp;verse=1">Surah al-Nisa by Maududi</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">).</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="com-content-article__body">
<p>During that period in the third year of the Hijri calendar, the Quran prescribed the division of inheritance for a Kalalah individual (someone who has neither parents nor children) in the following manner:</p>
<p>Suran al-Nisa <a href="https://quranx.com/4.12">4:12</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>۔۔۔ وَإِن كَانَ رَجُلٌ يُورَثُ <strong>كَلاَلَةً</strong> أَوِ امْرَأَةٌ وَلَهُ أَخٌ أَوْ أُخْتٌ فَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا السُّدُسُ فَإِن كَانُواْ أَكْثَرَ مِن ذَلِكَ فَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ فِي الثُّلُثِ ۔۔</p>
<p>...  And if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth. But if they are more than two, they share a third ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, in the 3rd Hijri year, the distribution of inheritance for a Kalalah person included the following provisions for the share of brothers and sisters:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Kalalah person had only one brother or sister, their share was set at 1/6th of the estate.</li>
<li>In the case of multiple brothers and sisters, they would all receive equal portions from 1/3rd of the estate.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a complication arose six years later when, in the 9th Hijri year, the writer of the Quran (Muhammad himself) seemingly forgot this ruling and claimed a new revelation, altering the share of brothers and sisters for a Kalalah person. The revised distribution was as follows:</p>
<p>Surah al-Nisa, verse 176:</p>
<dl class="verse__translation arabic-container" data-translator-code="AR">
<dd class="arabic highlightable">يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِى <strong>ٱلْكَلَٰلَةِ</strong> ۚ إِنِ ٱمْرُؤٌا۟ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٌ وَلَهُۥٓ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ ۚ وَهُوَ يَرِثُهَآ إِن لَّمْ يَكُن لَّهَا وَلَدٌ ۚ فَإِن كَانَتَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُمَا ٱلثُّلُثَانِ مِمَّا تَرَكَ ۚ وَإِن كَانُوٓا۟ إِخْوَةً رِّجَالًا وَنِسَآءً فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ ۗ </dd>
<dd class="arabic highlightable">They request from you a [legal] ruling. Say, "Allah gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants [as heirs]." If a man dies, leaving no child but [only] a sister, she will have half of what he left. And he inherits from her if she [dies and] has no child. But if there are two sisters [or more], they will have two-thirds of what he left. If there are both brothers and sisters, the male will have the share of two females. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Hence, in the 9th Hijri year, the distribution of inheritance for a Kalalah person introduced the following shares for brothers and sisters:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single sister of a Kalalah person would receive half of the estate.</li>
<li>A single brother of a Kalalah person would inherit the entirety of the estate (i.e., twice the share of a sister).</li>
<li>If there are two or more sisters, the remaining two-thirds of the estate would be divided equally among them.</li>
<li>In the presence of both brothers and sisters, the entire estate would be divided in a manner where brothers receive double the share of sisters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, these two Quranic verses present a significant contradiction concerning the shares of brothers and sisters of a Kalalah person, causing confusion among Muslims.</p>
<p>Maududi wrote under the commentary of this verse of Surah al-Nisa 4:176 (<a href="https://islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=4&amp;verse=172&amp;to=176">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p> This verse was revealed long after the revelation of the rest of this surah. According to certain traditions, this verse was the very last Qur'anic verse to be revealed. (For these traditions, see Ibn Kathir's comments on this verse - Ed.) Even if this is disputed, it shows at least that this verse was revealed in 9 A.H., whereas the Muslims had been reciting the present surah, al-Nisa, for quite some time before that. It was for this reason that this verse was not included among the verses relating to inheritance mentioned at the beginning of the surah, but was attached to it at the end as an appendix (i.e. it is the last verse of Surah al-Nisa).</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId519254"></a>(5) Quranists (The Rejectors of Hadith) making their own new Quran</h2>
<p>Modern Quranists, who reject the authority of Hadith, also found themselves grappling with this mathematical error. As a result, they resorted to fabricating their own new Quran. They claimed that the wife's share, equivalent to 1/8 of the estate, should be allocated FIRST, and then the remaining portion should be distributed among the remaining heirs.Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wife will get <strong>FIRST</strong> the 1/8 of the whole estate.</li>
<li>And then from the remaining estate, parents will get 1/3, and daughters will get 2/3</li>
<li>This makes 1/3 of parents  + 2/3 of daughters = 1 </li>
</ul>
<p>They cite verse 4:33 as evidence to support their belief that the wife's share should be given priority and allocated first from the entire estate.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Let us examine verse <a href="https://quranx.com/4.33">4:33</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/4.33">4:33</a>) And for all We (have) made heirs of what (is) left (by) the parents and the relatives. And those whom pledged your right hands - then give them their share. Indeed, Allah is over every thing a Witness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowhere in this verse does it explicitly state that the wife should be given her share first from the entire estate. The idea of prioritizing the wife's share as the Quranists propose is a novel interpretation, similar to Umar Ibn Khattab's new solution of 'AWL or the different solution offered by Ibn Abbas/Shias. While this alternative may address the issue of inheritance, it does not resolve the underlying mathematical mistake in the Quran.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Quran claims that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its verses are "easy" to understand" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/54.17">54:17</a>)</li>
<li>Its verses are "clear", "manifest" and "guidance" (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2">27:1-2</a>)</li>
<li>It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/12.2">12:2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>But then according to modern Quranist standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Quranic claim appears to be contradicted here, as the companions (Sahaba) and the billions of Muslims over the past 14 centuries, who have diligently read and contemplated the same Quran, were allegedly misguided according to modern Quranists.  They were supposedly unable to comprehend that the Quran intends for the wife to be given her share first.</li>
<li>Thus, the Quran is deemed to be deceptive in its assertion of clarity and ease of understanding. This raises doubts about following such an ambiguous book that allegedly leads its billions of followers astray despite their unwavering faith and continuous contemplation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, there is no such solution present in the Hadith literature either, which suggests giving the wife her share first. In fact, Muhammad himself recognized the impracticality of dividing the entire estate according to the Quranic rulings and instructed to distribute the remainder to the next male relative. Throughout the 1400-year history of Islam, this solution suggested by modern Quranists today has been absent.</p>]]></description>

<p>Abdullah Ibn Sa'd embraced Islam during the time of Mecca and attained the esteemed status of being a Companion of Muhammad, which holds great importance in the Islamic faith. Subsequently, he rose to the position of the scribe of the Quran (كاتب الوحي), a position even higher than that of a Companion.</p>
<p>Under Muhammad's guidance, he transcribed the revelations as they were dictated to him. However, one day, an incident occurred that opened Abdullah Ibn Sa'd's eyes, leading him to realize that the revelations were not of divine origin but were being fabricated by Muhammad himself.</p>
<p>Upon this realization, Abdullah Ibn Sa'd renounced Islam and became an apostate.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translation:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This verse was revealed about 'Abd Allah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh. This man had declared his faith in Islam and so the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, called him one day to write something for him. When the verses regarding the believers were revealed (Verily, We created man from a product of wet earth…) [23:12-14], the Prophet dictated them to him. When he reached up to (and then produced it as another creation), 'Abd Allah expressed his amazement at the precision of man's creation <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">by saying (فتبارک اللّٰہ احسن الخالقین So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators!). The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: “This ['Abd Allah's last expression فتبارک اللّٰہ احسن الخالقین So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators!] is how it was revealed to me (so write them too in Quran)”.</strong> At that point, doubt crept into 'Abd Allah. He said: “If Muhammad is truthful, then I was inspired just as he was; and if he is lying, I have uttered exactly what he did utter”. Hence Allah's words (and who saith: I will reveal the like of that which Allah hath revealed). The man renounced Islam. <br>This is also the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas according to the report of al-Kalbi. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Abdan informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Nu'aym&gt; Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Umawi&gt; Ahmad ibn 'Abd al-Jabbar&gt; Yunus ibn Bukayr&gt; Muhammad ibn Ishaq&gt; Shurahbil ibn Sa'd who said: <br>“This verse was revealed about 'Abd Allah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh. The latter said: 'I will reveal the like of that which Allah has revealed', and renounced Islam. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, entered Mecca, this man fled to 'Uthman [ibn 'Affan] who was his milk brother. 'Uthman hid him until the people of Mecca felt safe. He then took him to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and secured an amnesty for him”.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These words of ‘Abdullah Ibn Abi al-Sarh {فتبارک اللّٰہ احسن الخالقین So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators!!} still exist in the Quran to this day. (Verse </span><a href="https://quranx.com/23.14"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23:14</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p>Did Ibn Abi al-Sarh falsely accuse Muhammad? Certainly not!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that Muhammad took possession of his words without taking care of any copyrights, and he forgot that he himself earlier challenged the pagans of Mecca, asserting that they could not produce a single verse like that of the Quran. </span></p>
<p>Therefore, Ibn Abi al-Sarh witnessed firsthand that Muhammad was fabricating revelations on his own, which made him aware of this falsehood. Nevertheless, he decided to further test Muhammad to confirm his doubts. Muslim historians such as Waqidi, Ibn Athir, and Tabari have written that when Muhammad dictated the phrase "Allah is All-Knowing All-Wise" (عليم حکيم) to him, Ibn Abi al-Sarh wrote it in the reverse order (i.e., "All-Wise All-Knowing" - حکيم عليم). He then recited it back to Muhammad, who did not detect these changes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waqidi recorded a comment by Ibn Abi al-Sarh (<a href="https://archive.org/details/kitab-maghazi-waqidi/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%20%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%20%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%20%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3%20%D8%AC%202/page/n441/mode/2up?q=%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%8A&amp;view=theater">link</a>):</span></p>

<p>"Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi Sarh used to write down the revelations for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Sometimes, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would dictate to him (for example) 'All-Hearing, All-Knowing,' and he would write 'All-Knowing, All-Wise.' The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would recite it and say, 'This is also from Allah,' and approve it. However, Abdullah became confused and said, 'Muhammad does not know what he is saying. I can write whatever I wish for him. What I have written is revealed to me just as it is revealed to Muhammad.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Ibn Abi al-Sarh renounced Islam, he told the people of Mecca, "Your religion is better than his." (دينكم خير من دينه) </span></p>
<p>Upon learning about it, Muhammad became furious with him, realizing that it would be nearly impossible to determine the exact locations where Ibn Abi al-Sarh had introduced distortions in the Quran.</p>
<p>In an attempt to discredit Ibn Abi al-Sarh, Muhammad accused him of being a liar and declared the revelation of the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quran </span><a href="https://quranx.com/6.93"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6:93</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ومن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا أو قال أوحي إلي ولم يوح إليه شيء ومن قال سأنزل مثل ما أنزل الله</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, "It has been inspired to me," while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, "I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad sought to defend himself against Ibn Abi al-Sarh's accusations. However, all of his excuses proved futile, and this verse now stands as undeniable evidence against him, especially for those discerning individuals who possess critical thinking abilities. We should express gratitude for this verse since, without it, Islam apologists would likely have dismissed the very existence of Abdullah Ibn Abi al-Sarh by deeming all traditions concerning him as "weak."</p>

So, when the Prophet dictated him: "Who heareth and knoweth all things", he'd write it: "All-Knowing, All-Wise". So, he doubted and reverted. Then he said, "If Mohammad gets inspiration, then I get inspiration too, and if Allah sent him his revelation, then I was sent the same thing. For when Mohammad said, 'Who heareth and knoweth all things' I'd say, 'All-Knowing, All-Wise'" So he followed the Pagans, and he blew the cover of Ammar and Jubar [secret Muslims] to Ibn Al-Hudrumi or to Bani Abd Al-Dar, so they took them and tortured them until they reverted. Ammar's ear was cut off that day, so he [Ammar] went to the Prophet (SAW) and told him what had happened to him, but the Prophet (SAW) refused to handle his issue. So, Allah revealed about [Abdullah] Ibn Abi Al-Sarh and his companions, "Anyone who, after accepting Faith in Allah, utters Unbelief, - except under compulsion, his heart remaining firm in Faith - but such as open their breast to Unbelief, on them is Wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a dreadful Penalty" Who was "under compulsion" is Ammar and his companions, and who "open their breast to Unbelief" is [Abdullah] Ibn Abi Al-Sarh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em>It shows the true nature of Mohammad. We have to admit that he was a very shrewd leader. He knew how to secure his alliances. Uthman was too important an ally for Mohammad to upset. He inwardly still wanted the scribe to be killed even though it was politically expedient for him to spare him. This was Mohammad's inner struggle that he wanted his followers to solve for him by killing the scribe without any trial. This would save face in front of Uthman as he could claim that he didn't want to kill him but some hothead follower did it anyway. His followers had the decency to not rush to judgement before their leader had made a clear call. Mohammad after accepting the scribe's pledge still bore enough enmity for him to ask his followers why they didn't kill him? They said they didn't get a sign. Mohammad told them that prophets can't make a treacherous signal with their eye. </em></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em>This excuse from Muhammad is ridiculous. It means only that prophets can be treacherous in their heart but making an outward sign is what he considers treachery. An outward sign of treachery would have alerted Uthman and that is what Mohammad couldn't risk. He wanted his followers to read his mind and the treacherous intentions of his heart. </em></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em>This is the man that 1.8 billion muslims follow. It shows how gullible they are. Then again they are never shown these hadiths or even if they are shown these hadiths they read them with the blindfolds of devotion on. </em></p>

<h3>Islamic Apologists: The tradition about Verses 23:12-14 is not correct </h3>
<p>We have previously presented the tradition regarding verses 23:12-14 (refer to Proof Nr. 1 above), which includes the words of Abdullah Ibn Sa'd as part of the Quran.</p>
<p>However, some Islam apologists (<a href="https://www.islamic-awareness.org/quran/sources/sarh/">link</a>) have argued that this tradition cannot be accurate because Surah Muminun (in which these verses 23:12-14 are found) was revealed during the Meccan period, while Abdullah Ibn Abi Sarh embraced Islam later in the Medinan period. As evidence, they cite the following tradition from the book "Asad-ul-Ghaba" by Ibn Athir (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211130144827/https://al-maktaba.org/book/1110/6110">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أسلم قبل الفتح، وهاجر إِلَى رَسُول اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وكان يكتب الوحي لرسول اللَّه صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ثم ارتد مشركًا، وصار إِلَى قريش بمكة<br>He (‘Abdullah Ibn S’ad Ibn abi Sarh) accepted Islam before the “Victory of Mecca”. He migrated to the Prophet (when he was already in Medina). He was a scribe of revelation, but later he apostated and went back to Quraysh in Mecca. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>During the early period of Islam, there was a widespread awareness of the truth behind various incidents that occurred during Muhammad's time and the corresponding revelations of Quranic verses. Consequently, many people accurately narrated traditions about these events.</p>
<p>However, some of these traditions painted Islam and Muhammad in a negative light, and later Muslims sought to preserve the honor of their religion by discrediting them. As a result, these later Muslims employed two strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>They fabricated numerous Ahadith (narrations) to counter the traditions that revealed the actual truth.</li>
<li>They developed the field of 'Ilm-ul-Hadith (Science of Hadith) and categorized certain traditions as 'weak' if they contradicted the honor of Islam.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite their efforts, these Muslim scholars and fabricators often made mistakes and were unable to concoct enough falsehoods to conceal the truth.</p>
<p>One specific case that exemplifies this situation is that of Ibn Abi Sarh:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tradition of Ibn Atheer, which claims that Ibn Abi Sarh accepted Islam during the period in Medina, is a solitary report without any chain of narration to support it.</li>
<li>Moreover, the revelation of Surah Muminun (Verses 23:12-14) took place in Mecca, contradicting the claim in Ibn Atheer's tradition.</li>
<li>Similarly, Surah al-Anam (Verse 6:93) was also revealed in Mecca, wherein Allah Himself testifies to the presence of a person claiming to have fabricated a revelation. This serves as irrefutable evidence that Abdullah Ibn Abi Sarh did indeed accept Islam during the Meccan period, and the incident of his apostasy occurred in Mecca.</li>
<li>Additionally, the traditions presented in proofs 3, 4, 5, and 6 also pertain to Surah al-Anam (Verse 6:93) and confirm that the incident involving Abdullah Ibn Abi Sarh occurred during the Meccan period.</li>
<li>Lastly, proof 4 mentions the torture of Ammar Yasir and his companions, a well-known event that unquestionably transpired during the Meccan period. Consequently, it further supports the notion that the incident involving Ibn Abi Sarh took place during the Meccan period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, these arguments highlight the "double standards" employed by apologists of Islam, who dismiss all these pieces of evidence while accepting the solitary report by Ibn Athir, which not only contradicts other traditions but also goes against the Quranic text.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Islamic Apologists: It was not Ibn Abi Sarh, but a Christian man who used to claim to add to the Quran</h2>
<p>Islamic apologists bring the following tradition to deny Ibn Abi Sarh's role:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3617">Sahih al-Bukhari 3617</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Anas: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-`Imran, and he used to <strong>write (the revelations)</strong> for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: "<strong>Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.</strong>" Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, "This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them." They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, "This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them." They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p>Firstly, this is a "singular" tradition which has no other chain of narration. And we already know that later coming Muslim generations were masters of FABRICATING false Ahadith to safeguard their religion. Please read our article: </p>
<ul>
<li><a class="mod-articles-category-title " href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/hadith/114-the-fabrication-of-ahadith-in-order-to-save-the-honor-of-islam">The Hadith Fabrication Factory of Muslims: 131 Traditions claimed it was Ishaaq who was slaughtered, while 133 Traditions were fabricated that claimed it was Ismael who was slaughtered</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, even this hadith also proves that a companion of Muhammad, who was also a "<strong>Scribe</strong> of the Quran", left Islam and became Christian again. This is in itself a question mark upon the so-called linguistic miracle of the Quran. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId961194"></a>Summary:</h2>
<p>It is unfortunate that in the incident of IFK, the Most Important issues never come to light, which totally EXPOSE Muhammad.</p>
<p><span>Muhammad wanted his followers to stop DOUBTING Aisha, as it was alo a threat to his claim of prophethood. </span>Thus, <strong>after one month</strong> of the IFK incident, Muhammad claimed the revelation of the fowlling verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer
  
  
  
  
  underline
  " href="https://quranx.com/24.12?context=4" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Quran 24:12-16</a>:</p>
<p>Why did the <strong>faithful</strong> men and women <b><span style="color: #e67e23;">not (immediately) think well of their people</span> (i.e. 'Aisha and Safwan)</b> when they heard this, and said: <b>"<span style="color: #843fa1;">This is a clear lie?</span>"</b> ... Why did you not say as soon as you heard it: <b>"<span style="color: #169179;">It is not for us to speak of it</span>? God preserve us, <span style="color: #e03e2d;">it is a great slander!</span>"</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>However, according to Aisha's testimony in <a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer
  
  
  
  
  underline
  " href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Sahih Bukhari 4141</a>, Muhammad's behavior diverged from these expectations:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>He doubted Aisha immediately</span></li>
<li><span>He did not declare it a lie</span></li>
<li><span>He discussed the matter with others</span></li>
<li><span>He did not immediately denounce it as slander</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The<span> </span><a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer
  
  
  
  
  underline
  " href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Sahih Bukhari 4141</a><span> </span>is a long Hadith, where 'Aisha is giving stunning details about the incident of IFK and what happened during the next one month.</p>
<p>According to the testimony of 'Aisha in this Hadith, the CLASH between the Quran and Muhammad's Actions was even wider than that. 'Aisha testified that during this one-month period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad immediately began to <strong>DOUBT</strong> 'Aisha.</li>
<li>Muhammad's <strong>kindness</strong> towards 'Aisha diminished, even when she was ill. He would only greet her and then leave.</li>
<li>Muhammad <strong>initiated investigations</strong> into 'Aisha's character, seeking information from Ali, Zayd (the adopted son), and Barira (the maid-servant) within his home.</li>
<li>He consulted Ali about the possibility of <strong>DIVORCING</strong> 'Aisha.</li>
<li>Even after one month, Muhammad continued to doubt 'Aisha, <strong>asking her to confess and repent</strong> if she had committed a sin.</li>
<li>'Aisha expressed deep disappointment with Muhammad's behavior, to the extent that <strong>she refused to engage in direct conversation with him</strong>.</li>
<li>She also <strong>refused to testify</strong> her innocence to Muhammad, believing that he had already been influenced by planted slander and would not accept her testimony.</li>
<li>'Aisha further explained that if she were to falsely confess to the sin, Muhammad would readily believe it.</li>
<li>'Aisha <strong>turned her face away from Muhammad</strong> and laid on the other side of the bed.</li>
<li>Despite Muhammad claiming divine revelation that proved 'Aisha's innocence, <strong>she remained upset with Muhammad's behavior.</strong> When her mother asked her to accompany Muhammad, <strong>'Aisha refused to go with him</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a logical perspective, it becomes apparent that Muhammad used the revelation to reprimand others for the very actions he himself had committed. In reality, Muhammad's behaviour inflicted the greatest pain on 'Aisha, surpassing the actions of any other individual.</p>
<p>Here are some of the important parts of this Hadith (with our comments to make it easy for people to undersand):</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">[Muhammad doubted 'Aisha's Charter]:</span></strong></em></p>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: ... "After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers <b>while I was unaware of anything of all that,</b> <b>but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and leave</b>.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">[Muhammad started consulting 'Ali about divorcing 'Aisha]:</span></strong></em></p>
<p>... ('Aisha further said) When the Divine Inspiration was delayed, <b>Allah's Messenger called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me ... </b>(Muhammad then also asked Barira, the maid-servant about 'Aisha's charater) and Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">[Muhammad kept on doubting 'Aisha till the end ... i.e. even after ony month]:</span></strong></em></p>
<p>... ('Aisha further said that she went to her parents' house, while she was disturbed from those rumors and from Muhammad's behavior. Then after one month) Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. <b>He had never sat with me since that day of the slander.</b> <b>A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.</b> Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-and so about you; <b>if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'</b></p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">[It was Muhammad, who probably caused most pain to 'Aisha with his attitude of doubting her]</span></strong></em></p>
<p>... ('Aisha further said) Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger .' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, <b>'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth.

Allah has declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger). I replied, <b>'By Allah, I will not go to him,</b> and I praise none but Allah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The discrepancies between Quranic verses and Muhammad's reported behaviour in the Ifk incident are evident. However, this raises an important <strong>OBJECTION</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Muslim Objection:</strong> Non-Muslims believe that the Quran and Muhammad are one and the same (i.e., Muhammad himself was creating the revelations). How, then, can such a clash occur between the Quran and Muhammad's actions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our Response:</strong> This clash occurred due to Muhammad's <strong>DOUBLE behaviour</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Public Behaviour (outside the house):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Muhammad tried to save Aisha from slander</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was partly to protect his claim of Prophethood. It was INDIRECTLY challenging his claim of Prophethood as people were making FUN of him for not being able to control his wife</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private Behaviour (inside the house):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inside the house, Muhammad was fully doubtful about Aisha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He consulted Ali about divorcing her</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Muhammad likely assumed people would not learn about his private actions. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aisha later exposed the inside story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This revealed Muhammad's contradictory behaviours</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This dual behavior ultimately led to the apparent clash between Quranic Verses (which were meant ONLY for Public) and Muhammad's actions (inside the house).</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During an expedition, the Muslim caravan accidentally left 'Aisha behind at the camp. Safwan, a companion of Muhammad, later found her in the camp and they spent the night there. The next day, Safwan brought 'Aisha back to Muhammad. However, rumours began to circulate, accusing 'Aisha and Safwan of committing adultery. This incident, known as the IFK, posed a danger to Muhammad and indirectly affected his claim of prophethood. Despite having multiple wives and slave women, Muhammad remained childless.  </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">After almost one month, Muhammad made his first public appearance (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4757">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4757</a>), where:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">He declared it (even without any revelation) to be a "<strong>forged story</strong>", by making an <strong>'<em>argument</em>' that he never saw anything bad in the character of 'Aisha or Safwan even before this incident. </strong></li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And then he commanded Muslims to kill 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai, who used this incident to question Muhammad's prophethood. Nevertheless, the people of 'Abdullah's tribe refused to obey Muhammad, and they defended him. The two tribes of Muslims almost started a fight upon it. Thus, Muhammad failed to kill him.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Moreover, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai was not alone. In fact, almost all Sahaba were doubtful about 'Aisha, which was making them doubtful about Muhammad's prophethood too indirectly. </li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Please note that in that first public appearance (which happened one month after the incident of Ifk), the declaration of 'Aisha's and Safwan's innocence was not even dependent upon any revelation, but it was dependent upon a simple argument, which he had already known even before this incident (i.e. there was nothing wrong in their characters).<strong> So, why did Muhammad wait for one month for this first public appearance in order to claim 'Aisha's innocence?</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The rebellion of the Muslim tribe led by 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai further jeopardized Muhammad's position, as he began to lose influence over his followers as a prophet. In response, Muhammad, as he often did, claimed to receive new "revelations." Not only did he assert a revelation regarding 'Aisha's innocence, but he claimed a series of revelations that served his political purposes concerning this incident.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">'Aisha (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4757">Sahih Bukhari, 4757</a>) stated that two days after Muhammad's first public appearance (which itself happened after one month of the incident), he approached her and claimed to have received a revelation, specifically Surah an-Nur. Now, let us examine this Surah an-Nur and how it conveniently aligned with Muhammad's political objectives (<a href="https://quranx.com/24.1?context=30">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #3598db;"><strong>[Verses 1-3]</strong></span> ... The woman and the man guilty of fornication, flog each one of them with a hundred stripes ...The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist,</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Purpose of these verses</span>:</strong> This verse should serve as an "argument" for the innocence of 'Aisha, i.e. since Muhammad is neither a fornicator nor a polytheist himself, thus he also didn't marry any female fornicator (i.e. 'Aisha). Nevertheless, this so-called Quranic Argument is flawed and totally against the logic and indeed a poor pious woman may get a husband who is a fornicator and vice versa. It only shows the colours of 'Human Error' in the so-called divine Revelation.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #3598db;"><strong>[Verse 4]</strong></span> As for those persons who charge chaste women with false accusations but do not produce <strong>four witnesses</strong>, flog them with eighty stripes and never accept their evidence afterwards, for they themselves are transgressors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Purpose of this verse</span>:</strong>   Muhammad wanted to punish all those companions who doubted 'Aisha (as, by doing so, they were <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>INDIRECTLY</strong></span> making the position of Muhammad as a prophet doubtful and weak too. After one month, Muhammad asked his companions to kill 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai (the alleged Hypocrite according to Islam). However, Muhammad failed in his plan and 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai managed to evade Muhammad's plan to have him killed (Reference: <a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/">Sahih Bukhari 4141 </a>). However, Muhammad still desired to set an example and impose severe punishment on those companions who testified against the character of 'Aisha and indirectly weakened his position as a prophet. To achieve this, Muhammad introduced a completely new condition, unprecedented in prior history. He decreed that if there were fewer than four witnesses, then the remaining 3 witnesses would be subjected to 80 lashes, even if their testimony was truthful.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #3598db;"><strong>[Verses 5-25]</strong></span> ... Why did the <strong>faithful</strong> men and women <b><span style="color: #e67e23;">not (immediately) think well of their people</span> (i.e. 'Aisha and Safwan)</b> when they heard this, and said: <b>"<span style="color: #843fa1;">This is a Clear Lie?</span>"</b> ... Why did you not say as soon as you heard it: <b>"<span style="color: #169179;">It is not for us to speak of it</span>? God preserve us, <span style="color: #e03e2d;">it is a great Slander!</span>"</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Purpose of these verses</span>:</strong> It was not only 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai along with 3 more Sahaba, but almost all the companions were doubting 'Aisha and thus Muhammad's prophethood too indirectly. Thus, Muhammad used these verses in order to rebuke all of them, so that they stop doubting 'Aisha's character and Muhammad's claim of prophethood. But the issue is, inside the home:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Muhammad was himself fully doubtful about 'Aisha,</em></li>
<li><em>and he himself didn't immediately think well of 'Aisha,</em></li>
<li><em>and he himself didn't say: "This is a lie clear".</em></li>
<li><em>And he himself didn't ask for 4 witnesses, but he directly started consultation to divorce 'Aisha.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>It proves that Muhammad was himself doing exactly the opposite of what the Quran was saying. Or in more simple words, Muhammad declared the revelation of these verses in order to rebuke others, and he thought his own story (i.e. he was himself doubting 'Aisha) would perhaps not come to the light. But 'Aisha indeed told the inside story later too, exposing Muhammad that he was no different than those Sahaba who were doubting 'Aisha's character.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #3598db;"><strong>[Verse 26]</strong></span> I<strong>mpure women are for impure men and impure men for impure women, and pure women are for pure men and pure men for pure women.</strong> They are free from those scandals which the slanderers utter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Purpose of this verse</span>:</strong> Once more, the author of the Quran (Muhammad himself) employed this as an 'argument' to persuade people to believe in 'Aisha's innocence. However, this Quranic argument is fundamentally flawed and illogical. For example, the Quran itself claims that the wife of Lut was not righteous etc. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId278223"></a>Muhammad '<span style="color: #ff0000;">outside</span>' the house vs. Muhammad '<span style="color: #ff0000;">inside</span>' the house </h2>
<p>Let us examine Muhammad's conduct outside the house during his first public appearance, which occurred approximately a month later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4757">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4757</a>: </p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Aisha: ... Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up and addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, he said, "To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a <em><strong>'forged story'</strong></em> against my wife. By Allah, <em><strong>I do not know anything bad about her</strong></em>. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man (i.e. Safwan) about whom I have <em><strong>never known anything bad</strong></em>, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Thus In public:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad <strong>totally denied</strong> this slander as a "<strong>forged story</strong>".</li>
<li>And when he said {By Allah, <strong>I do not know anything bad about her</strong>}, then he gave the impression that neither he ever doubted 'Aisha, nor he ever doubted Safwan (the man who found 'Aisha) right from the beginning. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, Muhammad's fortune took a turn for the worse when 'Aisha revealed the complete opposite behaviour of Muhammad during the incident that transpired "inside the house." It became evident that not only did Muhammad doubt 'Aisha from the beginning, but he continued to harbour doubts until the very end.</p>
<blockquote>

Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me.</b> By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' <b>Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed;</b> ... ('Aisha further said after that immediately revelation started coming to Muhammad and he said to her) 'O `Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger). I replied, <b>'By Allah, I will not go to him,</b> and I praise none but Allah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly, it may not have been in Muhammad's interest to publicly express doubt about 'Aisha to those outside his household.</p>
<p>However, this serves as evidence that Muhammad may have misled people by dismissing the story as "forged" while privately harbouring doubts about 'Aisha's character throughout.</p>
<p>From a logical perspective, one questions whether a person who resorts to such deception in pursuit of personal interests can truly be considered a genuine Prophet?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId70939"></a>Muhammad continued with his claim of never doubting 'Aisha (but this time with the help of REVELATION)</h2>
<p>During his initial public appearance, Muhammad presented himself to the people outside of his household as if he had never doubted 'Aisha's character. After one month, he continued with the same strategy, but this time his claim came with the extra help of the revelation. Muhammad was deeply angered by those who continued to believe in the incident, which posed a threat to his claim of prophethood. In order to admonish these individuals, Muhammad claimed the revelation of the following Quranic verses approximately one month later:</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/24.12?context=4">Quran 24:12-16</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did the <strong>faithful</strong> men and women <b><span style="color: #e67e23;">not (immediately) think well of their people</span> (i.e. 'Aisha and Safwan)</b> when they heard this, and said: <b>"<span style="color: #843fa1;">This is a clear lie?</span>"</b> ... Why did you not say as soon as you heard it: <b>"<span style="color: #169179;">It is not for us to speak of it</span>? God preserve us, <span style="color: #e03e2d;">it is a great slander!</span>"</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these verses, the Quran put these conditions of faithful men and women i.e.:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">thinking well about 'Aisha and Safwan immediately. </li>
<li aria-level="1">Absolutely not speaking of it.</li>
<li aria-level="1">and denying it as an obvious falsehood, lie and a slander. </li>
</ol>
<p>But the problem occurred when later, 'Aisha also told the story, which happened <b>inside the house</b> during that period, where:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">It was also Muhammad himself who neither thought good about 'Aisha,</li>
<li aria-level="1">nor did he stop speaking about it, but he started consulting others about divorcing 'Aisha.</li>
<li aria-level="1">nor did Muhammad immediately deny it as an obvious falsehood and a big lie and a slander. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, 'Aisha provides a different perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad began to doubt 'Aisha.</li>
<li>Muhammad's kindness towards 'Aisha diminished, even when she was ill. He would only greet her and then leave.</li>
<li>Muhammad initiated investigations into 'Aisha's character, seeking information from Ali, Zayd (the adopted son), and Barira (the maid-servant) within his home.</li>
<li>He consulted them about the possibility of divorcing 'Aisha.</li>
<li>Even after one month, Muhammad continued to doubt 'Aisha, asking her to confess and repent if she had committed a sin.</li>
<li>'Aisha expressed deep disappointment with Muhammad's behavior, to the extent that she refused to engage in direct conversation with him.</li>
<li>She also refused to testify her innocence to Muhammad, believing that he had already been influenced by planted slander and would not accept her testimony.</li>
<li>'Aisha further explained that if she were to falsely confess to a sin, Muhammad would readily believe it.</li>
<li>'Aisha turned her face away from Muhammad and laid on the other side of the bed.</li>
<li>Despite Muhammad claiming divine revelation that proved 'Aisha's innocence, she remained upset with his behavior. When her mother asked her to accompany Muhammad, 'Aisha refused to go with him.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a logical perspective, it becomes apparent that Muhammad used the revelation to reprimand others for the very actions he himself had committed. In reality, Muhammad's behaviour inflicted the greatest pain on 'Aisha, surpassing the actions of any other individual.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId877911"></a>How did Muhammad know Allah would '<span style="color: #e03e2d;">soon</span>' reveal the verses of innocence of 'Aisha after one month?</h2>
<p>For the entire month, there was no revelation affirming 'Aisha's innocence. However, Muhammad visited 'Aisha at her parent's house and assured her that Allah would soon reveal the verses regarding her innocence. Astonishingly, merely a minute later, Muhammad claimed that the revelation had arrived, absolving 'Aisha of all accusations.</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/">Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of the slander. <b>A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case</b>. Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so and so about you; if you are innocent,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <b>then soon Allah will reveal your innocence</b></span>, <strong>and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness</strong> for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance ... <strong>(Aisha said) 'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, </strong>and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me ... Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed ... <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>But, by Allah, before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left his seat</strong> and before any of the household left,<strong> the Divine inspiration came to Allah's Messenger</strong> (about my innocence)</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, Muhammad's ability to claim that a revelation would soon come for 'Aisha's innocence indicates that he had full control over the timing of revelations. It is quite remarkable that the revelation arrived instantly, right after Muhammad and 'Aisha concluded their conversation, just as Muhammad had predicted.</p>
<p>This serves as evidence that there is no divine entity, Allah, in the heavens, but rather Muhammad himself was the source of these revelations, creating them at will and on the spot.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId182187"></a>Quranic order to lash the eyewitnesses if their number is less than 4 (even if they are telling the truth)</h2>
<p>During the incident of Ifk, Muhammad asserted the revelation of verse 24 of Surah Nur. This verse introduced a completely novel condition that had no prior or subsequent precedent in the world. It mandated that if the number of witnesses is less than 4, all of them should be subjected to 80 lashes, <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>even if their testimony is truthful</strong></span>.</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/24.4">Surah Nur 24:4</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses - <strong>lash them with eighty lashes</strong> and do not accept from them testimony ever after.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary motive behind the revelation of this order by the writer of the Quran (Muhammad) can be attributed to the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad aimed to establish <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>'Abdullah Ibn Ubai</strong></span> as a deterrent example for those who doubted 'Aisha's innocence and, by extension, Muhammad's prophethood. His plan to eliminate 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai as a punishment fell through when he managed to evade it.</li>
<li>Additionally, Muhammad faced a significant challenge when the Muslim tribe led by 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai openly defied his authority as a prophet, fueling tensions that could potentially escalate into conflict. This situation posed a threat to Muhammad's influence over his followers, thereby necessitating a decisive action to regain control.</li>
<li>Consequently, even if 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai managed to escape punishment, Muhammad still sought to administer severe penalties to someone else as a means of setting an example for all those who harbored doubts about his prophethood.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/">Sahih Bukhari 4141</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up on the pulpit and complained about <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong>`Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul)</strong></span> before his companions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and he was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on quietening them till they became silent and so did he.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human logic dictates that the Islamic ruling of lashing witnesses, <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>even if they are telling the truth</strong></span>, goes against rationality. This illogical directive raises doubts about the divine origin of the revelations and suggests that Muhammad himself may have been fabricating them to suit his political agenda. Such evidence of "human error" undermines the credibility of the revelation.</p>
<p>In fact, many modern Muslim countries have recognized the absurdity of this Quranic ruling and have chosen to abandon it. Today, witnesses in cases of adultery are not subjected to the punishment of 80 lashes, even if their numbers are less than four. This pragmatic approach reflects a departure from the rigid application of an outdated and unreasonable directive.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId242783"></a>The Quranic claim that Pure Men have only the pure Women</h2>
<p>The Quranic assertion that pure men have only pure women is presented as an argument supporting 'Aisha's innocence, as she was married to a pure man, Muhammad, according to the revelation in Surah Nur.</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/24.3?context=24">Surah Nur 4:3 and 4:26</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist, and that has been made unlawful to the believers ۔۔۔ Women impure are for men impure, and men impure for women impure and women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity: these are not affected by what people say: for them there is forgiveness, and a provision honorable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Kathir wrote in his Tafsir under verse 26 of Surah Nur:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Evil women are for evil men and evil men are for evil women, and good women are for good men and good men are for good women.<i> This also necessarily refers back to what they said, i.e., </i><b><i>Allah would not have made `A'ishah the wife of His Messenger unless she had been good, because he is the best of the best of mankind. If she had been evil, she would not have been a suitable partner either according to His Laws or His decree</i></b><i>.<br></i><a href="http://m.qtafsir.com/Surah-An-Noor/The-Goodness-of-%60Aishah-becau---">Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Nur 24:26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the Qur'an itself provides examples that challenge the claim that pure men only have pure women. The story of Lut's wife, who was not pure-hearted despite Lut being a pure man, and the example of Pharaoh's wife, who was considered pure while Pharaoh himself was not, contradict this argument. Additionally, the wife of Noah is also mentioned as not being pure. These examples reveal the flaws in the argument put forth by the Qur'an and Muhammad, indicating the human nature of the revelation and raising doubts about the existence of Allah and the authenticity of Muhammad's claims of being a prophet. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId620933"></a>The Role of so-called 'Islamic Modesty' in the incident of Ifk</h2>
<p>The idea of the so-called 'Islamic Modesty' plays a <b>negative</b> role in this incident too:</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/">Sahih Bukhari 4141</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: ... <b>I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt)</b>. So we went on till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. <b>(In the meanwhile) the people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it</b>...They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of hijab in Islam requires the complete separation of women from unrelated men in society. Even conversations and interactions between men and women are considered inappropriate and contrary to Islamic modesty.</p>
<p>As a result, during this journey, Aisha was concealed from the view of men behind the curtains of her howdah. Since men and women were not even allowed to greet each other, the men who lifted her howdah couldn't confirm her presence by simply saying hello.</p>
<p>The consequences of these circumstances were severe. Aisha spent the entire month in tears and pain, despite her innocence. Even Muhammad, who harbored no kindness towards her, allowed this slander to affect him, further exacerbating the situation. This division among Muslims led to a dangerous conflict between the two factions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Imposing such restrictions in the name of Islamic modesty goes against human nature. These unnatural limitations instill paranoia and skepticism within society, resulting in a disturbed state of mind. Muslims struggle to comprehend why companions like Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah slandered Aisha. However, it seems that these unnatural restrictions have made members of Islamic society so paranoid that they start believing in things that are not actually true. (Note: Muslims still hold high regard for these two companions by using "Radhi Allahu 'Anhu" when referring to them).</p>
<p>Even today, thousands of <strong>honor killings</strong> occur in Islamic societies, based solely on suspicions and paranoia.</p>
<p>The root cause of this month-long ordeal was the restriction on interaction between men and women in the name of Islamic modesty. </p>
<p>Also, see this lack of interaction between them when Safwan found 'Asiha.</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/">Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated 'Aisha: ... While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me <b>as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed)</b>. So I woke up when he recited Istirja' (i.e. "Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un") as soon as he recognized me, <b>I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word</b>, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">How could Islam be considered a 'religion of nature' when it has made it so difficult that even in emergencies, men and women don't even exchange a single word?</li>
<li aria-level="1">What could have happened if they had greeted each other, and Safwan had asked her about the problem in detail (and perhaps helped her in finding her necklace), why she was alone there, and if she needed some other kind of help too in that situation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Even in present times, Muslim women and girls face difficulty in seeking assistance without hesitation in various fields, whether it be from male doctors, male teachers, or others. The imposition of these unnatural restrictions drains a significant amount of energy from society, rendering half of the Islamic society, namely women, practically useless and unable to contribute to productivity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId548081"></a>Why did Muhammad use to take his wives during the battles?</h2>
<p>During the pre-Islamic era known as Jahiliyyah in Arabia, kings ruled like dictators. They forbade their common soldiers from bringing their wives along on journeys, yet they themselves indulged in the company of their own wives, despite the added burden it placed on their armies.</p>
<p>Muhammad, too, followed the practices of these dictatorial kings. The incident of Ifk took place when Muhammad took 'Aisha with him on a particular journey.</p>
<p>In the same Hadith regarding the incident of Ifk, 'Aisha narrated:</p>
<p><a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/">Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots amongst his wives, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to take with him the one on whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the Ghazwat (in which the incident of Ifk happened) which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).</p>

<p>Dogs unfortunately became scapegoats.</p>
<p>This began when the pagans of Mecca presented three questions to Muhammad as a test. However, he was unable to provide answers for the next 15 days. Muhammad then offered an excuse, stating that Gabriel had not visited him with the answers because there was a puppy in his home.</p>
<p>Imam Syuti documented the following tradition in the commentary on verse <a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;tAyahNo=23&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">18:23 (link)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic">أخرج ابن المنذرعن مجاهد، أن قريشاً اجتمعت فقالوا: " يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، فما هذا الدين الذي جئت به؟ قال: هذا دين جئت به من الرحمن. فقالوا: إنا لا نعرف الرحمن، إلا رحمن اليمامة - يعنون مسيلمة الكذاب - ثم كاتبوا اليهود فقالوا: قد نبغ فينا رجل يزعم أنه نبي، وقد رغب عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، ويزعم أن الذي جاء به من الرحمن. قلنا: لا نعرف الرحمن إلا رحمن اليمامة، وهو أمين لا يخون.. وفيّ لا يغدر.. صدوق لا يكذب، وهو في حسب وثروة من قومه، فاكتبوا إلينا بأشياء نسأله عنها. فاجتمعت يهود فقالوا: إن هذا لوصفه وزمانه الذي يخرج فيه. فكتبوا إلى قريش: أن سلوه عن أمر أصحاب الكهف، وعن ذي القرنين، وعن الروح. فإن يكن الذي أتاكم به من الرحمن، فإن الرحمن هو الله عز وجل، وإن يكن من رحمن اليمامة فينقطع. فلما أتى ذلك قريشاً أتى الظفر في أنفسها فقالوا: يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائك... فحدثنا عن أمر أصحاب الكهف وذي القرنين والروح. قال: ائتوني غداً. ولم يستثن، فمكث جبريل عنه ما شاء الله لا يأتيه، ثم أتاه فقال: سألوني عن أشياء لم يكن عندي بها علم فأجيب حتى شق ذلك عليّ. قال: ألم ترنا لا ندخل بيتاً فيه كلب ولا صورة؟ - وكان في البيت جرو كلب - ونزلت { ولا تقولن لشيء إني فاعل ذلك غداً إلا أن يشاء الله واذكر ربك إذا نسيت وقل عسى أن يهدين ربي لأقرب من هذا رشداً } من علم الذي سألتموني عنه أن يأتي قبل غد؟ ونزل ما ذكر من أصحاب الكهف ونزل<b>{ <span class="TextAyah">ويسألونك عن الروح...</span> }</b> [الإسراء: 85] الآية ".</span></p>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic">Ibn Mundhir narrated from Mujahid that the pagans of Quraysh gathered and said to Muhammad, "You have deviated from the religion of our ancestors. Where did you get this new religion from?" Muhammad replied, "This religion is from Rahman (i.e. another name of Allah)." The Quraysh responded, "We only know Rahman  from Yemen." They associated Musaylmah Kadhab with it, who was another person claiming false prophethood during Muhammad's era and also claimed his new religion was from al-Rahman, i.e., God. Then, the Quraysh wrote to the Jews, informing them that a person had emerged among them claiming to be a prophet, having abandoned the religion of their ancestors ... The Jews replied, "Ask him three questions about the Ashab-e-Kuhf (the People of the Cave), Dhulqarnain, and the spirit. If he can answer these questions, then he is from Rahman, who is God. But if Rahman is from Yemen, he will not be able to answer them." The Quraysh became pleased with this and said to Muhammad, "If you have already abandoned the religion of our ancestors, then tell us about the Ashab-e-Kuhf, Dhulqarnain, and the spirit." Muhammad told them, "Come to me tomorrow (and I will answer)." However, Muhammad forgot to say Insha-Allah (i.e., if Allah wills). Gabriel appeared to him after only 15 days. Muhammad said to Gabriel, "The Quraysh came to me and asked me about certain things (as a test of my prophethood), but I didn't know the answers. I was in a very difficult situation during this period." Gabriel replied, "Have you not seen that we (i.e., the angels) do not enter a house with a dog or a picture? There was a puppy in your house, and you were not aware of it." Consequently, the following revelation was sent down: "[... and do not say of anything, 'Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,' except (when adding), 'If Allah wills.' Quran 18:22-24]" (i.e., the puppy entered his house while he forgot to say Insha-Allah).<br></span></p>

<p>The actual situation was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muhammad neither knew the answers to the three questions nor was he in contact with any Allah or angel.</li>
<li>Consequently, Muhammad began seeking information from others, which took him 15 days to gather.</li>
<li>However, Muhammad made an excuse that he was unable to answer the questions as he had forgotten to say Insha-Allah (if God wills). And he claimed that a puppy entering his house prevented Gabriel from delivering the answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are reasons to question the validity of this excuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad went outside of his house during those 15 days to relieve himself and pray in the mosques. Why didn't Gabriel come to him there?</li>
<li>How was it that the purity of a great angel like Gabriel could not overcome the presence of a small puppy?</li>
<li>Why couldn't the purity of Muhammad himself overcome the impurity of a small puppy?</li>
<li>What about the two angels, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiraman_Katibin"><em>Kiraman Katibin</em></a>, who are said to sit on the shoulders of every person, recording their deeds? Are Kiraman Katibin also expelled from the house by dogs, allowing one to commit sins inside without being recorded?</li>
<li>Furthermore, if dogs are truly considered impure, why did the "people of the cave أصحاب الكهف" take a dog along with them?</li>
</ul>
<p>In simple terms, it appears that Muhammad used the puppy as a scapegoat for his inability to answer the questions the next day.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId949643"></a>Muhammad's Allah didn't know about the Panting of dogs </h2>
<p>After the incident of Muhammad's test, he continued to present dogs in a bad light. </p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/7.176">7:176</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So his example is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants. That is the example of the people who denied Our signs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse compares the actions of those who deny the signs of Allah to the behavior of a dog, stating that if you chase him or leave him, he pants. This analogy raises questions about the connection between panting and accepting or rejecting the message.</p>
<p>Muhammad's Allah seemingly did not acknowledge that panting is a natural process for dogs to regulate their body temperature through evaporation, similar to how humans cool down through sweating. However, using panting as a symbol of rejecting the message appears to be an illogical and erroneous comparison.</p>
<p>Sweating, a natural bodily process in humans, does not imply rejection of a message. Therefore, it is puzzling why the panting of dogs would be attributed to message rejection.</p>
<p>This example is highly flawed and does not align with the wisdom one would expect from a divine entity characterized as All-Wise.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId833021"></a>Orders of killing all Dogs in Medina</h2>
<p>The situation in Medina after Muhammad's arrival unfolded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muhammad had already declared dogs to be impure and discouraged their presence as pets inside homes, as it would invalidate prayers.</li>
<li>However, the people of the desert, whose livelihoods revolved around livestock, cherished their dogs, considering them highly valuable. Consequently, there were roaming dogs within the city of Medina.</li>
<li>The Jewish community in Medina was aware of the incident in which Muhammad used the excuse of a puppy in his house to explain the delay in Gabriel's arrival with revelation for 15 days. Simultaneously, they observed that Muslims from the Aus and Khazraj tribes in Medina kept dogs in close proximity to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears that Muhammad grew displeased with the behavior of the Aus and Khazraj tribes, who disregarded his explicit orders to remove dogs from their houses. This might have been a motivating factor behind Muhammad eventually issuing a command to kill all dogs in Medina.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId567896"></a>The Hints of Human Drama in the Revelations Regarding the Killing of Dogs</h2>
<p>The Evolution of Sharia Ruling on the Killing of Dogs in Four Stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Stage: Initially, Muhammad commanded the killing of all dogs, regardless of their roles or appearances.</li>
<li>2nd Stage: In response to public outcry against the mass killing of dogs, then Allah (i.e. Muhammad) revised the ruling, allowing people to keep dogs for hunting and livestock protection while maintaining the directive to kill all other dogs.</li>
<li>3rd Stage: However, further protests led to another revision, whereby the Divine Allah rescinded the order to kill all other dogs, except those with black coloration. In this stage, black dogs were deemed as associated with devils.</li>
<li>4th Stage: Continuing opposition to the killing of black dogs prompted yet another revision. Then Allah (i.e. Muhammad) reversed the ruling once more, abolishing the killing of all black dogs, except for those that were jet-black with two spots on their eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout these four stages, the Sharia ruling regarding the killing of dogs underwent transformations due to the protests and concerns raised by the people.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1572">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1572</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill (all) dogs, and we carried out this order so much so that we also kill the dog coming with a woman from the desert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2845">Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2845</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Were dogs not a species of creature I should command that they all be killed; but kill every pure black one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:510a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 510a</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Dharr reported: The Messenger of 'Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguishes it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as you are asking me, and he said: <strong><em>The black dog is a devil</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1572">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1572</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill (all) dogs ... Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) forbade their killing. He (the Prophet further) said: It is your duty (to kill) the jet-black (dog) having<strong> <em>two spots (on the eyes), for it is a devil</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an Intriguing Contradiction in the Sharia Rulings on Dogs.</p>
<p>The contradiction becomes apparent when considering that if the devil was not present in dogs other than the jet-black ones with two spots on their eyes, why did Muhammad/Allah initially decree the killing of all other innocent dogs who did not possess any demonic qualities?</p>
<p>It is crucial to remember that a "divine revelation" should not be subject to trial and error but rather should embody the flawless wisdom of an All-Wise God from its very inception.</p>
<p>When examining the evolution of Islamic orders regarding alcohol, we observe a progression from leniency to strictness in three stages, reflecting an understanding of human psychology. Initially, praying while intoxicated was prohibited, followed by a complete prohibition of alcohol, and finally, the introduction of 80 lashes as punishment.</p>
<p>However, the case of dogs follows an opposite trajectory—orders transitioned from strict to lenient. This means that the initial decree to kill all dogs went against human psychology, and subsequent modifications were made due to the protests of people who vehemently opposed the killing of their pet dogs and advocated for the retention of dogs for hunting and guarding purposes.</p>
<p>Muhammad/Allah was indeed compelled to change the orders due to the intense opposition and protest from people who were unwilling to part with their beloved canine companions. This sentiment of resistance is evident in the hadith:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1573a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1573a</a>: </p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Mughaffal reported: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered the killing of dogs and then said: <em><strong>what is the trouble with them (i.e. Why were the people protesting)? How are dogs a nuisance to them (the citizens of Medina)?</strong></em> He then permitted the keeping of dogs for hunting and (the protection of) herds.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In conclusion, a divine revelation should be grounded in divine wisdom rather than relying on a trial-and-error approach.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId213799"></a>The Hints of Human Drama within the Revelations (Part 2: The Influence of Superstitions on Muhammad's Beliefs)</h2>
<p>In various parts of the world, the belief that encountering a black cat is a sign of bad luck prevails. Muslims, however, reject this notion and often mock Hindus and others who adhere to such superstitions. Look at this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121107043021/http://shaheedeislam.com/aap-k-masaul-or-un-ka-hal/ap-k-masail-or-unka-hal-jild-1/1267-toham-parasti">Fatwa</a>, where the Mufti is asserting that believing in such superstitions is a sign of ignorance.</p>
<p>Muslims are justified in their dismissal of this superstition, as there is no inherent malevolence associated with either black cats or their act of crossing paths.</p>
<p>However, it is noteworthy that Muhammad himself was influenced by superstitions prevalent in the ignorant Arab society of his time. One such superstition pertained to the black ram, which Muhammad adopted due to the customs and beliefs of his society.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1967">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1967</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded that <em><strong>a ram with black legs, black belly and black (circles) round the eyes</strong></em> should be brought to him, so that he should sacrifice it. He said to 'A'isha: Give me the large knife, and then said: Sharpen it on a stone. She did that. He then took it (the knife) and then the ram; he placed it on the ground and then sacrificed it</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Muhammad took the prevailing superstition surrounding the color black a step further by associating it with black dogs, resulting in more severe implications. While other cultures limited their belief in black cats as bad omens, Muhammad declared that black dogs were not only ill-fated signs but considered devils themselves.</p>
<p>According to Muhammad's teachings, the presence of a black dog could disrupt prayers or even sever the connection to the divine if they were in the vicinity or present within a household. Such beliefs were taken to an extreme extent, with Muhammad advocating for the killing of all black dogs.</p>
<p>By intertwining superstition with his religious teachings, Muhammad reinforced the negative perception of black dogs, exacerbating the superstitions surrounding them and promoting their harm. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:510a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 510a</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of 'Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguish it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as you are asking me, and he said: <em><strong>The black dog is a devil</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/black%20dog.png" alt="Black dog devil or best &amp; loyal friend" width="658" height="406" loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/black dog.png"></p>
<p>Dear Muslims,</p>
<p>When you look at this black dog, do you perceive it as a devil deserving to be killed? Alternatively, do you recognize it as a loving, caring, and loyal friend to this baby?</p>
<p>I urge you to tap into the humanity within you to make a compassionate and informed decision. Trust in your innate sense of compassion, as it will always guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>It is essential to remember that the historical orders attributed to Muhammad, commanding the killing of all black dogs or black dogs with two spots on their eyes, still exist today. Consider carefully whether you truly believe in implementing such directives in the present time.</p>
<p>Let empathy and reason guide your actions, ensuring that you treat all living beings with kindness and respect.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId145170"></a>Questionable Fabrication: Separating the Puppy Excuse from Gabriel's Delay in Muslim Accounts</h2>
<p>Muslims claim that the incident of the puppy didn't happen during Muhammad's test in Mecca, but later in Medina. They present the following tradition by 'Aisha:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2104a">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2104a</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A'isha reported that Gabriel (peace be upon him) made a promise with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to come at a definite hour; that hour came but he did not visit him. And there was in his hand (in the hand of Allah's Apostle) a staff. He threw it from his hand and said: Never has Allah or His messengers (angels) ever broken their promise. Then he cast a glance (and by chance) found a puppy under his cot <strong>and said: 'A'isha, when did this dog enter here? She said: By Allah, I don't know </strong>He then commanded and it was turned out. Then Gabriel came and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: You promised me and I waited for you, but you did not come, whereupon he said: It was the dog in your house which prevented me (to come), for we (angels) do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>Muhammad's explanation that the presence of a puppy prevented Gabriel from visiting him for 15 days appears to be a highly implausible excuse. As a result, it seems that Muslims attempted to disassociate the puppy incident from Muhammad's inability to answer the questions during that time. This intention becomes evident through the creation of fabricated Hadiths aimed at separating the dog's involvement from Muhammad's 15-day struggle.</p>
<p>The fabrication becomes even more apparent when we examine the <strong>contradictory</strong> Hadith attributed to 'Aisha herself. I<strong>n this Hadith, she denies witnessing such an incident unfold before her eyes </strong>(although in the first tradition, she is present on the spot and witnesses the incident directly).</p>
<p>This raises doubts about the authenticity of the accounts that aim to isolate the puppy incident from Gabriel's delay, suggesting a deliberate effort to alter the narrative and mitigate Muhammad's inability to answer the questions during that critical period.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2106f">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2106f</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Talha Ansari reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture or portraits. I came to 'A'isha and said to her: This is a news that I have received that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had said: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture or a dog, (and further added)<em><strong> <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">whether she had heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) making a mention of it. She said: No (I did not hear this myself)</span>, </strong></em>but I narrate to you what I saw him doing. I bear testimony to the fact that he (the Holy Prophet) set out for an expedition. I took a carpet and screened the door with it. When he (the Holy Prophet) came back he saw that carpet and I perceived signs of disapproval on his face. He pulled it until it was torn or it was cut (into pieces) and he said: God has not commanded us to clothe stones and clay. We cut it (the curtain) and prepared two pillowa out of it by stuffing them with the fibre of date-palms and he (the Holy Prophet) did not find fault with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon examining the contradictory traditions present in Sahih Muslim, a clear 180-degree contradiction emerges. This raises several logical possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first tradition could have been fabricated by later Islamic apologists.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the second tradition may have been fabricated by later Islamic apologists.</li>
<li>It is also plausible that both traditions were fabricated by later Islamic apologists.</li>
</ol>
<p>These contradictory traditions strongly suggest that the later Islamic apologists had a motive for concealing or altering certain aspects of the narrative. It is highly probable that their intention was to obscure or downplay Muhammad's excuse of the puppy's presence hindering Gabriel's entry into his house, which ultimately resulted in Muhammad's failure to provide timely answers.</p>
<p>The fabrication of these traditions serves as evidence that later Islamic apologists aimed to manipulate the narrative, possibly to shield or downplay Muhammad's shortcomings during the incident.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId277709"></a>2nd Apologetic Excuse: Traditions of Ali and Maimuna also prove that this incident happened in Medina and not in Mecca</h2>
<p>Islam algologists also bring the following 2 traditions:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/ahmad:845">Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 845:</a></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">It was narrated that ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I used to come to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) every morning. If he cleared his throat, I would enter, and if he remained silent, I would not enter. He came out to me (on one occasion) and said: “Something happened last night. I heard some movement in the house, then I saw Jibreel (عليه السلام). I said: ‘What prevented you from entering the house?` He said: “In the house there is a dog.` I went in and I saw a puppy belonging to al-Hasan beneath a chair of ours. He [Jibreel] said: “The angels do not enter a house if there are three things in it: a dog or an image or a person who is junub.`</div>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2105">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2105:</a></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Maimuna reported that one morning Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was silent with grief. Maimuna said: Allah's Messenger, I find a change in your mood today. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Gabriel had promised me that he would meet me tonight, but he did not meet me. By Allah, he never broke his promises, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) spent the day in this sad (mood). Then it occurred to him that there had been a puppy under their cot. He commanded and it was turned out. He then took some water in his hand and sprinkled it at that place. When it was evening Gabriel met him and he said to him: you promised me that you would meet me the previous night. He said: Yes, but we do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture. </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>These 2 more Ahadith are not proving the point of view of Islam apologists (i.e. this incident happened in Medina), but:</p>
<ul>
<li>These 2 more Ahadith are also proving the presence of the FABRICATION Factory of Ahadith by Islam apologists.</li>
<li>Not only these 2 more Ahadith are <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>contradicting</strong></span> each other, but they are also contradicting the hadith of 'Aisha too. Logically, this incident can happen with either one of them among 'Aisha, 'Ali and Maimuna. Thus, it is again proof of the fabrication of Ahadith in order to hide the real story. </li>
</ul>
<p>There was no limit to the fabrication of Ahadith by Islam apologists. The whole FACTORY was present there for this purpose. </p>
<p>We request the readers to read our 2 articles on Muslims deception of Fabricating Hadiths:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php?view=article&amp;id=114&amp;catid=26">The Hadith Fabrication Factory in order to save the honour of Islam</a>: There were 131 traditions (including Sahih Ahadith), which were present in Hadith books, which claimed Ishaq was the son who was sacrificed. But later Hadith Fabrication Factory by Islam apologists fabricated 133 traditions (including Sahih Ahadith) in order to counter the first Statement and they claimed it was Ismael who was sacrificed. Through this, they wanted to give preference to Muhammad and his ancestor (Ismael) over Jews and their ancestor Ishaq. </li>
<li><a href="https://atheism-vs-islam.com//index.php/the-unreliability-of-hadith-and-ilm-ul-hadith/295-the-lie-of-moon-splitting-ample-proof-that-hadiths-cannot-be-trusted">The Lie of Moon Splitting: Ample Proof that Hadiths Cannot Be Trusted</a>: There are many of so-called Sahih Hadiths which claim that Muhammad split the moon into two in front of the Meccan Pagans. But all these lies caught red-handed while the Quran itself became a witness that Allah/Muhammad failed to show even a tiniest of any miracle in front of the Meccan Pagans. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId692962"></a>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>In conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unfortunate dogs were unjustly made scapegoats for Muhammad's failure to answer the questions during those 15 days.</li>
<li>Throughout the 1400 years of Islamic history, they were despised and held responsible for a crime they were not even guilty of. </li>
<li>And perhaps the most unfortunate issue is, still today 1.5 billion people HATE dogs due to Muhammad/Allah. </li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we were to assume that the incident with the puppy was unrelated to Muhammad's inability to answer the questions, it remains impossible to accept these Sharia Orders as a "divine revelation" from an All-Wise and All-Knowing entity. These orders are characterized by cruelty, superstitions, and a trial-and-error approach that changes multiple times in response to people's anger and protests.</p>
<p>Even without the explicit order to kill dogs, Muhammad's claim that black dogs are devils is inherently illogical, contradicting the natural sense of compassion within humanity.</p>
<p>These aspects are not indicative of divine revelation but rather reflect the intricate complexities and dynamics of human drama.</p>

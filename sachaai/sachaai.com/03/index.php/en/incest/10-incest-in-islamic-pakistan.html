        <p>As a result of oppressive constraints imposed on women and their limited interactions with men, the Islamic society has regrettably reached a state of severe sexual frustration. Shockingly, according to a study conducted in hospitals and gynecologist clinics, approximately 82% of young girls are subjected to rape by close relatives such as fathers, grandfathers, paternal uncles, maternal uncles, brothers, and cousins.</p>
<p>For further insight into this distressing issue, please watch the following video featuring Miss Shandana Gulzar, a Member of the National Assembly Pakistan and a minister of the ruling party PTI. In her discussion, she sheds light on the aforementioned study and its findings. [Please enable the English Captions].</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIDaJLQBaqM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/HamidMirPAK/status/1305532529957535744">Link to the Video </a></p>
<p>However, it is disheartening to observe that many Pakistanis responded to Miss Shandana Gulzar's efforts to bring attention to this societal problem with extreme negativity and irrationality. They unjustly accused her of being a Western agent, spreading false information to tarnish the image of Islam and Pakistan. Shockingly, some even called for her imprisonment and death penalty, accusing her of insulting the religion and the country.</p>
<p>The reality is that this sexual frustration is alarmingly evident in numerous cases of child rape within Madrassas (Quran schools). Furthermore, when girls venture outside, they are frequently subjected to widespread harassment by men.</p>
<p>While incidents of sexual frustration in Madrassas and public spaces are occasionally reported in the media, the rape of small girls taking place within homes largely goes unreported. Pakistan is in dire need of a strong feminist movement to combat these deep-rooted issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<h2>Even 'Google Trends' is also a witness to this sexual frustration</h2>
<p>Pakistanis are at the top for the last 2 decades in search of incest terms like:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2006-01-01%202019-03-03&amp;q=sister%20rape">Sister Rape</a>, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2006-03-15%202019-04-15&amp;q=sister%20porn&amp;hl=en-US">Sister Porn</a>, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2006-03-15%202012-04-15&amp;q=sister%20fucking&amp;hl=en-US">Sister Fucking</a>: From 2006 to 2019, Pakistan consistently held the top position each year in search of these 3 terms. (<strong>Note</strong>: <a href="https://censorship.fandom.com/wiki/Pakistan#:~:text=However%2C%20in%20November%202011%2C%20the,to%20start%20blocking%20pornographic%20websites.">Pakistani Government banned Pornographic Websites in 2011</a>, But still this trend didn't end immediately. And still 'sister porn' was the most searched term on Google search from Pakistan till 2019. Please adjust the settings on "<a href="https://trends.google.com/">Google Trends</a>" to see the report for each year from 2006 to 2019).</li>
<li><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2006-01-01%202012-01-01&amp;q=mother%20rape">Mother Rape</a>: Pakistan was at the top every year from 2006 to 2012 (till a ban on pornographic websites by the Pakistani government). </li>
<li><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2006-02-03%202023-03-03&amp;q=child%20sex">Child Sex</a>: Pakistan is at the top from 2006 till 2023 (and even the ban on pornographic websites didn't dethrone Pakistanis from searching for it).</li>
<li><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2006-02-03%202023-03-03&amp;q=donkey%20rape">Donkey Rape</a>: Pakistan is at the top from 2006 till 2023 (and even the ban didn't stop them from searching for it). </li>
</ol>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: Pornographic website Pornhub also publish its list of visitors from every country. But you will not see Pakistan on the list there, while the Pakistani Government has banned this website. And Pakistanis visit this website only through VPN)</p>
<p>Unless Pakistanis grant freedom to their women and facilitate natural interaction between men and women, their entire society will continue to bear the consequences of this profound sexual frustration (especially the small girls).</p>
<h2>Dead bodies of girls are taken out of their GRAVES and raped in Islamic Pakistan</h2>
<p>The level of frustration among Pakistani men has escalated to such an extent that it includes disturbing incidents of desecrating the graves of women and raping their lifeless bodies (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;rlz=1C1IBEF_deDE974DE974&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBtSvH7ps63b4wIFsRwMyt_b-Tt_ig%3A1646748029197&amp;ei=fWEnYqXNC8qG9u8P0vOu2AE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl_8G61rb2AhVKg_0HHdK5CxsQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=dead+bodies+of+women+raped+in+Pakistan&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6CAguENQCEJECOgsILhCABBDHARCjAjoLCC4QgAQQxwEQ0QM6BQgAEIAEOgoIABCRAhBGEPkBOgUIABCRAjoECAAQQzoHCC4Q1AIQQzoICC4QgAQQ1AI6BQguEJECOgQILhBDOggILhDUAhDLAToFCC4QywE6BQgAEMsBOgcIABAKEMsBOgcILhAKEMsBOgUILhCABDoICAAQFhAKEB46BggAEBYQHkoECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWKc0YKo2aAFwAXgAgAGaA4gB8UCSAQswLjE3LjE4LjMuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz">link</a>). There have been reports indicating that the situation has become so dire that the relatives of deceased women are compelled to stand guard at their graves during the initial nights in cemeteries. When you link the Hijab with rape, it follows you to the grave.</p>
<p>And watch this video (Urdu) where one man raped 48 dead women in their graves:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/chxsKhXOu60?start=103" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>2.5 million illegal abortions in Pakistan in one year</h2>
<p>The famous organization "<strong>Population Council</strong>" published a report (<a href="https://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/2014RH_PostabortionCare_Pakistan.pdf">link</a>) of their research, that alone in the year 2012, there were 2.5 million illegal abortions which took place in Pakistan.</p>
<p>We encourage you to revisit the interview with Miss Shandana Gulzar, where she sheds light on a distressing observation made by hospitals and gynaecologist clinics. It has been observed that mothers of sexually assaulted young girls are unwilling to report the cases to the police due to the involvement of their own husbands, fathers, brothers, or sons in these heinous acts. And the Islamic system of proving rape is also absolutely not helpful, but compels women to hide their rape. </p>
<h2>It is almost impossible to prove the charge of Incest on the rapist in Islam:</h2>
<p>Moreover, look at this Islamic Ruling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/urn/415900" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer"><span class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">Muwatta Malik</span> Book 41, Hadith 15</a>:</p>
<p>Malik said, "The position with us about a woman who is found to be pregnant and has no husband and she says, 'I was forced,' or she says, 'I was married,' is that <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">it is not accepted from her and the hadd is inflicted on her unless she has a clear proof of what she claims</strong> about the marriage or that she was forced <strong>or she comes bleeding if she was a virgin</strong> or <strong>she calls out for help so that someone comes to her </strong>and she is in that state or what resembles it of the situation in which the violation occurred." He said, <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">"If she does not produce any of those, the hadd is inflicted on her and what she claims of that is not accepted from her."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">And the largest Fatwa Website (run by Saudi Salafi Muftis) Islam Q&amp;A writes in its fatwa (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/158282/what-is-the-difference-between-the-ruling-on-rape-and-the-ruling-on-fornication-or-adultery-can-rape-be-proven-by-modern-methods">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Rape is essentially zina (fornication or adultery) and is proven in the same way as zina is proven, which is with <strong>four witnesses</strong>. The punishment is one hundred lashes if the man was a virgin and stoning if he was previously married ...  Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She is not to be punished if it is proven that he forced her and overpowered her. <strong>That may be known from her having screamed and shouted for help</strong>. (Al-Istidhkaar, 7/146 ) ...  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very difficult for a raped woman (or a small child girl) to bring proof of her rape. There are no people present where she is raped who can hear her calls for help, and blood also does not always come. The biggest problem is, perhaps 100% of women don't even know about these Islamic Rulings about rape that they have to immediately present their blood in public. Their first reaction is to hide their face along with their rape. Their own families could kill them in the name of Ghairah. </p>
<p>Do you think that small child girls could act upon these Islamic rulings if they are being raped by their own fathers, brothers, uncles or the Mullah in the Quran schools? </p>
<p>Moreover, the Islamic issue of 4 eyewitnesses in the case of rape also plays a role in such cases. These women have little to no hope of winning a case against their own husbands, brothers, or fathers while even DNA Test is also not accepted in Islamic courts without witnesses. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The Largest Islamic Website is Islamweb.Net. It records this Fatwa (<a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/323002/failing-to-produce-four-witnesses-in-accusation-of-rape">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“This means that if a woman accused a pious man of forcing her into adultery and there were no witnesses to prove her claim and she did not drag him by his clothes (to prove the offense), then she should be subjected to the hadd of slander whether or not she is well-known for chastity she should be subjected to the hadd of zina if she becomes pregnant as a result. The same ruling applies if she is proven non-pregnant unless she retracts her claim. If she drags him by his clothes and reports the crime of her own volition, then the hadd of zina is waived from her even if she is proven pregnant given the public defamation that she brought upon herself by reporting the offense. She is still subject to the hadd of slander and has no right to ask the man whom she accused to take an oath and swear to his innocence of the charge brought against him. On the other hand, if she accused a dissolute man of such a crime and she did not drag him by his clothes, then she is not subject to the hadd of slander or zina unless she is proven pregnant. However, if she dragged him by his clothes, then the hadd of zina is waived from her even if she is proven pregnant and the hadd of slander is waived from her as well. Lastly, if she accused a man whose religiosity is unknown and she did not drag him by his clothes, then she is subject to both the hadd of slander and that of zina. If she dragged him by his clothes, then she is not subject for that to the hadd of slander...”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Please tell us, how a poor woman/girl, who has been raped, has a force to drag her rapist in front of people?</p>
<p dir="ltr">And without eye-witnesses, and without have the power/chance to drag her rapist with his clothes in public, if she becomes pregnant, then she will be punished for 80 lashes (if she is a virgin), or she will get stoned if she is a married woman. And her child will automatically become a Bastard (Islamic Term: Walad-ul-haram ولدألحرأم). Do you see any Divine Justice with such a poor woman/girl here?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A recent fatwa from a mainstream Islamic site echoes this rule and even chides a victim of incest for complaining when she has no "evidence":</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=156817">IslamWeb.net</a>, <a href="../../../../../www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/img/Rape-IslamWeb.jpg">Image:</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it is not permissible to accuse the father of rape without evidence. Indeed, the Sharee’ah put some special conditions for proving Zina (fornication or adultery) that are not required in case of other crimes. The crime of Zina is not confirmed except if the fornicator admits it, or with the testimony of four trustworthy men, while <strong>the testimony of women is not accepted</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hence, the statement of this girl or the statement of her mother in itself does not Islamically prove anything against the father, especially that the latter denies it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, if this daughter has no evidence to prove that her accusations are true, <strong>she should not have claimed that she was raped by her father</strong> and she should not have taken him to the court.</p>

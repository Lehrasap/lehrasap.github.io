        <p>Dear people!</p>
<p>Please use your mind and don't let yourself be deceived by the propaganda of Islamic Preachers. </p>
<p>Please remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 3rd world war is not going to send humans to the Stone Age, but it is going to wipe out the human race.</li>
<li>Atomic and hydrogen weapons are so powerful today, that they have the ability to destroy this whole world several times. </li>
<li>The entire world will become inhabitable for human life for the next thousands of years.  </li>
</ul>
<p>But Muhammad was telling fantasy prophecies that:</p>
<ul>
<li>After an apocalyptic great battle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Malhama_Al-Kubra">Al-Malhama Al-Kubra</a>), Dajjal will appear, and he will go to <strong>all cities</strong> of the world (except Mecca and Medina, where he will not be able to enter). Jews and many others will join his army. </li>
<li>And then Jesus will also appear. And Muslims will still be alive to join his army. And they will kill Dajjal and the Jews. </li>
<li>And then wealth will become abundant, and no one will take Zakat. </li>
<li>And in the last step, the land of Arabia will become meadows and rivers. </li>
</ul>
<p>But these prophecies are false. After the nuclear war, There will be no cities left which could be visited by Dajjal. And no Jews or other people will be left to join Dajjal's army. </p>
<p>Similarly, no Muslims will be left to join the army of Jesus. And no Mecca or Medina will be left. And the whole land of Arabia will be inhabitable for the human race. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>(1) Muhammad's Prophecy: Muslims will be fighting on Horses</h3>
<p>Also, Muhammad says everyone would be fighting on horses instead of using modern stuff such as aeroplanes or nuclear weapons. Just more evidence that Muhammad was making up stories to keep his people interested.</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2899a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sahih Muslim, 2899a</a>:</p>

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">I know their names and the names of their forefathers and the color of their horses. They will be the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day or amongst the best horsemen on the surface of the earth on that day.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Comments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Any sane person will come only to the conclusion that these prophecies are only fantasy stories, and they are not proving Muhammad to be a true prophet, but they are only proving Muhammad to be a false prophet. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reverse is happening in the practical world. Due to the huge power of <strong>Propaganda &amp; Deception</strong> of Islamic preachers, millions of simple Muslims are becoming more steadfast in their belief in Allah/Muhammad, and thousands of non-Muslims are accepting Islam in the name of the so-called true prophecies of Muhammad.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>(2) The prophecy of the land of Arabia becoming meadows and river</h3>
<p>Muslim preachers are today doing non-stop propaganda that the land of Arabia is becoming green after a few rainfalls. But this prophecy is false. </p>
<p>The SEQUENCE of events according to the Hadith is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, there will be an apocalyptic great battle known as Al-Malhama Al-Kubra, which in today's context means a global nuclear war.</li>
<li>Next, Jesus will appear, ushering in an era of long-term reign during which wealth will become abundant.</li>
<li>And the land of Arabia will turn into meadows and rivers only in that era of Jesus.  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:157c">Sahih Muslim, 157c</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying: The Last Hour will not come before wealth becomes abundant and overflowing, so much so that a man takes Zakat out of his property and cannot find anyone to accept it from him and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>till the land of Arabia becomes meadows and rivers</strong></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>And this abundance of wealth will take place during the reign of Jesus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2476">Bukhari, 2476</a>:</p>
<p>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizya tax. Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it (as charitable gifts).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can Islamic preachers directly go to the stage of the land of Arabia becoming meadows, while still neither a great battle has taken place, nor Jesus has come, nor wealth has become abundant?</p>
<p>In the case of nuclear war, all the green spots (which are present today in Saudi Arabia due to wheather change and some rainfall) are going to vanish. And Saudi Arabia is going to become inhabitable for the next thousands of years. </p>
<p>Moreover, see this (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CritiqueIslam/comments/1db25w8/the_prophecy_of_the_greening_of_arabia_is_also/">link</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recent research shows that overall, aridity is increasing throughout the Middle East, including in<span> </span><em>most parts</em><span> </span>of Saudi Arabia. Only one area of Eastern Saudi Arabia is getting comparatively more rainfall compared to previous years and this is not near Mecca/Medina (see Fig 9 -<span> </span><a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a

</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that many regions of Saudi Arabia are getting less rainfall is such that it is actually threatening biodiversity of plants there (<a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a

</li>
<li>
<p>A study done in Saudi Arabia recommends “the necessity of activating water-harvesting projects to make the most of varying rainfall rates, rationalize water consumption”. This is hardly consistent with an abundance of meadows and rivers. (<a rpl="" class="relative pointer-events-auto a

</li>
</ul>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Present-day Muslims have also done some Tehrif (Distortion) in translating this Hadith. They translated the word <span>تَعُودَ as "revert" (i.e. ... </span>till the land of Arabia <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>REVERTS</strong></span> meadows and rivers). By changing this translation, they want to prove a Prophetic Miracle, i.e. modern science showed that the land or Arabia was green several thousand years ago and nobody knew about it. Thus, they claim that it was a miracle of the Prophet and he know about the past state of Arabia through revelation). </p>
<p>However, this prophetic miracle claim is false, while the word <span>تَعُودَ is also used in sense of "becoming" somthing, even if it was not in that state prior.</span><span> Lane's gives the example of "وَدِدْتُ أَنَّ هٰذَا اللَّبَنَ يَعُودُ قَطِرَانًا" which means "I wish that this milk would become tar", which certainly doesn't mean the milk used to be tar. </span></p>
<p>As far as proof of Distortion by present-day Muslims is concerned, then please read the details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210321191244/https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/m60dpl/you_guys_should_know_that_the_hadith_website/">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>(3) Debunking the Euphrates River Hadith</h3>
<p>Another favourite of Islamic preachers is the hadith of the Euphrates River, through which they are deceiving millions of innocent people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2894a">Sahih Muslim, 2894a</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: </strong>The Last Hour would not come before the Euphrates uncovers a mountain of gold, for which people would fight. Ninety-nine out of each one hundred would die but every man amongst them would say that perhaps he would be the one who would be saved (and thus possess this gold).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In another hadith, it has been made clear that 99 out of 100 deaths will take place after the Great Battle (<a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2899a" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sahih Muslim, 2899a</a>). So, do you think that gold will have any value after the Great Nuclear War?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And no mountains of gold have been found in the Euphrates river, but only a small amount. And no one is fighting over it, but companies are extracting it peacefully. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h3 align="left">(4) Buttocks of the Women of Dhi-al-Khalasaa </h3>
<p class="western" align="left">Here is the prophecy: </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western" align="left"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7116">Sahih Bukhari, 7116</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western"><em>Allah's Messenger said, "The Hour will not be established till the </em><em>buttocks of the women of the</em><em> </em><em><strong>tribe of Daus</strong></em><em> </em><em>move while going round (the statue of) </em><em>Dhi-al-Khalasa</em><em>."</em></blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response</strong></span>: </p>
<p>Why would a prophet talk about the <strong>buttocks</strong> of women? In one hadith, Muhammad mentioned "flags in buttocks" [<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1738a">Sahih Muslim 1738a</a>]. Couldn't he just have said that the end times would come when women began to circle around the statue of Dhi-al-Khalasa? Does such language befit a prophet of a divine religion?</p>
<p>Furthermore, this prophecy has proven to be false, as the statue of Dhi-al-Khalasa no longer exists and is not worshiped by anyone. This also implies that if one prophecy in the Hadith is false, none of the other prophecies can be trusted.</p>
<p>However, Islamic Apologists came up with the following proofs, and claimed that the prophecy is indeed true (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401599282909442">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Historian in his work “Akhbār Makkah” witness, In the 1800s, Daws tribe began worshiping and sacrificing to ḏūl ḵhalaṣa, a building with walls and a tree When King ʿAbdul ʿAzīz took control of the Ḥijāz area, he sent military campaign in 1925 to demolish the idol (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401571759800692">source</a>). </p>
<p>Multiple other contemporary Historians witnessed the worshiping of ḏūl ḵhalaṣa including:</p>
<p>(1) Uṯhmān ibn Bishr (1780 - 1871 AD)in his ʿUnwān al-Majd fī Taʾrīkh Najd (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401579108282647">source</a>)</p>
<p>(2) Fawzān al-Sābiq (1859 - 1954 AD) in “al-Bayān wa-al-Ishhār li-kashf zaygh al-mulḥid al-Ḥājj Mukhtār” (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401586548908417">source</a>).</p>
<p>(3) Muḥammad ibn Balīhad An-Najdī (1893 - 1957 AD) in his commentary on Kitāb Ṣifat Jazīratul ʿArab (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401592743956601">source</a>). </p>
<p>(4) <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Multiple other contemporary Historians witnessed the worshiping of ḏūl ḵhalaṣa including, ʿUṯhmān ibn Bishr (1780 - 1871 AD)in his ʿUnwān al-Majd fī Taʾrīkh Najd (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401579108282647">source</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">(5) Even the non-Muslim Historian writes it (<a href="https://twitter.com/AbuKittenTweets/status/1772401599282909442">source</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">And here a video the remains of Dhi-al-Khalasa. </span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Our Response:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Regrettably, Islamists are employing deceptive tactics. The so-called evidence cited is entirely fabricated.</p>
<p><span class="x1lliihq x1plvlek xryxfnj x1n2onr6 x193iq5w xeuugli x1fj9vlw x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1s928wv xhkezso x1gmr53x x1cpjm7i x1fgarty x1943h6x xt4736n x1havqas x1f0sm9e x12qp5cl xzsf02u x1yc453h xudqn12 x3x7a5m">Islamists claimed above that the book "Akhbar Mecca, pp. 381" states: <em>"When King Abd Al Azeez took control of the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hijaz </strong></span>area, he sent military campaigns to subdue tribes and bring them under his control. A campaign was sent to the mountains of Daws in 1925."</em></span></p>
<p><span class="x1lliihq x1plvlek xryxfnj x1n2onr6 x193iq5w xeuugli x1fj9vlw x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1s928wv xhkezso x1gmr53x x1cpjm7i x1fgarty x1943h6x xt4736n x1havqas x1f0sm9e x12qp5cl xzsf02u x1yc453h xudqn12 x3x7a5m">However, there is a significant problem with this claim. </span>The issue is that the Kaba of Dhi-al-Khalasa was not located in the Hijaz area but in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Yemen</strong></span>, a region that was never under the control of King Abd al-Aziz. This factual discrepancy undermines the credibility of the entire claim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4357">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4357</a>:<br>Dhul-l--Khulasa was a house in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Yemen </strong></span>belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka`ba." <strong>Jarir went there, <span style="color: #ff0000;">burnt </span>it with fire and <span style="color: #ff0000;">dismantled </span>it</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, according to the video, this alleged ruin is present in "<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tabalah+Saudi+Arabia/@23.4645774,41.988021,5.48z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x15efb883dbd3efa9:0x6527776b12604571!8m2!3d19.9969372!4d42.2263783!16s%2Fg%2F1x6n4j_w?entry=ttu">Tabalah (Saudi Arabia)</a>", and google maps show that this place is at least 400 km away from the closest border of Yemen. </p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Sahih Bukhari, Jarir, a companion of Prophet Muhammad, set the building ablaze. However, the video shows images of animals etched into the stones, inconsistent with the claim that the structure was burned and dismantled. It's essential to note that numerous pre-Islamic ruins with inscriptions exist throughout the Arabian region, such as the <span class="mw-page-title-main"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir_Hima_Rock_Petroglyphs_and_Inscriptions">Bir Hima Rock Inscriptions</a></span> in Saudi Arabia, featuring similar animal images on stones.</p>
<p>Additionally, why do these images depict animals rather than the supposed statue of Dhi-al-Khalasa?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if this site in Yemen were indeed a major place of pilgrimage, akin to a Kaaba, it would need to support large numbers of visitors. Yet, the small, fragmented remains on top of the hill indicate that the site wasn't designed to handle significant crowds—not even hundreds, let alone thousands. The absence of "flat land" on the hilltop raises doubts about its capacity to host large gatherings. This raises questions about the credibility of claims that it served as a major religious site.</p>
<p>Additionally, if Jarir dismantled the site and then King Abdul Aziz reportedly dismantled it again, how is it possible that remnants of the walls, along with these animal images, are still intact?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Islamic apologists fabricate numerous lies and successfully disseminate them through propaganda, leading millions of innocent people to believe in such prophecies and convert to Islam.</p>

<h3 align="left">(5) Fifty women for one man</h3>

<blockquote class="western"><em>Allah's Messenger said: From among the portents of the Hour are (the following): ... Women will increase in number and men will decrease in number so much so that<span style="color: #ff0000;"> fifty women </span>will be looked after by <span style="color: #0000ff;">one man</span>.</em></blockquote>

<p class="western">Science has already defeated Muhammad. Science has already advanced to that stage where it is fully in a position to avoid any such imbalance of 1 man to 50 women. Actually, science has produced results, which are opposite to Muhammad’s prediction, and the number of women is less than men today.</p>

<h3>(6) When a slave girl gives birth to her master</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="western"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:50">Sahih Bukhari, 50</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">(Allah’s Messenger said: The hour will come) When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.</blockquote>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comments:</span></strong></p>
<p class="western">But the non-religious Western people already defeated Allah and his Qiyyamah, while they all together abolished slavery. Thus, there is no slave woman left to give birth to her master.</p>
<p>An<span style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 400;"> apologist came up with this excuse:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This hadith means that mothers will give birth to children that will enslave them. Like, children being so spoiled to the point they are treating their parents as slaves. Basically, a downfall of morality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A lame excuse, while Muhammad could have simply told it in normal words that a mother (either a slave or a free Woman) would give birth to a child, who would act like a master to her.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That is why none of the Muslims of the last 1400 years ever came up with this meaning of this Hadith, and kept it to slave mothers only, and not to the free Muslim women and their children. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(7) The last hour would come when a young boy in Muhammad's company would die</h3>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>Drawing from the successful strategies employed by Judaism and Christianity, which utilized the concept of the Dajjal and the last hour to instil fear in their followers, Muhammad adopted similar tactics. By invoking the idea of the Dajjal and the last hour, he aimed to ensure the unwavering loyalty of his own followers and prevent any thoughts of disloyalty.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one of his prophecies about the last hour was exposed shortly after his death. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2953b">Sahih Muslim, 2953b</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Anas b. Malik reported that a person asked Allah's Apostle (ﷺ): <span style="font-size: 1rem;">When would the Last Hour come? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) kept quiet for a while. Then looked at a <strong>young boy</strong> in his presence belonging to the tribe of Azd Shanu'a and he said: <strong>If this boy lives he would not grow very old till the Last Hour would come <span style="color: #ff0000;">to you</span></strong>. Anas said that this young boy was of our age during those days.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Muhammad conveyed numerous accounts of the end times to his followers, yet deliberately kept all signs VAGUE and refrained from providing explicit details or specific timelines. But <span style="font-size: 1rem;">he was only a human and he indeed made a mistake in this case</span>, rendering the prophecy time-bound.</p>
<p>Muhammad's companions and later coming Muslim generations also feared the last hour. As a result, this particular forecast gained widespread attention. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">However, soon that young boy (who was mentioned in the Hadith) became old and died too,</span> and the anticipated event of the last hour did not transpire.</p>
<p>In response, followers of Muhammad attempted to justify their leader's error by altering the interpretation of the hadith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6511">Sahih Bukhari, 6511</a>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span class="arabic_sanad arabic">حَدَّثَنِي صَدَقَةُ، أَخْبَرَنَا عَبْدَةُ، عَنْ <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>هِشَامٍ</strong></span>، عَنْ أَبِيهِ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، قَالَتْ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِنَ الأَعْرَابِ جُفَاةً يَأْتُونَ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَيَسْأَلُونَهُ مَتَى السَّاعَةُ، فَكَانَ يَنْظُرُ إِلَى أَصْغَرِهِمْ فَيَقُولُ ‏</span> <span class="arabic_text_details arabic">"‏ إِنْ يَعِشْ هَذَا لاَ يُدْرِكْهُ الْهَرَمُ حَتَّى تَقُومَ عَلَيْكُمْ سَاعَتُكُمْ ‏"</span><span class="arabic_sanad arabic">‏‏.‏ قَالَ هِشَامٌ يَعْنِي مَوْتَهُمْ‏.‏</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Some rough bedouins used to visit the Prophet (ﷺ) and ask him, "When will the Hour be?" He would look at the youngest of all of them and say, "If this should live till he is very old, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>your </strong></span>Hour will take place." <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Hisham </strong></span>(a sub-narrator) said that he meant (by the Hour), their death (i.e. the death of bedouins who asked this question).</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisham_ibn_Urwah">Hisham,</a> the sub-narrator of this hadith, was born 51 years after the demise of Muhammad. It is logical to assume that he outlived the young boy whose advanced age Muhammad referenced as a sign of the approaching final hour in this account.</p>
<p>Given the fact that numerous individuals from Hisham's era would have harbored doubts about Muhammad's prophetic abilities due to this unfulfilled prophecy, it becomes evident that Hisham felt compelled to offer a defense against these criticisms by modifying the narrative.</p>
<p>Moreover, a careful examination of the context in which this hadith was recorded reveals that Hisham's attempt at clarification appears weak and unconvincing. It is reasonable to presume that anyone would be aware of the fact that they will surely pass away before the youngest member of their group reaches old age. Consequently, it seems superfluous for them to pose such an obvious query to Muhammad, and for him to bother responding with information that was already common knowledge.</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Along with the last hour, Muhammad also extensively used the stories about Dajjal to instil fear among his followers, so that they remain faithful to him. Please read our article: <a href="../divine-revelation-or-a-human-drama/19-saf-ibn-sayyad-an-equally-important-incident-as-the-satanic-verses.html">Saf ibn Sayyad (An Equally Important Incident as the Satanic Verses).</a></p>
</div>
<p>Moreover, there is <strong>TEHRIF (Distortion) present in the English translation. </strong></p>
<p>Islamists translate it to: "... the Last Hour would come <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to you</strong></span>".</p>
<p>But there is no "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to you</strong></span>" present in the original Arabic, and it is only a deceptive TEHRIF by Islamists.</p>
<p>Muhammad's way of scaring and keeping his followers in line was to say that judgment day was always around the corner. This is standard practice for cult leaders to introduce a fear that is always coming soon. </p>

<h2>If just one prophecy is incorrect, then it invalidates the entirety of Islam and the remaining 99.99% of prophecies</h2>
<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>Islamic apologists often waste your time by presenting dozens of ambiguous prophecies one after another. They attempt to mislead you by suggesting that these vague predictions contain hidden wisdom or meaning.</p>
<p>To avoid being drawn into this time-consuming trap, use this strategy:</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> If a single prophecy is proven wrong, it undermines the entire foundation of Islam.</p>
<p>Islamic proponents claim that their god, Allah, is infallible, meaning that every prophecy must be accurate. Ask them to address the prophecy about the Last Hour that has been proven false. They will likely evade the question and bombard you with other vague prophecies to distract and confuse you. Don't let them get away with it—hold them accountable, and don't waste your valuable time with their diversions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A LIST of all prophecies in the Quran and the Hadith</h2>

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId513390&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Following Jews and limiting the maximum number of wives to 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polytheists, but democratic Romans were pioneers in ending polygamy, and their influence led to the Christians also abandoning the practice. Similarly, Jews were moving away from polygamy and attempting to restrict it to a maximum of four wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;header_title_text&quot;&gt;Shulchan Aruch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polygamy&amp;amp;oldid=816682321#Judaism&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;header_author_text&quot;&gt;Yosef Karo (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130406020341/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch/Even_ha-Ezer/1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Paragraph 9&lt;/strong&gt; — A man may marry a number of women provided that he has the means to sustain them, and what we find is that the &lt;strong&gt;sages gave worthy suggestion&lt;/strong&gt; that a man marry &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;no more than four women&lt;/span&gt; so that he may fulfill his sexual obligation once a month. &lt;strong&gt;In a place where they are accustomed to only marry one woman they are not permitted to marry another woman&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving in Medina, Muhammad incorporated several Jewish customs to appease the Jewish community. As a result, in the 3rd Hijri year, Muhammad implemented the restriction of having a maximum of four wives, following the revelation of verse 4:3. At that time, Muhammad himself already had four wives: Sawdah, 'Aisha, Hafsa, and Umm Salama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this limitation on the number of wives posed a predicament for Muhammad when he found himself attracted to Zaynab, the wife of his adopted son, after seeing her while she was not properly dressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId537130&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 1st Role of Revelation about Zaynab bint Jahsh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zayd, who was previously a slave, was adopted by Muhammad as his son. Later, Muhammad proposed to his cousin sister Zaynab that she marry Zayd. However, Zaynab expressed her disinterest in the proposal, as she came from a respected family and was considered a beautiful woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Zaynab's refusal, Muhammad promptly claimed to receive a new revelation, which seemed to fulfill his own desire. This revelation implied that Zaynab had no further say in the matter and was compelled to abide by Muhammad's decision, despite her personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.36&quot;&gt;33:36&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Muhammad's success in enforcing Zaynab's marriage to Zayd, their union was plagued by unhappiness. The circumstances deteriorated to such an extent that even Zayd himself desired to end the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20081127160919/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/093.sbt.html&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Zaid bin Haritha came to the Prophet complaining about his wife. The Prophet kept on saying (to him), &quot;Be afraid of Allah and keep your wife.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId637474&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 2nd Role of Revelation when Muhammad fell in love with Zaynab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Zaynab was married to Zaid ibn Haritha, who was adopted by Muhammad as his son. One day, Muhammad went to Zaid's house seeking his counsel on a matter, but Zaid was absent. Unexpectedly, Zaynab, dressed in revealing attire, answered the door. It was at this moment that Muhammad developed a strong attraction towards her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a revelation once again, Muhammad managed to marry Zaynab as his fifth wife, surpassing the earlier limit of four wives. Notably, Muhammad did not give Zaynab the option to consent to the marriage; instead, he claimed that Allah had already decreed their marriage in the heavens. This marriage occurred without Zaynab's consent, without the customary Haq-Mehr (bride price), and without any witnesses present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim historian al-Tabari recorded in his book (&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?id=4A-4ZC4l0dMC&amp;amp;pg=PA2&amp;amp;lpg=PA2&amp;amp;dq=Messenger+of+God,+perhaps+Zaynab+has+excited+your+admiration,+and+so+I+will+separate+myself+from+her.&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=pHGuPqZdDA&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U17cfoJ0NmgkK1QUJl9stKw_yrYtw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwid9oLDkuvgAhUFIVAKHTPmBk8Q6AEwAnoECDAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Messenger%20of%20God%2C%20perhaps%20Zaynab%20has%20excited%20your%20admiration%2C%20and%20so%20I%20will%20separate%20myself%20from%20her.&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of God came to the house of Zayd b. Harithah. (Zayd was always called Zayd b. Muhammad.) Perhaps the Messenger of God missed him at that moment, so as to ask, “Where is Zayd?” He came to his residence to look for him but did not find him. Zaynab bt. Jash, Zayd’s wife, rose to meet him.&lt;strong&gt; Because she was dressed only in a shift, the Messenger of God turned away from her.&lt;/strong&gt; She said: “He is not here, Messenger of God. Come in, you who are as dear to me as my father and mother!” The Messenger of God refused to enter. &lt;strong&gt;Zaynab had dressed in haste&lt;/strong&gt; when she was told “the Messenger of God is at the door.” She jumped up in haste and excited the admiration of the Messenger of God, so that he turned away murmuring something that could scarcely be understood. However, he did say overtly: &lt;strong&gt;“Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!&lt;/strong&gt;” When Zayd came home, his wife told him that the Messenger of God had come to his house. Zayd said, “Why didn’t you ask him to come in?” He replied, “I asked him, but he refused.” “Did you hear him say anything?” he asked. She replied, “As he turned away, I heard him say: ‘Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes hearts to turn!’”&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;So Zayd left, and having come to the Messenger of God, he said: “Messenger of God, I have heard that you came to my house. Why didn’t you go in, you who are as dear to me as my father and mother? Messenger of God, perhaps Zaynab has excited your admiration, and so I will separate myself from her.” Zayd could find no possible way to [approach] her after that day (i.e. to have sex with her). He would come to the Messenger of God and tell him so, but the Messenger of God would say to him, &lt;strong&gt;“Keep your wife.&lt;/strong&gt;” When Zaid mentioned his intention to separate from Zainab to the prophet, &lt;strong&gt;the prophet told him, “Retain thou thy wife” even though the prophet desired that they separate so that he could marry her&lt;/strong&gt;. Zayd separated from her and left her, and she became free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad then claimed the revelation of the following verse, in which he tried to shift the blame from himself to the command of Allah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.37&quot;&gt;Quran 33:37&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;And [remember, O Muhammad], when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed &lt;strong&gt;favor&lt;/strong&gt; and you bestowed &lt;strong&gt;favor&lt;/strong&gt;, &quot;Keep your wife and fear Allah,&quot;&lt;strong&gt; while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him&lt;/strong&gt;. So, when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad, being concerned about public perception, faced several reasons for apprehension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, marrying one's daughter-in-law contradicted the moral standards of that society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, Muhammad's utterance of the phrase &quot;Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!&quot; upon leaving Zaynab was considered inappropriate and shameful, particularly towards his daughter-in-law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, Muhammad already had four wives at that time, and he had previously declared through a revelation that the maximum number of wives allowed was four, including himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Muhammad attempted to resolve and conceal the issue by advising Zayd not to divorce Zaynab. However, the matter eventually became public knowledge, exposing Muhammad's words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing that the issue could no longer be hidden and that his desire for Zaynab persisted, Muhammad resorted to the familiar approach of claiming a &quot;Revelation&quot; in order to take Zaynab as his fifth wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists present an argument that Allah intended to break the custom of prohibiting marriage with the wives of adopted sons during the era of ignorance, using this as a justification for Muhammad marrying Zaynab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Quran itself contradicts this excuse put forth by Islamic apologists. The Quran acknowledges that Muhammad's &lt;strong&gt;primary&lt;/strong&gt; motivation was his personal desire for Zaynab. While the issue of marrying the wives of adopted sons was &lt;strong&gt;secondary&lt;/strong&gt;, Muhammad did not need to carry it out practically. It would have been sufficient for him to communicate it orally, as he did with all other matters such as abstaining from alcohol or avoiding fornication. All of his companions (Sahaba) accepted his verbal instructions, so there was no reason why they would not have accepted his verbal instructions regarding the wives of adopted sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId403413&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 3rd Role of Revelation: Verse 33:38 declares that Allah commanded Muhammad to marry Zaynab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter of Muhammad falling in love with Zaynab raised significant doubts about his prophethood and his character. Its repercussions were so profound that Muhammad found himself resorting to repeated use of revelations to extricate himself from this uncomfortable situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to absolve himself of responsibility for this marriage, Muhammad went a step further and proclaimed that it was Allah who had ordained it upon him, attributing it to his predestined fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.38&quot;&gt;33:38&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;مَّا كَانَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِىِّ مِنْ حَرَجٍ فِيمَا فَرَضَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُۥ ۖ سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ فِى ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا۟ مِن قَبْلُ ۚ وَكَانَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ قَدَرًا مَّقْدُورًا&lt;br&gt;There is not to be upon the Prophet any discomfort concerning that which Allah has imposed upon him. [This is] the established practice of Allah with those [prophets] who have passed on before. And the commandment of Allah is certain destiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId744208&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 4th Role of Revelation: The wedding took place directly in the heavens &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of marriage typically involves several steps, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The man proposing to the woman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The woman accepting the proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreeing upon the Haq-Mehr (bride price).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pronouncing the Nikah (marriage contract) with the consent of both parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having witnesses present to validate the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often followed by a wedding feast or celebration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad's eagerness to marry Zaynab was such that he did not wait for the customary procedures, including obtaining proper consent, settling the Haq-Mehr, or having witnesses present. Instead, he directly entered Zaynab's room, asserting that Allah had already united them in marriage in the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quranexplorer.com/hadithebook/english/index.html?page=Hadith%2Fbukhari%2F009.093.516.html&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Zainab used to boast before the wives of the Prophet and used to say, &quot;You were given in marriage by your families, while I was married (to the Prophet) by Allah from over seven Heavens.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1428b&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;When the 'Iddah of Zainab was over, Allah's Messenger said to Zaid to make a mention to her about him … Zaynab replied (to Zaid about the proposal): I do not do anything until I solicit the will of my Lord. So she stood at her place of worship and the (verse of) the Qur'an (pertaining to her marriage) were revealed, and Allah's Messenger came to her without permission (i.e. he entered her room without permission). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId62999&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 5th Role of Revelation: Declaring Adopted Children are not part of the families &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More verses were then revealed to sweep away any doubt about the lawfulness of the marriage between Mohammed and his adoptive son’s wife. How did it work? That’s pretty simple: every adoption was called off and therefore Zayd’s status changed, from “adoptive son” to “former adoptive son”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.40&quot;&gt;33:40&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;Muhammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and last of the prophets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.4&quot;&gt;33:4&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;Allah has not made for a man two hearts in his interior. And He has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful your mothers. And he has not made your adopted sons your [true] sons. That is [merely] your saying by your mouths, but Allah says the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir says in Tafsir of verse 33:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=4&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar said: &quot;Zayd bin Muhammad, may Allah be pleased with him, the freed servant of the Messenger of Allah was ALWAYS CALLED Zayd bin Muhammad, UNTIL (the words of the) QUR'AN WERE REVEALED …&lt;br&gt;&amp;lt;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;This was also narrated by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa’i. They used to deal with them as sons in every respect, including being alone with them as Mahrams and so on. Hence, Sahlah bint Suhaly, the wife of Abu Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah! We used to call Salim our son, but Allah has revealed what He has revealed. He used to enter upon me, but I feel that Abu Hudhayfah does not like that.&quot; The Prophet said ...&lt;br&gt;((Breastfeed him and he will become your Mahram.))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId782165&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 6th Role of Revelation: Driving people out of his home quickly, so that he could enjoy Zaynab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Muhammad declared that Allah had already united him with Zaynab in celestial matrimony, enabling him to enter Zaynab's quarters directly, without the formalities of a marriage contract or witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, later on, Muhammad organized a marriage feast, known as the Walima. However, as the guests lingered in his house following the meal, Muhammad's desire to be with Zaynab again grew impatient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the guests overstayed their welcome, Muhammad promptly invoked a revelation once more, in order to hasten their departure from his residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.53?context=3&quot;&gt;33:53&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But Allah is not shy of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see this Hadith of Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6238&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;),  in which Anas recounts the aforementioned incident, including the revelation of the verse when people failed to promptly vacate the prophet's house after the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId146250&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 7th Role of Revelation: Making marriage lawful for himself with women who presented themselves as a gift (Arabic: هبة)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having already surpassed the limits of four wives in the case of Zaynab through the aid of revelation, Muhammad became aware of the immense potential these revelations held in fulfilling his desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a captivating woman approached Muhammad and expressed her desire to offer herself as a gift (هبة). As a normal wife, one has some rights like Haq Mahr at the time of Nikah, and then Maintenance Money till she stays as a wife. And then Muhammad had to divide his time equally between them. But the women who gifted themselves to Muhammad, they didn't have any right to anything. In simpler terms, these women were solely intended for sexual services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad found the proposition enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a predicament arose. The restriction of having only four wives still remained, and Muhammad had not explicitly abrogated it for himself in the case of Zaynab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complication emerged as well. 'Aisha and the other wives grew upset following the incident with Zaynab, and they expressed their anger towards Muhammad for taking another wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Muhammad once again invoked revelation, disregarding the limitations of four wives, and declared all women who offered themselves as gifts permissible for him to marry. This time, Muhammad claimed that Quranic verses 33:50 and 33:52 were revealed to justify his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3&quot;&gt;33:50&lt;/a&gt;) …  (O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you) &lt;strong&gt;any believing woman who presents her soul to the Prophet (as a gift)&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;if the Prophet also wishes to wed her&lt;/strong&gt;;- [this is] &lt;strong&gt;only for you [O Muhammad]&lt;/strong&gt;, excluding the [other] believers. We certainly know what We have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess, [but this is for you] &lt;strong&gt;in order that there will be upon you no discomfort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3&quot;&gt;33:51&lt;/a&gt;) …..&lt;br&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3&quot;&gt;33:52&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;strong&gt; Not lawful to you, [O Muhammad], are [any additional] women after [this], nor [is it] for you to exchange them for [other] wives, even if their beauty were to please you&lt;/strong&gt;, except the slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this revelation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, Muhammad freed himself from the limitation of having only four wives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad also cunningly ensured that other Muslim men were denied the opportunity to enjoy women who offered themselves as gifts, reserving such women exclusively for himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another shrewd aspect of this revelation was the condition that Muhammad would only accept those women as gifts whom he found desirable. This meant that if a woman presented herself to Muhammad but did not meet his standards of beauty, he had the full right to reject such individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, Muhammad left the door open for engaging in sexual relations with slave women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To appease his wives, including 'Aisha and the other wives, Muhammad also claimed that verse 33:52 was revealed, which prohibited him from marrying any additional women, even if their beauty pleased him, similar to how he was pleased by Zaynab's beauty and married her earlier. Through this verse, Muhammad conveyed that he would remain with his five permanent wives, along with women who presented themselves as gifts, and slave women. Nevertheless, at a later time, Muhammad abrogated verse 33:52 through the revelation of another verse, allowing him to marry women of all types without any restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his commentary on verse 51 of Surah Al-Ahzab, according to Zamakhshari, he mentions 4 women who gave their bodies to Muhammad for sex (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=2&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=51&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقيل الموهوبات أربع ميمونة بنت الحرث، وزينب بنت خزيمة أمّ المساكين الأنصارية، وأمّ شريك بنت جابر، وخولة بنت حكيم -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that the four women, who gifted themselves to Muhammad, were: Maymunah bint Al-Harith, Zaynab bint Khuzayma (Umm Al-Masakin Al-Ansariyyah), Umm Sharik bint Jabir, and Khawlah bint Hakim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId697995&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The revelation remained absent for an entire month during the allegations against 'Aisha, but miraculously appeared instantly when it came to fulfilling Muhammad's sexual desires.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the presence of verse 33:52, Muhammad's wives, particularly 'Aisha, became enraged when he declared those women who presented themselves as gifts permissible for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Aisha, in particular, expressed her strong displeasure by publicly shaming those women for their actions. Furthermore, she directly criticized Muhammad by sarcastically remarking that Allah promptly fulfills his sexual desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5113&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Khaula bint Hakim was one of those ladies who presented themselves to the Prophet for marriage.&lt;strong&gt; `Aisha said, &quot;Doesn't a lady feel ashamed for presenting herself to a man?&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;But when the Verse: &quot;(O Muhammad) You may postpone (the turn of) any of them (your wives) that you please,' (33.51) was revealed, &quot; &lt;strong&gt;`Aisha said, 'O Allah's Messenger! I do not see, but this, that your Lord hurries in pleasing you&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(by sending revelations quickly on the spot)&lt;/strong&gt;' &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proves that even ‘Aisha knew very well that Muhammad was making those revelations on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId817474&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 8th Role of Revelation: Muhammad made all types of women permissible for him to marry without any restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad first limited himself to 4 wives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But then he added Zaynab as his 5th wife. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then he added those women who presented themselves as a gift to him. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But later he made all women lawful for him to marry and without any limits of any number (i.e. he abrogated verse 33:52 too). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, with Muhammad's rise to power in Medina, verse 33:52 remained an obstacle for him to pursue other women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Muhammad once again employed the familiar tactic of revelation and effectively abrogated verse 33:52 by claiming the revelation of a different verse. It is noteworthy that through this revelation, Muhammad seemingly manipulated and exerted control over his wives, coercing them to find contentment with what little he provided them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3&quot;&gt;33:51&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;You, [O Muhammad], may put aside (from your wives) whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will.&lt;/strong&gt; And any that you desire of those [wives] from whom you had [temporarily] separated - there is no blame upon you [in returning her]. &lt;strong&gt;That is more suitable that your wives should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them - all of them.&lt;/strong&gt; And Allah knows what is in your heart. And ever is Allah Knowing and Forbearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware that according to Muslim Quran Interpreters, verse 33:52 was originally revealed before verse 33:51, despite the current arrangement in the Quran where they appear in the opposite order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ibn Kathir's account, Umm Salama, another wife of Muhammad, confirms that all types of women became permissible for Muhammad to marry without any restrictions on the number. Additionally, Ibn Kathir documents that verse 33:52 was revealed prior to verse 33:51, as noted in his commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=52&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;33:52&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قال الإمام أحمد حدثنا سفيان عن عمرو عن عطاء عن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت ما مات رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم حتى أحل الله له النساء، ورواه أيضاً من حديث ابن جريج عن عطاء عن عبيد بن عمير عن عائشة، ورواه الترمذي والنسائي في سننيهما، وقال ابن أبي حاتم حدثنا أبو زرعة، حدثنا عبد الرحمن بن عبد الملك بن شيبة، حدثني عمر بن أبي بكر، حدثني المغيرة بن عبد الرحمن الحزامي عن أبي النضر مولى عمر بن عبيد الله عن عبد الله بن وهب بن زمعة عن أم سلمة أنها قالت لم يمت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم حتى أحل الله له أن يتزوج من النساء ما شاء، إلا ذات محرم، وذلك قول الله تعالى { تُرْجِى مَن تَشَآءُ مِنْهُنَّ } الآية، فجعلت هذه ناسخة للتي بعدها في التلاوة كآيتي عدة الوفاة في البقرة، الأولى ناسخة للتي بعدها، والله أعلم&lt;br&gt;‘Aisha said that Allah permitted him to marry whatever women he wanted before his death. Same is also narrated by Umm Salama. And the verse which is making women lawful to him is 33:51, which is although present earlier than verse 33:52, but it was revealed later than 33:52. This same thing happened in Surah Baqara too, where the new verse which is abrogating the older verse of Iddah (waiting period) is present earlier in order than the one which was abrogated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, with the revelation of verse 33:51, all restrictions were lifted, granting Muhammad the freedom to marry women in any quantity. This served as the pathway for Muhammad's journey from having four wives to eventually having nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this development, Muhammad married Juwayriyyah, Ramlah (Umm Habiba), Safiyyah, Maymunah, and various others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId218576&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 9th Role of Revelation: Muhammad found a way to get rid of his old wife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Muhammad grew stronger and wealthier in Medina, he began marrying multiple young and beautiful women, despite his own age ranging between 58 and 63 years. The women he married were generally between the ages of 17 and 35, making Muhammad double, triple, or even four times their age. Islamic traditions highlight that these women, such as Juwayria, Safiyyah, Rehana, Zaynab, and Umm Habiba, were not only young but also exceptionally beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sawdah was the only wife of Muhammad who was older than the newlywed ladies, though still younger than Muhammad himself. In the presence of his young and attractive wives, Muhammad desired to part ways with Sawdah. Muhammad had married Sawdah in Mecca during a time of weakness and poverty when he faced opposition from the entire city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fulfill his wish of separating from Sawdah, Muhammad once again invoked revelation and claimed that Allah had sent the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.51&quot;&gt;33:51&lt;/a&gt;) You, [O Muhammad], may put aside whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, after the revelation of this verse, the only wife whom Muhammad chose to divorce, was the old lady Sawdah. It was despite the fact that Sawdah was serving Muhammad from the time of Mecca, when Muhammad was poor and weak, while other wives were new, and they hardly lived with Muhammad for a few years in Medina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daaiyatulislam.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/tafsir-ibn-kathir-surah-4-an-nisa.pdf&quot;&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Verse 4:128)&lt;/a&gt;, upon learning of Muhammad's intention to divorce her, Sawdah sought refuge in 'Aisha's house. When Muhammad arrived, Sawdah expressed her willingness to give up her turn to 'Aisha but pleaded with him not to divorce her. Muhammad readily agreed and promptly claimed the revelation of the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.128?context=3&quot;&gt;4:128-129&lt;/a&gt;) And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them (i.e. woman agrees upon leaving some of her rights) … &lt;strong&gt;And you will never be able to do Justice (Arabic: تَعْدِلُوْا) between wives&lt;/strong&gt;, even if you should strive [to do so].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, do you notice the contradiction? Previously, the author of the Quran (Muhammad) had established the condition of justice ('adl) for having multiple wives (Quran 4:3). However, in this particular verse (Quran 4:128-129), he permits a husband to manipulate his wives by threatening divorce, thus pressuring them into relinquishing their rights in the name of a settlement. This undermines the requirement of justice, as the husband retains control over the right to divorce, resulting in settlements that consistently favor him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.3&quot;&gt;Quran 4:3&lt;/a&gt;) If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, Two or three or four;&lt;strong&gt; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one&lt;/strong&gt;, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, the verse (Quran 4:128-129) has abrogated the verse of doing justice among multiple wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse, about usurping the rights of women by blackmailing them, is the base upon which the institution of Misyaar marriage is constructed. And women are openly abused in Misyaar marriage in Arab countries (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8EB1JHNaDIM&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId814888&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 10th Role of Revelation: Muhammad deprived his wives of the right to equal time and their turns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 4:3, Muhammad initially established the condition that husbands must divide their time equally among their four wives, ensuring each wife had her designated turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he later invoked verse 33:51 to completely exempt himself from this condition, without seeking any consent from his wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the commentary of verse &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wordofallah.com/tafseer&quot;&gt;33:51&lt;/a&gt;, Ibn Kathir writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{ تُرْجِى مَن تَشَآءُ مِنْهُنَّ } الآية، أي من أزواجك، لا حرج عليك أن تترك القسم لهن، فتقدم من شئت، وتؤخر من شئت، وتجامع من شئت، وتترك من شئت، هكذا يروى عن ابن عباس ومجاهد والحسن وقتادة وأبي رزين وعبد الرحمن بن زيد بن أسلم وغيرهم&lt;br&gt;Allah’s saying in Quran (i.e. &lt;em&gt;You can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them&lt;/em&gt;,) means, 'your wives:&lt;strong&gt; there is no sin on you if you stop dividing your time equally between them, and delay the turn of one of them and bring forward the turn of another as you wish, and you have intercourse with one and not another as you wish&lt;/strong&gt;.' This was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Abu Razin, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, not only Sawdah but all of Muhammad's wives lost their entitlement to equal time and turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId513528&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 11th Role of Revelation: Making slave-woman Mariyah again lawful for himself (for sexual intercourse) through the Revelation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad had 9 wives and 21 slave women (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fislamweb.net%2Far%2Flibrary%2Findex.php%3Fpage%3Dbookcontents%26flag%3D1%26bk_no%3D59%26ID%3D588%26fbclid%3DIwAR32OPC0qxmnE67UL8QKzZUyio3UbtCuEuPJZPuAQycRwaiMiQzjf87eNhw&amp;amp;h=AT0VXXder0Xm9MvJwtNOXYDSpYnASNbTDGl-A1KrrlsoO016tRr4e2Jvkeo2KUV5C2mh8i_ZUAdbKvKKL46q1tdRUcN55bXSjlcpCUiOx-Ha9wAgdCzJ7e_IjJjKVAluWqia7yLZS6X58C3G0fT3&amp;amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;amp;c%5B0%5D=AT0jwI-yqfL27Fowu4QlA5V-_ULhwb4ksbCJPAhDGeK4Qu-UDL99Y4CBX71OwUSKjctmu8AcL7LVq9es_ReMnFqwlxHWFXao11LL3x2gEjP7BzRyVkgTq-xHA8R5V7k_mkXLrPTg4gVa-jf6axWWjHpe0V9sR0G1sbw&quot;&gt;Ibn Kathir&lt;/a&gt;). One of them was Maria. She was a beautiful lady, and 'Aisha was jealous of her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maulana Maudodi recorded in his Tafhim under the commentary of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tafheemulquran.net/1_Tafheem/0_Tafheem.html&quot;&gt;66:1&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hafidh Ibn Hajr recorded this saying of Hadirhat 'Aisha in his book al-Asaba: &quot;The arrival of any other wife of the prophet did not displease me as much as the arrival of Maria did, because she was beautiful and charming, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) was very fond of her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad followed a rotational schedule to visit each of his wives. On one such occasion, it was Hafsa's turn, but she had temporarily left to visit her father. Upon her return, Hafsa discovered Muhammad engaged in sexual relations with his slave woman, Maria, in her room. This incident deeply upset Hafsa, prompting Muhammad to swear an oath to refrain from further relations with Maria in order to regain Hafsa's happiness. However, Muhammad requested that Hafsa keep this matter confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Hafsa shared the incident with 'Aisha, and it is possible that 'Aisha later observed Muhammad breaking his promise by continuing a discreet relationship with Maria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959&quot;&gt;Sunan Nisai, Hadith 3959&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: &quot;O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: Sahih&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (authentic)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to that, Muhammad's anger surged, prompting him to assert the revelation of the following verses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/66.1?context=5&quot;&gt;66:1-4&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;O Prophet, why do you forbid what Allah has made lawful for you? Is it to please your wives? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. &lt;strong&gt;Allah has prescribed for you a way for the absolution of your oaths (i.e. the Prophet can make Mariyah permissible again for himself through this process)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;And Allah is your protector, and He is the Knowing, the Wise. And [remember] when the Prophet confided to one of his wives a statement; and when she informed [another] of it and Allah showed it to him, he made known part of it and ignored a part. And when he informed her about it, she said, &quot;Who told you this?&quot; He said, &quot;I was informed by the Knowing, the Acquainted.&quot; If you two [wives] repent to Allah, [it is best], for your hearts have deviated. &lt;strong&gt;But if you cooperate against him - then indeed Allah is his protector, and Gabriel and the righteous of the believers and the angels, moreover, are [his] assistants&lt;/strong&gt;. Perhaps his Lord,&lt;strong&gt; if he divorced you [all], would substitute for him wives better than you - submitting [to Allah], believing, devoutly obedient, repentant, worshipping, and traveling - [ones] previously married and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;virgins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Muhammad achieved the following goals through this revelation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He succeeded in making beautiful and young Mariyah again permissible for him. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He succeeded in threatening his wives so that they feared him and never dared to criticize and put any restrictions on his sexual activities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also taunted them that they were not VIRGINGS. Also, the threat was that Muhammad could divorce all of them and would get a lot more new wives who were better than them in every regard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId60769&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad also had four concubines with whom he engaged in sexual relations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn al-Qayyim recorded in his book Zaad al-Ma’aad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220509160304/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=21&amp;amp;idto=21&amp;amp;bk_no=127&amp;amp;ID=23&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قال أبو عبيدة : كان له أربع : مارية وهي أم ولده إبراهيم ، وريحانة وجارية أخرى جميلة أصابها في بعض السبي ، وجارية وهبتها له &lt;span class=&quot;names&quot;&gt;زينب بنت جحش &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu ‘Ubaydah said: He had four (concubines): Mariyah, who was the mother of his son Ibraaheem; Rayhaanah; another beautiful slave woman whom he acquired as a prisoner of war; and a slave woman who was given to him by Zaynab bint Jahsh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210211034055/https://answering-islam.org/Shamoun/mary_concubine.htm&quot;&gt;Please read more details here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Muhammad's living quarters were limited as he had a small house attached to the mosque. Due to the lack of space, there was no room for additional concubines. However, on one occasion, Muhammad engaged in sexual relations with Mariyah in Hafsa's room. Hafsa unexpectedly returned and discovered them together. This incident ignited her anger, leading her to inform Aisha as well. Consequently, both Hafsa and Aisha prevented Muhammad from being alone with Maria, prompting Muhammad to make a solemn oath not to have sexual relations with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959&quot;&gt;Sunan Nisai, Hadith 3959&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: &quot;O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: Sahih&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (authentic)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId938882&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;16 Special Privileges, which Muhammad reserved for himself through Revelation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Qurtubi is a famous Quranic Scholar. He lists those 16 special privileges, which Muhammad reserved only for himself through revelation, including the right to take another man’s wife if he so desired:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First: To be fair with the spoils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second: To (forcefully) take a fifth of a fifth or just a fifth (of the spoils of war).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third: &quot;Al Wisal&quot; (Dimitrius- the fast or fasting. This usually refers to fasting or abstaining from food.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth: To take more than four women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifth: To marry, &quot;Yas-tan-kih&quot; (or have intercourse), with a woman who verbally pronounces her dedication (to the prophet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sixth: To marry, &quot;Yas-tan-kih,&quot; without the presence (or permission) of a legal guardian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seventh: To marry, &quot;Yas-tan-kih,&quot; without a dowry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eighth: To marry (and have intercourse) during a state of ritual consecration and purification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ninth: The annulment of an oath he may make to his wives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenth: If Muhammad looks at a woman (and desires her) THEN IT IS NECESSARY FOR HER HUSBAND TO DIVORCE HER AND FOR MUHAMMAD TO MARRY HER. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ibn Al A’raby said, &quot;This is what the servant of the two holy mosques has also said, as was clear to the scholars FROM THE STORY OF ZAID which also had this meaning.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eleventh: That the prophet released Safiyyah (from her captured status) and he considered her release as her dowry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twelfth: To enter Mecca without being in a state of ritual purification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirteenth: To fight in Mecca.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourteenth: That he is not inherited by anyone at all. This was mentioned in the oath of absolution for when a man approaches death due to illness, most of his possessions are taken away, so that he does not have more than a third left for him. But the possessions of the prophet remained for him, as is evidenced in the verse of inheritance and in Surat Mariam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifteenth: His marriage is still considered effective after his death (i.e. his widows were not allowed to marry any other man after him).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sixteenth: If he divorces a woman, she remains prohibited to everyone and may not be married, to someone else.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polytheists, but democratic Romans were pioneers in ending polygamy, and their influence led to the Christians also abandoning the practice. Similarly, Jews were moving away from polygamy and attempting to restrict it to a maximum of four wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;header_title_text&quot;&gt;Shulchan Aruch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polygamy&amp;amp;oldid=816682321#Judaism&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;header_author_text&quot;&gt;Yosef Karo (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130406020341/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch/Even_ha-Ezer/1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Paragraph 9&lt;/strong&gt; — A man may marry a number of women provided that he has the means to sustain them, and what we find is that the &lt;strong&gt;sages gave worthy suggestion&lt;/strong&gt; that a man marry &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;no more than four women&lt;/span&gt; so that he may fulfill his sexual obligation once a month. &lt;strong&gt;In a place where they are accustomed to only marry one woman they are not permitted to marry another woman&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving in Medina, Muhammad incorporated several Jewish customs to appease the Jewish community. As a result, in the 3rd Hijri year, Muhammad implemented the restriction of having a maximum of four wives, following the revelation of verse 4:3. At that time, Muhammad himself already had four wives: Sawdah, 'Aisha, Hafsa, and Umm Salama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this limitation on the number of wives posed a predicament for Muhammad when he found himself attracted to Zaynab, the wife of his adopted son, after seeing her while she was not properly dressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId537130&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 1st Role of Revelation about Zaynab bint Jahsh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zayd, who was previously a slave, was adopted by Muhammad as his son. Later, Muhammad proposed to his cousin sister Zaynab that she marry Zayd. However, Zaynab expressed her disinterest in the proposal, as she came from a respected family and was considered a beautiful woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Zaynab's refusal, Muhammad promptly claimed to receive a new revelation, which seemed to fulfill his own desire. This revelation implied that Zaynab had no further say in the matter and was compelled to abide by Muhammad's decision, despite her personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.36&quot;&gt;33:36&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Muhammad's success in enforcing Zaynab's marriage to Zayd, their union was plagued by unhappiness. The circumstances deteriorated to such an extent that even Zayd himself desired to end the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20081127160919/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/093.sbt.html&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Zaid bin Haritha came to the Prophet complaining about his wife. The Prophet kept on saying (to him), &quot;Be afraid of Allah and keep your wife.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId637474&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 2nd Role of Revelation when Muhammad fell in love with Zaynab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Zaynab was married to Zaid ibn Haritha, who was adopted by Muhammad as his son. One day, Muhammad went to Zaid's house seeking his counsel on a matter, but Zaid was absent. Unexpectedly, Zaynab, dressed in revealing attire, answered the door. It was at this moment that Muhammad developed a strong attraction towards her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a revelation once again, Muhammad managed to marry Zaynab as his fifth wife, surpassing the earlier limit of four wives. Notably, Muhammad did not give Zaynab the option to consent to the marriage; instead, he claimed that Allah had already decreed their marriage in the heavens. This marriage occurred without Zaynab's consent, without the customary Haq-Mehr (bride price), and without any witnesses present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim historian al-Tabari recorded in his book (&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?id=4A-4ZC4l0dMC&amp;amp;pg=PA2&amp;amp;lpg=PA2&amp;amp;dq=Messenger+of+God,+perhaps+Zaynab+has+excited+your+admiration,+and+so+I+will+separate+myself+from+her.&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=pHGuPqZdDA&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U17cfoJ0NmgkK1QUJl9stKw_yrYtw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwid9oLDkuvgAhUFIVAKHTPmBk8Q6AEwAnoECDAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Messenger%20of%20God%2C%20perhaps%20Zaynab%20has%20excited%20your%20admiration%2C%20and%20so%20I%20will%20separate%20myself%20from%20her.&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of God came to the house of Zayd b. Harithah. (Zayd was always called Zayd b. Muhammad.) Perhaps the Messenger of God missed him at that moment, so as to ask, “Where is Zayd?” He came to his residence to look for him but did not find him. Zaynab bt. Jash, Zayd’s wife, rose to meet him.&lt;strong&gt; Because she was dressed only in a shift, the Messenger of God turned away from her.&lt;/strong&gt; She said: “He is not here, Messenger of God. Come in, you who are as dear to me as my father and mother!” The Messenger of God refused to enter. &lt;strong&gt;Zaynab had dressed in haste&lt;/strong&gt; when she was told “the Messenger of God is at the door.” She jumped up in haste and excited the admiration of the Messenger of God, so that he turned away murmuring something that could scarcely be understood. However, he did say overtly: &lt;strong&gt;“Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!&lt;/strong&gt;” When Zayd came home, his wife told him that the Messenger of God had come to his house. Zayd said, “Why didn’t you ask him to come in?” He replied, “I asked him, but he refused.” “Did you hear him say anything?” he asked. She replied, “As he turned away, I heard him say: ‘Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes hearts to turn!’”&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;So Zayd left, and having come to the Messenger of God, he said: “Messenger of God, I have heard that you came to my house. Why didn’t you go in, you who are as dear to me as my father and mother? Messenger of God, perhaps Zaynab has excited your admiration, and so I will separate myself from her.” Zayd could find no possible way to [approach] her after that day (i.e. to have sex with her). He would come to the Messenger of God and tell him so, but the Messenger of God would say to him, &lt;strong&gt;“Keep your wife.&lt;/strong&gt;” When Zaid mentioned his intention to separate from Zainab to the prophet, &lt;strong&gt;the prophet told him, “Retain thou thy wife” even though the prophet desired that they separate so that he could marry her&lt;/strong&gt;. Zayd separated from her and left her, and she became free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad then claimed the revelation of the following verse, in which he tried to shift the blame from himself to the command of Allah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.37&quot;&gt;Quran 33:37&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;And [remember, O Muhammad], when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed &lt;strong&gt;favor&lt;/strong&gt; and you bestowed &lt;strong&gt;favor&lt;/strong&gt;, &quot;Keep your wife and fear Allah,&quot;&lt;strong&gt; while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him&lt;/strong&gt;. So, when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad, being concerned about public perception, faced several reasons for apprehension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, marrying one's daughter-in-law contradicted the moral standards of that society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, Muhammad's utterance of the phrase &quot;Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!&quot; upon leaving Zaynab was considered inappropriate and shameful, particularly towards his daughter-in-law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, Muhammad already had four wives at that time, and he had previously declared through a revelation that the maximum number of wives allowed was four, including himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Muhammad attempted to resolve and conceal the issue by advising Zayd not to divorce Zaynab. However, the matter eventually became public knowledge, exposing Muhammad's words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing that the issue could no longer be hidden and that his desire for Zaynab persisted, Muhammad resorted to the familiar approach of claiming a &quot;Revelation&quot; in order to take Zaynab as his fifth wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists present an argument that Allah intended to break the custom of prohibiting marriage with the wives of adopted sons during the era of ignorance, using this as a justification for Muhammad marrying Zaynab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Quran itself contradicts this excuse put forth by Islamic apologists. The Quran acknowledges that Muhammad's &lt;strong&gt;primary&lt;/strong&gt; motivation was his personal desire for Zaynab. While the issue of marrying the wives of adopted sons was &lt;strong&gt;secondary&lt;/strong&gt;, Muhammad did not need to carry it out practically. It would have been sufficient for him to communicate it orally, as he did with all other matters such as abstaining from alcohol or avoiding fornication. All of his companions (Sahaba) accepted his verbal instructions, so there was no reason why they would not have accepted his verbal instructions regarding the wives of adopted sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId403413&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 3rd Role of Revelation: Verse 33:38 declares that Allah commanded Muhammad to marry Zaynab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter of Muhammad falling in love with Zaynab raised significant doubts about his prophethood and his character. Its repercussions were so profound that Muhammad found himself resorting to repeated use of revelations to extricate himself from this uncomfortable situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to absolve himself of responsibility for this marriage, Muhammad went a step further and proclaimed that it was Allah who had ordained it upon him, attributing it to his predestined fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.38&quot;&gt;33:38&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;مَّا كَانَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِىِّ مِنْ حَرَجٍ فِيمَا فَرَضَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُۥ ۖ سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ فِى ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا۟ مِن قَبْلُ ۚ وَكَانَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ قَدَرًا مَّقْدُورًا&lt;br&gt;There is not to be upon the Prophet any discomfort concerning that which Allah has imposed upon him. [This is] the established practice of Allah with those [prophets] who have passed on before. And the commandment of Allah is certain destiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId744208&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 4th Role of Revelation: The wedding took place directly in the heavens &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of marriage typically involves several steps, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The man proposing to the woman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The woman accepting the proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreeing upon the Haq-Mehr (bride price).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pronouncing the Nikah (marriage contract) with the consent of both parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having witnesses present to validate the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often followed by a wedding feast or celebration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad's eagerness to marry Zaynab was such that he did not wait for the customary procedures, including obtaining proper consent, settling the Haq-Mehr, or having witnesses present. Instead, he directly entered Zaynab's room, asserting that Allah had already united them in marriage in the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quranexplorer.com/hadithebook/english/index.html?page=Hadith%2Fbukhari%2F009.093.516.html&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Zainab used to boast before the wives of the Prophet and used to say, &quot;You were given in marriage by your families, while I was married (to the Prophet) by Allah from over seven Heavens.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1428b&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;When the 'Iddah of Zainab was over, Allah's Messenger said to Zaid to make a mention to her about him … Zaynab replied (to Zaid about the proposal): I do not do anything until I solicit the will of my Lord. So she stood at her place of worship and the (verse of) the Qur'an (pertaining to her marriage) were revealed, and Allah's Messenger came to her without permission (i.e. he entered her room without permission). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId62999&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 5th Role of Revelation: Declaring Adopted Children are not part of the families &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More verses were then revealed to sweep away any doubt about the lawfulness of the marriage between Mohammed and his adoptive son’s wife. How did it work? That’s pretty simple: every adoption was called off and therefore Zayd’s status changed, from “adoptive son” to “former adoptive son”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.40&quot;&gt;33:40&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;Muhammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and last of the prophets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.4&quot;&gt;33:4&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;Allah has not made for a man two hearts in his interior. And He has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful your mothers. And he has not made your adopted sons your [true] sons. That is [merely] your saying by your mouths, but Allah says the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir says in Tafsir of verse 33:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=4&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar said: &quot;Zayd bin Muhammad, may Allah be pleased with him, the freed servant of the Messenger of Allah was ALWAYS CALLED Zayd bin Muhammad, UNTIL (the words of the) QUR'AN WERE REVEALED …&lt;br&gt;&amp;lt;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;This was also narrated by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa’i. They used to deal with them as sons in every respect, including being alone with them as Mahrams and so on. Hence, Sahlah bint Suhaly, the wife of Abu Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah! We used to call Salim our son, but Allah has revealed what He has revealed. He used to enter upon me, but I feel that Abu Hudhayfah does not like that.&quot; The Prophet said ...&lt;br&gt;((Breastfeed him and he will become your Mahram.))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId782165&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 6th Role of Revelation: Driving people out of his home quickly, so that he could enjoy Zaynab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Muhammad declared that Allah had already united him with Zaynab in celestial matrimony, enabling him to enter Zaynab's quarters directly, without the formalities of a marriage contract or witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, later on, Muhammad organized a marriage feast, known as the Walima. However, as the guests lingered in his house following the meal, Muhammad's desire to be with Zaynab again grew impatient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the guests overstayed their welcome, Muhammad promptly invoked a revelation once more, in order to hasten their departure from his residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.53?context=3&quot;&gt;33:53&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But Allah is not shy of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see this Hadith of Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6238&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;),  in which Anas recounts the aforementioned incident, including the revelation of the verse when people failed to promptly vacate the prophet's house after the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId146250&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 7th Role of Revelation: Making marriage lawful for himself with women who presented themselves as a gift (Arabic: هبة)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having already surpassed the limits of four wives in the case of Zaynab through the aid of revelation, Muhammad became aware of the immense potential these revelations held in fulfilling his desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a captivating woman approached Muhammad and expressed her desire to offer herself as a gift (هبة). As a normal wife, one has some rights like Haq Mahr at the time of Nikah, and then Maintenance Money till she stays as a wife. And then Muhammad had to divide his time equally between them. But the women who gifted themselves to Muhammad, they didn't have any right to anything. In simpler terms, these women were solely intended for sexual services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad found the proposition enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a predicament arose. The restriction of having only four wives still remained, and Muhammad had not explicitly abrogated it for himself in the case of Zaynab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complication emerged as well. 'Aisha and the other wives grew upset following the incident with Zaynab, and they expressed their anger towards Muhammad for taking another wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Muhammad once again invoked revelation, disregarding the limitations of four wives, and declared all women who offered themselves as gifts permissible for him to marry. This time, Muhammad claimed that Quranic verses 33:50 and 33:52 were revealed to justify his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3&quot;&gt;33:50&lt;/a&gt;) …  (O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you) &lt;strong&gt;any believing woman who presents her soul to the Prophet (as a gift)&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;if the Prophet also wishes to wed her&lt;/strong&gt;;- [this is] &lt;strong&gt;only for you [O Muhammad]&lt;/strong&gt;, excluding the [other] believers. We certainly know what We have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess, [but this is for you] &lt;strong&gt;in order that there will be upon you no discomfort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3&quot;&gt;33:51&lt;/a&gt;) …..&lt;br&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3&quot;&gt;33:52&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;strong&gt; Not lawful to you, [O Muhammad], are [any additional] women after [this], nor [is it] for you to exchange them for [other] wives, even if their beauty were to please you&lt;/strong&gt;, except the slave women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this revelation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, Muhammad freed himself from the limitation of having only four wives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad also cunningly ensured that other Muslim men were denied the opportunity to enjoy women who offered themselves as gifts, reserving such women exclusively for himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another shrewd aspect of this revelation was the condition that Muhammad would only accept those women as gifts whom he found desirable. This meant that if a woman presented herself to Muhammad but did not meet his standards of beauty, he had the full right to reject such individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, Muhammad left the door open for engaging in sexual relations with slave women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To appease his wives, including 'Aisha and the other wives, Muhammad also claimed that verse 33:52 was revealed, which prohibited him from marrying any additional women, even if their beauty pleased him, similar to how he was pleased by Zaynab's beauty and married her earlier. Through this verse, Muhammad conveyed that he would remain with his five permanent wives, along with women who presented themselves as gifts, and slave women. Nevertheless, at a later time, Muhammad abrogated verse 33:52 through the revelation of another verse, allowing him to marry women of all types without any restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his commentary on verse 51 of Surah Al-Ahzab, according to Zamakhshari, he mentions 4 women who gave their bodies to Muhammad for sex (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=2&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=51&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقيل الموهوبات أربع ميمونة بنت الحرث، وزينب بنت خزيمة أمّ المساكين الأنصارية، وأمّ شريك بنت جابر، وخولة بنت حكيم -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that the four women, who gifted themselves to Muhammad, were: Maymunah bint Al-Harith, Zaynab bint Khuzayma (Umm Al-Masakin Al-Ansariyyah), Umm Sharik bint Jabir, and Khawlah bint Hakim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId697995&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The revelation remained absent for an entire month during the allegations against 'Aisha, but miraculously appeared instantly when it came to fulfilling Muhammad's sexual desires.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the presence of verse 33:52, Muhammad's wives, particularly 'Aisha, became enraged when he declared those women who presented themselves as gifts permissible for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Aisha, in particular, expressed her strong displeasure by publicly shaming those women for their actions. Furthermore, she directly criticized Muhammad by sarcastically remarking that Allah promptly fulfills his sexual desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5113&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Khaula bint Hakim was one of those ladies who presented themselves to the Prophet for marriage.&lt;strong&gt; `Aisha said, &quot;Doesn't a lady feel ashamed for presenting herself to a man?&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;But when the Verse: &quot;(O Muhammad) You may postpone (the turn of) any of them (your wives) that you please,' (33.51) was revealed, &quot; &lt;strong&gt;`Aisha said, 'O Allah's Messenger! I do not see, but this, that your Lord hurries in pleasing you&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(by sending revelations quickly on the spot)&lt;/strong&gt;' &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proves that even ‘Aisha knew very well that Muhammad was making those revelations on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId817474&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 8th Role of Revelation: Muhammad made all types of women permissible for him to marry without any restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad first limited himself to 4 wives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But then he added Zaynab as his 5th wife. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then he added those women who presented themselves as a gift to him. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But later he made all women lawful for him to marry and without any limits of any number (i.e. he abrogated verse 33:52 too). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, with Muhammad's rise to power in Medina, verse 33:52 remained an obstacle for him to pursue other women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Muhammad once again employed the familiar tactic of revelation and effectively abrogated verse 33:52 by claiming the revelation of a different verse. It is noteworthy that through this revelation, Muhammad seemingly manipulated and exerted control over his wives, coercing them to find contentment with what little he provided them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.50?context=3&quot;&gt;33:51&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;You, [O Muhammad], may put aside (from your wives) whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will.&lt;/strong&gt; And any that you desire of those [wives] from whom you had [temporarily] separated - there is no blame upon you [in returning her]. &lt;strong&gt;That is more suitable that your wives should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them - all of them.&lt;/strong&gt; And Allah knows what is in your heart. And ever is Allah Knowing and Forbearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware that according to Muslim Quran Interpreters, verse 33:52 was originally revealed before verse 33:51, despite the current arrangement in the Quran where they appear in the opposite order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ibn Kathir's account, Umm Salama, another wife of Muhammad, confirms that all types of women became permissible for Muhammad to marry without any restrictions on the number. Additionally, Ibn Kathir documents that verse 33:52 was revealed prior to verse 33:51, as noted in his commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=33&amp;amp;tAyahNo=52&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;33:52&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قال الإمام أحمد حدثنا سفيان عن عمرو عن عطاء عن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت ما مات رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم حتى أحل الله له النساء، ورواه أيضاً من حديث ابن جريج عن عطاء عن عبيد بن عمير عن عائشة، ورواه الترمذي والنسائي في سننيهما، وقال ابن أبي حاتم حدثنا أبو زرعة، حدثنا عبد الرحمن بن عبد الملك بن شيبة، حدثني عمر بن أبي بكر، حدثني المغيرة بن عبد الرحمن الحزامي عن أبي النضر مولى عمر بن عبيد الله عن عبد الله بن وهب بن زمعة عن أم سلمة أنها قالت لم يمت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم حتى أحل الله له أن يتزوج من النساء ما شاء، إلا ذات محرم، وذلك قول الله تعالى { تُرْجِى مَن تَشَآءُ مِنْهُنَّ } الآية، فجعلت هذه ناسخة للتي بعدها في التلاوة كآيتي عدة الوفاة في البقرة، الأولى ناسخة للتي بعدها، والله أعلم&lt;br&gt;‘Aisha said that Allah permitted him to marry whatever women he wanted before his death. Same is also narrated by Umm Salama. And the verse which is making women lawful to him is 33:51, which is although present earlier than verse 33:52, but it was revealed later than 33:52. This same thing happened in Surah Baqara too, where the new verse which is abrogating the older verse of Iddah (waiting period) is present earlier in order than the one which was abrogated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, with the revelation of verse 33:51, all restrictions were lifted, granting Muhammad the freedom to marry women in any quantity. This served as the pathway for Muhammad's journey from having four wives to eventually having nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this development, Muhammad married Juwayriyyah, Ramlah (Umm Habiba), Safiyyah, Maymunah, and various others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId218576&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 9th Role of Revelation: Muhammad found a way to get rid of his old wife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Muhammad grew stronger and wealthier in Medina, he began marrying multiple young and beautiful women, despite his own age ranging between 58 and 63 years. The women he married were generally between the ages of 17 and 35, making Muhammad double, triple, or even four times their age. Islamic traditions highlight that these women, such as Juwayria, Safiyyah, Rehana, Zaynab, and Umm Habiba, were not only young but also exceptionally beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sawdah was the only wife of Muhammad who was older than the newlywed ladies, though still younger than Muhammad himself. In the presence of his young and attractive wives, Muhammad desired to part ways with Sawdah. Muhammad had married Sawdah in Mecca during a time of weakness and poverty when he faced opposition from the entire city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fulfill his wish of separating from Sawdah, Muhammad once again invoked revelation and claimed that Allah had sent the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/33.51&quot;&gt;33:51&lt;/a&gt;) You, [O Muhammad], may put aside whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, after the revelation of this verse, the only wife whom Muhammad chose to divorce, was the old lady Sawdah. It was despite the fact that Sawdah was serving Muhammad from the time of Mecca, when Muhammad was poor and weak, while other wives were new, and they hardly lived with Muhammad for a few years in Medina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daaiyatulislam.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/tafsir-ibn-kathir-surah-4-an-nisa.pdf&quot;&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Verse 4:128)&lt;/a&gt;, upon learning of Muhammad's intention to divorce her, Sawdah sought refuge in 'Aisha's house. When Muhammad arrived, Sawdah expressed her willingness to give up her turn to 'Aisha but pleaded with him not to divorce her. Muhammad readily agreed and promptly claimed the revelation of the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.128?context=3&quot;&gt;4:128-129&lt;/a&gt;) And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them (i.e. woman agrees upon leaving some of her rights) … &lt;strong&gt;And you will never be able to do Justice (Arabic: تَعْدِلُوْا) between wives&lt;/strong&gt;, even if you should strive [to do so].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, do you notice the contradiction? Previously, the author of the Quran (Muhammad) had established the condition of justice ('adl) for having multiple wives (Quran 4:3). However, in this particular verse (Quran 4:128-129), he permits a husband to manipulate his wives by threatening divorce, thus pressuring them into relinquishing their rights in the name of a settlement. This undermines the requirement of justice, as the husband retains control over the right to divorce, resulting in settlements that consistently favor him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.3&quot;&gt;Quran 4:3&lt;/a&gt;) If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, Two or three or four;&lt;strong&gt; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one&lt;/strong&gt;, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, the verse (Quran 4:128-129) has abrogated the verse of doing justice among multiple wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse, about usurping the rights of women by blackmailing them, is the base upon which the institution of Misyaar marriage is constructed. And women are openly abused in Misyaar marriage in Arab countries (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8EB1JHNaDIM&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId814888&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 10th Role of Revelation: Muhammad deprived his wives of the right to equal time and their turns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In verse 4:3, Muhammad initially established the condition that husbands must divide their time equally among their four wives, ensuring each wife had her designated turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he later invoked verse 33:51 to completely exempt himself from this condition, without seeking any consent from his wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the commentary of verse &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wordofallah.com/tafseer&quot;&gt;33:51&lt;/a&gt;, Ibn Kathir writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{ تُرْجِى مَن تَشَآءُ مِنْهُنَّ } الآية، أي من أزواجك، لا حرج عليك أن تترك القسم لهن، فتقدم من شئت، وتؤخر من شئت، وتجامع من شئت، وتترك من شئت، هكذا يروى عن ابن عباس ومجاهد والحسن وقتادة وأبي رزين وعبد الرحمن بن زيد بن أسلم وغيرهم&lt;br&gt;Allah’s saying in Quran (i.e. &lt;em&gt;You can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them&lt;/em&gt;,) means, 'your wives:&lt;strong&gt; there is no sin on you if you stop dividing your time equally between them, and delay the turn of one of them and bring forward the turn of another as you wish, and you have intercourse with one and not another as you wish&lt;/strong&gt;.' This was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Abu Razin, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, not only Sawdah but all of Muhammad's wives lost their entitlement to equal time and turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId513528&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 11th Role of Revelation: Making slave-woman Mariyah again lawful for himself (for sexual intercourse) through the Revelation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad had 9 wives and 21 slave women (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fislamweb.net%2Far%2Flibrary%2Findex.php%3Fpage%3Dbookcontents%26flag%3D1%26bk_no%3D59%26ID%3D588%26fbclid%3DIwAR32OPC0qxmnE67UL8QKzZUyio3UbtCuEuPJZPuAQycRwaiMiQzjf87eNhw&amp;amp;h=AT0VXXder0Xm9MvJwtNOXYDSpYnASNbTDGl-A1KrrlsoO016tRr4e2Jvkeo2KUV5C2mh8i_ZUAdbKvKKL46q1tdRUcN55bXSjlcpCUiOx-Ha9wAgdCzJ7e_IjJjKVAluWqia7yLZS6X58C3G0fT3&amp;amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;amp;c%5B0%5D=AT0jwI-yqfL27Fowu4QlA5V-_ULhwb4ksbCJPAhDGeK4Qu-UDL99Y4CBX71OwUSKjctmu8AcL7LVq9es_ReMnFqwlxHWFXao11LL3x2gEjP7BzRyVkgTq-xHA8R5V7k_mkXLrPTg4gVa-jf6axWWjHpe0V9sR0G1sbw&quot;&gt;Ibn Kathir&lt;/a&gt;). One of them was Maria. She was a beautiful lady, and 'Aisha was jealous of her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maulana Maudodi recorded in his Tafhim under the commentary of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tafheemulquran.net/1_Tafheem/0_Tafheem.html&quot;&gt;66:1&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hafidh Ibn Hajr recorded this saying of Hadirhat 'Aisha in his book al-Asaba: &quot;The arrival of any other wife of the prophet did not displease me as much as the arrival of Maria did, because she was beautiful and charming, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) was very fond of her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad followed a rotational schedule to visit each of his wives. On one such occasion, it was Hafsa's turn, but she had temporarily left to visit her father. Upon her return, Hafsa discovered Muhammad engaged in sexual relations with his slave woman, Maria, in her room. This incident deeply upset Hafsa, prompting Muhammad to swear an oath to refrain from further relations with Maria in order to regain Hafsa's happiness. However, Muhammad requested that Hafsa keep this matter confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Hafsa shared the incident with 'Aisha, and it is possible that 'Aisha later observed Muhammad breaking his promise by continuing a discreet relationship with Maria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959&quot;&gt;Sunan Nisai, Hadith 3959&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: &quot;O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: Sahih&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (authentic)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to that, Muhammad's anger surged, prompting him to assert the revelation of the following verses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/66.1?context=5&quot;&gt;66:1-4&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;O Prophet, why do you forbid what Allah has made lawful for you? Is it to please your wives? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. &lt;strong&gt;Allah has prescribed for you a way for the absolution of your oaths (i.e. the Prophet can make Mariyah permissible again for himself through this process)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;And Allah is your protector, and He is the Knowing, the Wise. And [remember] when the Prophet confided to one of his wives a statement; and when she informed [another] of it and Allah showed it to him, he made known part of it and ignored a part. And when he informed her about it, she said, &quot;Who told you this?&quot; He said, &quot;I was informed by the Knowing, the Acquainted.&quot; If you two [wives] repent to Allah, [it is best], for your hearts have deviated. &lt;strong&gt;But if you cooperate against him - then indeed Allah is his protector, and Gabriel and the righteous of the believers and the angels, moreover, are [his] assistants&lt;/strong&gt;. Perhaps his Lord,&lt;strong&gt; if he divorced you [all], would substitute for him wives better than you - submitting [to Allah], believing, devoutly obedient, repentant, worshipping, and traveling - [ones] previously married and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;virgins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Muhammad achieved the following goals through this revelation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He succeeded in making beautiful and young Mariyah again permissible for him. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He succeeded in threatening his wives so that they feared him and never dared to criticize and put any restrictions on his sexual activities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also taunted them that they were not VIRGINGS. Also, the threat was that Muhammad could divorce all of them and would get a lot more new wives who were better than them in every regard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId60769&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad also had four concubines with whom he engaged in sexual relations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn al-Qayyim recorded in his book Zaad al-Ma’aad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220509160304/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=21&amp;amp;idto=21&amp;amp;bk_no=127&amp;amp;ID=23&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قال أبو عبيدة : كان له أربع : مارية وهي أم ولده إبراهيم ، وريحانة وجارية أخرى جميلة أصابها في بعض السبي ، وجارية وهبتها له &lt;span class=&quot;names&quot;&gt;زينب بنت جحش &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu ‘Ubaydah said: He had four (concubines): Mariyah, who was the mother of his son Ibraaheem; Rayhaanah; another beautiful slave woman whom he acquired as a prisoner of war; and a slave woman who was given to him by Zaynab bint Jahsh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210211034055/https://answering-islam.org/Shamoun/mary_concubine.htm&quot;&gt;Please read more details here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Muhammad's living quarters were limited as he had a small house attached to the mosque. Due to the lack of space, there was no room for additional concubines. However, on one occasion, Muhammad engaged in sexual relations with Mariyah in Hafsa's room. Hafsa unexpectedly returned and discovered them together. This incident ignited her anger, leading her to inform Aisha as well. Consequently, both Hafsa and Aisha prevented Muhammad from being alone with Maria, prompting Muhammad to make a solemn oath not to have sexual relations with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959&quot;&gt;Sunan Nisai, Hadith 3959&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: &quot;O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade: Sahih&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (authentic)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId938882&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;16 Special Privileges, which Muhammad reserved for himself through Revelation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Qurtubi is a famous Quranic Scholar. He lists those 16 special privileges, which Muhammad reserved only for himself through revelation, including the right to take another man’s wife if he so desired:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First: To be fair with the spoils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second: To (forcefully) take a fifth of a fifth or just a fifth (of the spoils of war).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third: &quot;Al Wisal&quot; (Dimitrius- the fast or fasting. This usually refers to fasting or abstaining from food.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth: To take more than four women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifth: To marry, &quot;Yas-tan-kih&quot; (or have intercourse), with a woman who verbally pronounces her dedication (to the prophet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sixth: To marry, &quot;Yas-tan-kih,&quot; without the presence (or permission) of a legal guardian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seventh: To marry, &quot;Yas-tan-kih,&quot; without a dowry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eighth: To marry (and have intercourse) during a state of ritual consecration and purification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ninth: The annulment of an oath he may make to his wives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenth: If Muhammad looks at a woman (and desires her) THEN IT IS NECESSARY FOR HER HUSBAND TO DIVORCE HER AND FOR MUHAMMAD TO MARRY HER. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ibn Al A’raby said, &quot;This is what the servant of the two holy mosques has also said, as was clear to the scholars FROM THE STORY OF ZAID which also had this meaning.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eleventh: That the prophet released Safiyyah (from her captured status) and he considered her release as her dowry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twelfth: To enter Mecca without being in a state of ritual purification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirteenth: To fight in Mecca.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourteenth: That he is not inherited by anyone at all. This was mentioned in the oath of absolution for when a man approaches death due to illness, most of his possessions are taken away, so that he does not have more than a third left for him. But the possessions of the prophet remained for him, as is evidenced in the verse of inheritance and in Surat Mariam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifteenth: His marriage is still considered effective after his death (i.e. his widows were not allowed to marry any other man after him).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sixteenth: If he divorces a woman, she remains prohibited to everyone and may not be married, to someone else.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId255729&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Summary:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiating between the real incident of the Satanic Verses and the fictitious novel by Salman Rushdie is of utmost importance. The authentic incident sheds light on the fallibility within the claimed divine revelation, challenging the existence of a heavenly Allah and suggesting that Muhammad himself was responsible for the revelation, resulting in human errors within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other event exposes the human errors within the alleged divine revelation as clearly as the original incident of the Satanic Verses. Unfortunately, a vast majority of people, including Muslims, are unaware of this significant event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of awareness can be attributed to the confusion caused by Mr. Rushdie's fictional novel, also titled &quot;Satanic Verses,&quot; which bears little resemblance to the actual incident. Regrettably, this misunderstanding has prevented the true incident of the Satanic Verses from reaching the masses. Presently, people struggle to distinguish between reality and fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists have capitalized on this situation, exploiting it to incite hatred among Muslim youth against the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Rushdie cannot be held responsible for this situation, as he is an intelligent writer who observed contradictions within the purported divine revelation, he was neither an Islamic scholar nor equipped to withstand the ensuing life-threatening attacks. The responsibility to make the world aware of the original incident primarily lies with scholars of Islamic studies and perhaps ex-Muslims as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of Islamic Studies, significant scholarly research on the incident of the Satanic Verses emerged in 2017 with the publication of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nes.princeton.edu/publications/contributor/ahmed-shahab&quot;&gt;Mr. Shahab Ahmed's&lt;/a&gt; book titled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Before-Orthodoxy-Satanic-Verses-Early-ebook/dp/B0747JQKKV/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QL2JE8QNYVFN&amp;amp;keywords=Before+Orthodoxy%3A+The+Satanic+Verses+in+Early+Islam&amp;amp;qid=1660673380&amp;amp;sprefix=before+orthodoxy+the+satanic+verses+in+early+islam%2Caps%2C437&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Before Orthodoxy: The Satanic Verses in Early Islam.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; This groundbreaking work encompasses a collection of 50 traditions related to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Shahab Ahmed, a brilliant individual, authored an extraordinary book. However, it remains incomplete as he intended to write the second and third volumes before his untimely death in 2015 at the age of 48 due to leukemia. His passing was a profound loss. Nevertheless, we are fortunate that the first volume of his remarkable work was published in 2017 even after his demise.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId451818&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Background and Summary of 50 Traditions on the Incident of Satanic Verses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ancient Mecca, the pagan society was characterized by illiteracy and superstition. They worshipped multiple gods and were open to the introduction of new deities, as evidenced by the presence of 360 idols in the Ka'ba, each representing different tribes. However, they fiercely opposed anyone who questioned the authenticity of their gods, particularly because their economy was intertwined with the worship of these deities. The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca brought wealth and prosperity to the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Muhammad established his new religion, he made the mistake of challenging the pagan gods, asserting that they were false. This threatened the Meccans' religious and economic interests, as they feared losing the significance of their gods. Prior to Muhammad, both Jews and Christians had made similar attempts to disprove pagan gods, but they had failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the people of Mecca vehemently reacted against Muhammad and his followers. The situation became so hostile that many of his followers were forced to flee Mecca and seek refuge in Abyssinia to save their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing his error, Muhammad devised a new plan to reconcile with the Meccans. He aimed to convince them to accept Allah as a new god and himself as a prophet by praising their pagan gods. As part of this plan, Muhammad began expressing his &quot;desire&quot; for Allah to acknowledge the high status of the Meccan gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a gathering of the Quraysh, Muhammad claimed that Allah had started revealing messages to him through the angel Gabriel. It was on this occasion that he recited Surah an-Najm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Surah an-Najm, Muhammad also acknowledged the pagan goddesses and praised their elevated status and ability to intercede. This praise consisted of a total of four verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَاللاتِ وَالْعُزَّى وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةِ الأُخْرَى، فَإِنَّهُنَّ الْغَرَانِيقُ الْعُلَى وَإِنَّ شفاعتهن لَتُرْتَجَى&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 1: Have you pondered upon al-Lat and al-Uzza, the goddesses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 2: And Manat, the third goddess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 3: These (3 goddesses) are like high flying cranes (i.e. they are of high status);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 4: Verily their intercession is accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon completing Surah an-Najm, Muhammad prostrated himself, and the Quraysh also followed suit, accepting the elevated status of their goddesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan goddesses were given a resemblance to high-flying cranes while 'high flying', metaphorically meant flying high close to the heavens where Allah is physically present - to act as intercessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad's plan ultimately failed, as people observed clear contradictions in the divine revelation. Previous revelations had consistently denounced pagan gods as false deities, while this new revelation affirmed their authenticity, high status, and ability to intercede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the Meccan pagans easily concluded that Allah did not exist in the heavens and that Muhammad himself was fabricating these revelations. They ridiculed Muhammad even more after this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with the failure of his plan, Muhammad resorted to a new narrative. He claimed that Allah had not revealed anything about the elevated status of the pagan gods, but rather, it was his own mistake. He asserted that Satan had led him astray, resulting in the utterance of the two Satanic Verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this newly made story, Muhammad told Quraysh that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad received a visit from Gabriel in the evening, who requested him to repeat the verses previously revealed to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, Muhammad recited before Gabriel the verses that praised the gods worshipped by the Quraysh, unaware that these were the Satanic verses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon hearing this, Gabriel informed Muhammad that those verses were not the ones originally conveyed by Allah, but were in fact the Satanic verses that Satan had caused him to recite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following this revelation, Muhammad proclaimed that Allah had sent two additional verses as divine revelation, which are as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Surah Hajj 22:52-53&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وَمَا أَرْ‌سَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّ‌سُولٍ وَلَا نَبِيٍّ إِلَّا إِذَا &lt;strong&gt;تَمَنَّىٰ&lt;/strong&gt; أَلْقَى الشَّيْطَانُ فِي &lt;strong&gt;أُمْنِيَّتِهِ فَيَنسَخُ &lt;/strong&gt;اللَّـهُ مَا يُلْقِي الشَّيْطَانُ ثُمَّ يُحْكِمُ اللَّـهُ آيَاتِهِ ۗ وَاللَّـهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ۔ لِيَجْعَلَ مَا يُلْقِي الشَّيْطَانُ فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ وَالْقَاسِيَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ لَفِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ&lt;/p&gt;
And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;strong&gt;desires' (Arabic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; تمنی)&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his &lt;strong&gt;desire (Arabic: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:15%29&quot;&gt;um'niyyatihi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; أُمْنِيَّتِهِ)&lt;/strong&gt;, so God &lt;strong&gt;'abrogates' &lt;/strong&gt;what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His verses precise again (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). And Allah is Knowing and Wise. He (Allah) makes, what is thrown in by Shaitan (Satan), a &lt;strong&gt;Test &lt;/strong&gt;for those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy and disbelief) and whose hearts are hardened. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two new verses of Surah al-Hajj served multiple purposes, which can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: One objection raised by the pagans was why Muhammad, being the chosen prophet of Allah, could be misled by Satan. To address this objection, Muhammad clarified through these verses that his momentary misguidance did not undermine the divine nature of his religion. He explained that all previous prophets had also experienced similar temptations from Satan due to their human desires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Muhammad needed to eliminate the presence of the Satanic Verses, which praised the pagan goddesses, from the Quran. To achieve this objective, the new verses revealed that Allah had abrogated and rectified what the devil had inserted. This emphasized that Allah's true verses were made precise again, nullifying any influence from Satan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Third Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: The pagans questioned why Allah had allowed Satan to misguide Muhammad and why any mistakes in the verses were not corrected immediately. In response, Muhammad offered an explanation that Allah had permitted Satan's interference as a &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; for those whose hearts harbored diseases or weaknesses. This excuse presented it as an opportunity for individuals to demonstrate their steadfastness and faithfulness. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9729%; height: 168px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 80%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 168px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: rgb(254, 253, 234); text-align: left; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid rgb(224, 62, 45); height: 168px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: It is worth noting that Muhammad utilized this tactic of declaring &quot;mistakes&quot; of Allah as &quot;TEST&quot; from Allah on various occasions throughout his life. For example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mod-articles-category-title &quot; href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/quran-2/322-abrogation-of-bayt-al-muqaddas-as-qibla-due-to-jewish-enmity&quot;&gt;Abrogation of Bayt al-Maqdis as Qibla due to Jewish Enmity&lt;/a&gt; [Excuse: It was a TEST]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mod-articles-category-title &quot; href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/52-why-did-allah-wrongly-accepted-that-uthman-was-killed-in-hudaybiyyah&quot;&gt;Why did Allah WRONGLY assume that Uthman was killed in Hudaybiyyah?&lt;/a&gt; [Excuse: It was a Test]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, after all these modifications and deletion of verses in the name of “abrogation” (نسخ) and deletion, today Surah an-Najm is present in this form in the Quran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9729%; height: 522.667px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 7.07131%;&quot;&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 53.7257%;&quot;&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 39.1767%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;height: 34.6667px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;These are the beautiful goddesses like high flying cranes;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 34.6667px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 34.6667px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Verily their intercession is accepted&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;height: 24px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 24px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Are you to have the males, and He (Allah) the females?&lt;/td&gt;

Their aim was to refute Satanic Verses (i.e. to deny that Pagan goddesses have any high Ranks with Allah). &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 24px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 24px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 24px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;What a bizarre distribution. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 72px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 72px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 72px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;These are nothing but names, which you have devised, you and your ancestors, for which God sent down no authority. They follow nothing but assumptions, and what the ego desires, even though guidance has come to them from their Lord.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 96px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 96px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 96px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Or shall man have whatever he '&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;' (Arabic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تمنی&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 96px; background-color: rgb(254, 253, 234); border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Muhammad introduced an additional verse to Surah an-Najm, aiming to provide him with protection regarding his previous '&lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt;' where he expressed a wish for Allah to reveal something favorable about the pagan gods.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 47.875px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 47.875px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 47.875px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;To God belong the Last and the First.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 141.333px; background-color: rgb(194, 224, 244); border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Muhammad included more new verses in Surah an-Najm to negate the '&lt;strong&gt;INTERCESSION&lt;/strong&gt;' of the exalted pagan goddesses he had acknowledged in the Satanic Verses. These new verses suggested that although angels also reside/fly high in the heavens near Allah (similar to the high-flying pagan goddesses), their &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; is not granted unless permitted by Allah.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 93.4583px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 93.4583px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 93.4583px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;How many an angel is there in the heavens whose &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId74363&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The words DESIRE and INTERCESSION in these verses make it impossible to deny the incident of Satanic Verses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that Islamic apologists today deny that verses 19 to 26 of Surah an-Najm have anything to do with the incident of Satanic Verses, as they deny the occurrence of this incident altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the presence of the words DESIRE and INTERCESSION in these verses is very important, as it makes it impossible for them to deny the occurrence of this incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Verse 24):  Or shall man have whatever he &lt;strong&gt;'desires' (Arabic:&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt; tamannā&lt;/a&gt; تمنی) &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;(Verse 25): To God belong the Last and the First.&lt;br&gt;(Verse 26): How many an angel is there in the heavens whose &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of verse 24 in Surah an-Najm  ( &lt;strong&gt;أَمْ لِلْإِنسَانِ مَا &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تَمَنَّىٰ&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Or shall man have whatever he '&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'?&lt;/strong&gt;), provides evidence supporting the authenticity of the incident known as the Satanic Verses as mentioned in the 50 Traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to note that verse 24, which focuses on fulfilling human &lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;, is totally unrelated (out of context) to the preceding verses that discuss the denial of the high status of pagan gods. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Similarly, this &quot;desire&quot; also has nothing to do with the &lt;strong&gt;proceeding&lt;/strong&gt; verses (which talk about the intercession of angels). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this context, the inclusion of verse 24 at this particular point appears illogical and lacks coherence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we accept the incident of Satanic Verses indeed happened (as mentioned in those 50 Traditions), then verse 24 of Surah an-Najm immediately starts making &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sense&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;logic&lt;/strong&gt; at this place. It proves that the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) later included this verse 24 (about getting what man desires) here, in order to counter the incident of Satanic Verses, in which he had previously told Meccans about his '&lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;' for reconciliation with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the word '&lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt;' in verse 26 of Surah an-Najm also proves that indeed this verse was also linked to the incident of Satanic Verses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Surah an-Najm, Verse 26)&lt;/strong&gt; How many angels are there in the heavens whose &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, it is evident that the inclusion of the verse regarding the 'intercession of angels' lacks any relevance to the surrounding verses. It is out of place and fails to contribute any logical or meaningful connection to the context of the preceding or subsequent verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we accept that the incident of Satanic Verses indeed happened (as mentioned in those 50 Traditions), then verse 26 immediately starts making perfect sense and perfect logic at this place, while the two abrogated/deleted Satanic Verses were talking about the &quot;intercession&quot; of pagan goddesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It proves that the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) revealed this new verse about the intercession of angels here in order to refute the Satanic Verses, which affirmed the intercession of pagan goddesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional two verses about the same incident of Satanic Verses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two additional verses are as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first verse is from Surah al-Hajj:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Surah Hajj 22:52&lt;/a&gt;) And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his &lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;, so God &lt;strong&gt;'abrogates' &lt;/strong&gt;what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His &lt;strong&gt;verses precise again&lt;/strong&gt; (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). And Allah is Knowing and Wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second verse is from Surah Bani Israel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt; 17:73-75&lt;/a&gt;) And indeed,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;they were about to&lt;strong&gt; tempt you away from that which We revealed&lt;/strong&gt; to you in order to [make] you &lt;strong&gt;INVENT about Us something else (i.e. the Satanic Verses)&lt;/strong&gt;; and then they would have taken you &lt;strong&gt;as a friend&lt;/strong&gt;. And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little &lt;strong&gt;(i.e. Muhammad's DESIRE to reconciliate with them)&lt;/strong&gt;. Then [if you had], We would have made you taste &lt;strong&gt;double [punishment in] life and double [after] death&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the verses mentioned above were revealed in response to the incident of the Satanic Verses. However, later Muslims dispersed these verses throughout different chapters of the Quran, intentionally preventing readers from finding them in one place to avoid raising questions about the incident of Satanic Verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId752021&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why do Islamic apologists try to deny the connection between verse 22:52 of Surah al-Hajj and the incident of the Satanic Verses?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists deny any &lt;strong&gt;link&lt;/strong&gt; between these verses of Surah an-Najm and Surah al-Hajj as they deny the whole incident of Satanic Verses and those 50 Traditions about them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Surah al-Hajj is a witness that indeed abrogation &amp;amp; deletion (in the name of cleaning filth) of Quranic verses took place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Surah Hajj 22:52&lt;/a&gt;) And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his &lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;, so God &lt;strong&gt;'abrogates' &lt;/strong&gt;what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His &lt;strong&gt;verses precise again&lt;/strong&gt; (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). And Allah is Knowing and Wise. He (Allah) makes, what is thrown in by Shaitan (Satan), a &lt;strong&gt;Test&lt;/strong&gt; for those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy and disbelief) and whose hearts are hardened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, which were the verses which were abrogated and then deleted in the name of making the Quran precise again? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 50 traditions are unanimous that it was Surah an-Najm, in which Satanic Verses were abrogated and then deleted for making the Quran precise again. Thus, these verses of Surah al-Hajj and Surah an-Najm are directly linked to each other and are about the same incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Islamic apologists today deny any link between these verses of Surah al-Hajj and Surah an-Najm, then they have to tell us: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which were those verses that were abrogated and then deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And why were they abrogated and why were they deleted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the occurrence of the word &quot;DESIRE&quot; ('&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; تمنی&lt;/strong&gt;') in both verses of Surah an-Najm and Surah al-Hajj also proves they are LINKED with each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Suran an-Najm, Verse 24)&lt;/strong&gt; Or shall man have whatever he '&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;' (Arabic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تمنی&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Surah Hajj 22:52&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;' &lt;strong&gt;(Arabic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تمنی&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his desire (Arabic: &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:15%29&quot;&gt;um'niyyatihi&lt;/a&gt; أُمْنِيَّتِهِ), so God 'abrogates' what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His verses precise again (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, these Quranic Verses themselves prove that those 50 traditions are correct about the incident of Satanic Verses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why are Islamic apologists compelled to deny the connection between verses &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt;17:73-75&lt;/a&gt; of Surah Bani Israel and the incident of the Satanic Verses? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Islamic apologists are compelled to deny any link between verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt;17:73-75&lt;/a&gt; of Surah Bani Israel and the incident of Satanic Verses. It is due to TWO mistakes that Muhammad made while composing this verse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt; 17:73-75&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;they were about to&lt;strong&gt; tempt you away from that which We revealed&lt;/strong&gt; to you in order to [make] you &lt;strong&gt;INVENT about Us something else (i.e. the Satanic Verses)&lt;/strong&gt;; and then they would have taken you &lt;strong&gt;as a friend&lt;/strong&gt;. And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little &lt;strong&gt;(i.e. Muhammad's DESIRE to reconciliate with them)&lt;/strong&gt;. Then [if you had], We would have made you taste &lt;strong&gt;double [punishment in] life and double [after] death&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad sought to deflect the blame for the Satanic Verses away from Allah and onto himself. It was crucial to absolve Allah of any responsibility, emphasizing that Satan has no power over Allah and that He is infallible. Failure to do so could have jeopardized the foundation of the entire new religion of Muhammad. To strengthen his position, Muhammad revealed the subsequent verse, creating the impression that Allah was displeased with him for this mistake and even threatened him with double punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Syuti recorded the following tradition in his Tafsir under the verse 17:73 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=17&amp;amp;tAyahNo=73&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وأخرج ابن أبي حاتم عن محمد بن كعب القرظي رضي الله عنه قال: أنزل الله{ والنجم إذا هوى } [النجم: 1] فقرأ عليهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم هذه الآية{ أفرأيتم اللات والعزى } [النجم: 19] فألقى عليه الشيطان كلمتين: لك الغرانيق العلى، وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى. فقرأ النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ما بقي من السورة وسجد، فأنزل الله { وإن كادوا ليفتنونك عن الذي أوحينا إليك... } الآية. فما زال مغموماً مهموماً حتى أنزل الله تعالى{ وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي... } [الحج: 52] الآية.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurazi (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Allah revealed {By the star when it descends} [An-Najm: 1], and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) recited this verse to them: {Have you considered al-Lat and al-'Uzza?} [An-Najm: 19]. Satan then cast two phrases upon him: &quot;These are the exalted cranes (idols), and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for.&quot; The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) recited the remainder of the surah and prostrated. Then Allah revealed {And indeed, they were about to tempt you away from that which We revealed to you...} [Al-Isra: 73]. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) remained in a state of grief and distress until Allah revealed {And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet...} [Al-Hajj: 52].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Islamic apologists deny it, as they cannot let this verse to be linked to the incident of Satanic Verses while Muhammad made two fatal mistakes in this verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Mistake: This verse claims that Muhammad could get double punishment for his &quot;Unintentional&quot; Mistake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an important question arises: punishment is typically reserved for intentional mistakes. According to the Quran, Muhammad did not recite the Satanic Verses deliberately; he genuinely believed that Allah had fulfilled his desire, and Gabriel had brought those verses from Allah. If Allah had allowed Satan to misguide the prophet, why should the prophet be subjected to double punishment for an unintentional error?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Mistake: This verse claims it was not the Devil who misguided Muhammad for adding Satanic Verses, but it were Meccans who misguided Muhammad in doing it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the verse again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt; 17:73-75&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;they&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. Pagan Meccans) were about to&lt;strong&gt; tempt you away from that which We revealed&lt;/strong&gt; to you in order to [make] you &lt;strong&gt;INVENT about Us something else (i.e. the Satanic Verses)&lt;/strong&gt;; and then &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would have taken you &lt;strong&gt;as a friend&lt;/strong&gt;. And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a little &lt;strong&gt;(i.e. Muhammad's DESIRE to reconciliate with them)&lt;/strong&gt;. Then [if you had], We would have made you taste &lt;strong&gt;double [punishment in] life and double [after] death&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad was only human and naturally prone to making such errors while composing the verses himself. He forgot that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He had already blamed the Devil for his misguidance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And he had already claimed that he didn't &lt;strong&gt;INVENT&lt;/strong&gt; anything &lt;strong&gt;intentionally&lt;/strong&gt;, but it was the devil who inserted those 2 verses. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next step, Islamic apologists fabricated seven different traditions to disconnect this verse from the incident of the Satanic Verses. However, as with all lies, contradictions emerged in all these 7 traditions, with each claiming a separate incident for the revelation of the same verse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read these seven traditions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www-altafsir-com.translate.goog/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=17&amp;amp;tAyahNo=73&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&amp;amp;_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically, this verse was revealed in connection with only one incident. Moreover, the verse itself, with its references to temptation and inventing something new about Allah, fits the context of the Satanic Verses incident perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamists should be condemn for fabrication of thousands of such traditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId29472&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Incident of Satanic Verses in Traditions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Jarir al-Tabari recorded the following tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/3475_%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A2/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_75#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حدثنا ابن حميد قال حدثنا سلمة قال حدثني محمد بن إسحاق عن يزيد بن زياد المدني عن محمد بن كعب القرظي قال لما رأى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم تولى قومه عنه وشق عليه ما يرى من مباعدتهم ما جاءهم به من الله &lt;strong&gt;تمنى &lt;/strong&gt;في نفسه أن يأتيه من الله ما يقارب بينه وبين قومه وكان يسره مع حبه قومه وحرصه عليهم أن يلين له بعض ما قد غلظ عليه من أمرهم حتى حدث بذلك نفسه وتمناه وأحبه فأنزل الله عز وجل (والنجم إذا هوى ما ضل صاحبكم وما غوى وما ينطق عن الهوى - فلما انتهى إلى قوله - أفرأيتم اللات والعزى ومناة الثالثة الأخرى) ألقى الشيطان على لسانه لما كان يحدث به نفسه ويتمنى أن يأتي به قومه تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن ترتضي فلما سمعت قريش فرحوا وسرهم وأعجبهم ما ذكر به آلهتهم فأصاخوا له والمؤمنون مصدقون نبيهم فيما جاءهم به عن ربهم ولا يتهمونه على خطأ ولا وهم ولا زلل فلما انتهى إلى السجدة منها وختم السورة سجد فيها فسجد المسلمون بسجود نبيهم تصديقا لما جاء به واتباعا لامره وسجد من في المسجد من المشركين من قريش وغيرهم لما سمعوا من ذكر آلهتهم فلم يبق في المسجد مؤمن ولا كافر إلا سجد إلا الوليد بن المغيرة فإنه كان شيخا كبيرا فلم يستطع السجود فاخذ بيده حفنة من البطحاء فسجد عليها ثم تفرق الناس من المسجد وخرجت قريش وقد سرهم ما سمعوا من ذكر آلهتهم يقولون قد ذكر محمد آلهتنا بأحسن الذكر قد زعم فيما يتلو إنها الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن ترتضي وبلغت السجدة من بأرض الحبشة من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وقيل أسلمت قريش فنهض منهم رجال وتخلف آخرون وآتى جبريل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال يا محمد ماذا صنعت لقد تلوت على الناس ما لم آتك به عن الله عز وجل وقلت ما لم يقل لك فحزن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم عند ذلك حزنا شديدا وخاف من الله خوفا كثيرا فأنزل الله عز وجل وكان به رحيما يعزيه ويخفض عليه الامر ويخبره أنه لم يك قبله نبي ولا رسول تمنى كما تمنى ولا أحب كما أحب الا والشيطان قد ألقى في أمنيته كما ألقى على لسانه صلى الله عليه وسلم فنسخ الله ما ألقى الشيطان وأحكم آبائه أي فإنما أنت كبعض الأنبياء والرسل فأنزل الله عز وجل (وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي إلا إذا تمنى ألقى الشيطان في أمنيته فينسخ الله ما يلقى الشيطان ثم يحكم الله آياته والله عليم حكيم) فاذهب الله عز وجل عن نبيه الحزن وآمنه من الذي كان يخاف ونسخ ما ألقى الشيطان على لسانه من ذكر آلهتهم إنها الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن ترتضي بقول الله عز وجل ذكر اللات والعزى ومناة الثلاثة الأخرى (ألكم الذكر وله الأنثى تلك إذا قسمة ضيزى) أي عوجاء (إن هي إلا أسماء سميتموها أنتم وآباؤكم - إلى قوله - لمن يشاء ويرضى) أي فكيف تنفع شفاعة آلهتكم عنده فلما جاء من الله ما نسخ ما كان الشيطان ألقى على لسان نبيه قالت قريش ندم محمد على ما ذكر من منزلة آلهتكم عند الله فغير ذلك وجاء بغيره وكان ذانك الحرفان اللذان ألقى الشيطان على لسان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قد وقعا في فم كل مشرك فازدادوا شرا إلى ما كانوا عليه وشدة على من أسلم &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the messenger of God saw how his tribe turned their backs on him and was grieved to see them shunning the message he had brought to them from God, he &lt;strong&gt;desired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from his soul&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that something would come to him from God which would reconcile him with his tribe. With his love for his tribe and his eagerness for their welfare it would have delighted him if some of the difficulties which they made for him could have been smoothed out, and he debated with himself and fervently desired such an outcome. Then God revealed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Surah an-Najm, verses 1 to 3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;'By the Star when it sets, your comrade does not err, nor is he deceived; nor does he speak out of (his own) desire...'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; and when he came to the words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Surah an-Najm, verses 19 and 20)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Have you thought of al-Lat and al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then Satan cast on his tongue, because of his inner debates and what he &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to bring to his people, the words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Satanic Verse 1) 'These are the high-flying cranes;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Satanic Verse 2) verily their intercession is accepted with approval.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Quraysh heard this, they rejoiced and were happy and delighted at the way in which he spoke of their gods, and they listened to him, while the Muslims, having complete trust in their prophet in respect of the messages which he brought from God, did not suspect him of error, illusion, or mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he came to the prostration, having completed the surah an-Najm, he prostrated himself and the Muslims did likewise, following their prophet, trusting in the message which he had brought and following his example. Those polytheists of the Quraysh and others who were in the mosque likewise prostrated themselves because of the reference to their gods which they had heard, so that there was no one in the mosque, believer or unbeliever, who did not prostrate himself ... The Quraysh left delighted by the mention of their gods which they had heard, saying,'Muhammad has mentioned our gods in the most favorable way possible, stating in his recitation that they are the high-flying cranes and that their intercession is received with approval.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...  Then (later) Gabriel came to the Messenger of God and said, 'Muhammad, what have you done? You have recited to the people that which I did not bring to you from God, and you have said that which was not said to you.' Then the messenger of God was much grieved and feared God greatly, but God sent down a revelation to him, for He was merciful to him, consoling him and making the matter light for him, informing him that there had never been a prophet or a messenger before him who &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as he desired and wished as he wished but that Satan had cast words into his recitation, as he had cast words on Muhammad's tongue. Then God canceled what Satan had thus cast, and established his verses by telling him that he was like other prophets and messengers, and revealed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Surah al-Hajj, verses 52 and 53)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desires' (Arabic: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;tamannā&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; تمنی)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desire (Arabic: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:15%29&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;um'niyyatihi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; أُمْنِيَّتِهِ)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, so God &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;'abrogates' &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;what the devil throws in، &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;then Allah makes His verses precise again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, God removed the sorrow from his messenger, reassured him about that which he had feared and canceled the words which Satan had cast on his tongue, that their gods were the high-flying cranes whose intercession was accepted with approval. He now revealed, following the mention of 'al-Lat, al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other,' the words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Surah an-Najm, verses 21 to 26)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; 'Are yours the males and his the females? That indeed was an unfair division! They are but names which you have named, you and your fathers ...to whom he wills and accepts ' &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, how can the intercession of their gods avail with God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Muhammad brought a revelation from God canceling what Satan had cast on the tongue of His prophet, the Quraysh said,'Muhammad has repented of what he said concerning the position of your gods with God, and has altered it and brought something else.' Those two phrases which Satan had cast on the tongue of the Messenger of God were in the mouth of every polytheist, and they became even more ill-disposed and more violent in their persecution of those of them who had accepted Islam and followed the messenger of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Suyuti recorded this incident from an &quot;authentic&quot; chain of narration (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220810224353/http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=22&amp;amp;tAyahNo=52&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وأخرج ابن جرير وابن المنذر وابن أبي حاتم وابن مردويه بسند صحيح، عن سعيد بن جبير قال: قرأ رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بمكة النجم، فلما بلغ هذا الموضع { أفرأيتم اللات والعزى ومناة الثالثة الأخرى } ألقى الشيطان على لسانه تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى. قالوا: ما ذكر آلهتنا بخير قبل اليوم، فسجد وسجدوا، ثم جاءه جبريل بعد ذلك قال: اعرض عليَّ ما جئتك به. فلما بلغ: تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى. قال له جبريل: لم آتك بهذا؛ هذا من الشيطان فأنزل الله { وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي }.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Jarir and others recorded through 'Sahih' (authentic) chain of narration from Saeed Ibn Jubayr that the prophet started reciting Surah Najam in Mecca. When he came to verse (&lt;em&gt;Have you thought upon al-Lat and al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other?&lt;/em&gt;), then the devil threw (&lt;em&gt;alqa&lt;/em&gt;) upon his tongue: “Those are the elevated cranes: truly their intercession is dearly hoped!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon that the pagans said to Muhammad that he never before praised their idols. The Prophet prostrated and the pagans too prostrated along with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, Jibrael came and asked Muhammad to recite that which he earlier brought to him. When Muhammad recited the satanic verse, then Jibrael told him that he didn't bring that verse to him, but it was from the Satan. Thus, Allah revealed at that time: (Quran 22:52: And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he &quot;&lt;strong&gt;desires'' (Arabic: Tammana تمنی)&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw in his desire, so God erases what the devil throws in ...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident occurred five years after Muhammad had received prophethood. It raises the question of why Muhammad, after five years, did not possess knowledge about whether the pagan gods were false or true deities of high status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Meccans (Quraysh) noticed this apparent &quot;contradiction&quot; in the revelations and began mocking Muhammad for it. It seems perplexing that Muhammad himself did not recognize the contradiction and immediately refute the so-called Satanic Verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, during the revelation of the verses, how was Satan able to influence Muhammad in the presence of Gabriel? Why didn't Gabriel intervene to prevent Satan's influence? According to Islam, only humans cannot see Satan, but angels are not oblivious to the devil's presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we assume that Gabriel was unable to see Satan, he could still hear what Muhammad was reciting to the gathering of pagans. Why didn't Gabriel warn Muhammad on the spot and prevent him from making such a grave mistake? Gabriel should have alerted Muhammad and rectified the situation before allowing him to leave the gathering of the Quraysh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's even more perplexing is that when Gabriel later visited Muhammad, Gabriel seemed unaware that Satan had misled Muhammad in reciting the Satanic Verses or of what transpired during that gathering. Gabriel only became aware of the incident after instructing Muhammad to revise the verses that he brought to him earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the entire incident, Allah did not intervene and allowed Muhammad to praise the pagan gods. However, in the evening, Allah suddenly became active and immediately revealed the verses of Surah Hajj, comforting Muhammad by stating that all previous prophets had also been misguided by Satan due to their desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why would Allah allow Satan to misguide His messengers? Allah offers the excuse that it was a &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot; However, the question arises: a test for whom? If Muhammad himself was led astray, failed the test, and started believing that the pagan gods held high status, then how could anyone else have a chance to pass this so-called &quot;test&quot;? Therefore, all those present, including Muhammad, prostrated to the pagan gods, and even the Muslims failed to recognize and denounce the Satanic Verses. They all failed the test unanimously. Hence, even if we assume the existence of Allah, the question arises about the &quot;wisdom&quot; of Allah. Why would He conduct a test with a guaranteed 0% success rate when His own prophet fell victim to Satan's influence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Subsequently, Allah busied Himself with removing the contamination of the Satanic Verses from the Quran. And after deleting the Satanic Verses from the Quran, Allah boasts about himself that people should look at His power and that He has the ability to clean the filth. So, people should believe in Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recurring use of the excuse of a &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; in the Quran is peculiar. Whenever the writer of the Quran faced unanswered questions, he resorted to this same excuse. For instance, when the Jews rejected Muhammad as a prophet of God, he became angry, and the writer of the Quran ordered a change in the Qibla direction (from Jerusalem to Mecca). When objections arose, the writer of the Quran once again invoked the excuse of a &quot;test&quot; to determine who would stand firm with Muhammad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&amp;amp;verse=143&quot;&gt;Quran 2:143&lt;/a&gt;). Even more perplexing is that not a single person, whether Muslim or hypocrite, abandoned Muhammad due to the change in Qibla. In this case, the success rate was 100%, with everyone passing the test, including the hypocrites. So, what was the purpose of such a test if everyone, including the hypocrites, would pass it? The reality is that this &quot;test&quot; is a feeble excuse, and the real reason for the change in Qibla was animosity towards the Jews. Please read all details here about this TEST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId970080&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamic Aqeedah (Belief): Even a 'donkey' is able to see Satan, but Prophet and Gabriel could not&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam asserts that even a humble creature like a donkey possesses the ability to perceive Satan's presence and alert others to it. However, it appears contradictory that Prophet Muhammad and Gabriel, who hold significant spiritual stature, were unable to see Satan. Consequently, Satan exerted dominance over both Muhammad and Gabriel, influencing the revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Beginning of Creation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/111&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet said, 'When you hear the crowing of cocks, ask for Allah's Blessings for (their crowing indicates that) they have seen an angel. And when you hear the braying of donkeys, seek Refuge with Allah from Satan for (their braying indicates) that they have seen a Satan.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another instance, the Prophet Muhammad expresses his strength by recounting an encounter in which he not only perceived Satan but also metaphorically symbolizes overpowering him, almost strangling him to the point of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Beginning of Creation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/21/14&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, 'Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Muhammad has a such high status that even a dream of a normal person becomes immune to Satan while the prophet Muhammad is present in his dream, but on the other hand, Muhammad was himself not immune to misguidance from Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Interpretations of Dreams (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/91/13&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet said, 'Whoever has seen me in a dream, then no doubt, he has seen me, for Satan cannot imitate my shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Muhammad holds such a high status that even the dreams of ordinary individuals become protected from Satan's influence when the Prophet Muhammad is present in those dreams. However, on the other hand, Muhammad himself was not immune to the potential misguidance from Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, book of creation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/96&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Sham (and asked. 'Who is here?'), The people said, 'Abu Ad-Darda.' Abu Darda said, 'Is the person whom Allah has protected against Satan, (as Allah's Messenger said) amongst you'. The sub narrator, Mughira said that the person who was given Allah's Refuge through the tongue of the Prophet was `Ammar (bin Yasir).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the 'contradictions' in the so-called divine revelations, which will ultimately lead to only one conclusion that it was Muhammad who was himself making those revelations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId242706&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;50 Traditions in Islamic sources regarding the Incident of Satanic Verses:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, the late Mr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahab_Ahmed&quot; hreflang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Shahab Ahmed&lt;/a&gt; wrote an amazing book '&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Before-Orthodoxy-Satanic-Verses-Early-ebook/dp/B0747JQKKV/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QL2JE8QNYVFN&amp;amp;keywords=Before+Orthodoxy%3A+The+Satanic+Verses+in+Early+Islam&amp;amp;qid=1660673380&amp;amp;sprefix=before+orthodoxy+the+satanic+verses+in+early+islam%2Caps%2C437&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before Orthodoxy: The Satanic Verses in Early Islam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;', in which he collected 50 traditions from many Sahaba (i.e. the 1st generation of Muslims) and tābi‘īn اَلتَّابِعِينَ (i.e. 2nd generation of Muslims) about the incident of Satanic Verses. You can buy this book if you want to read all these 50 traditions in English.

&lt;p&gt;Muslims underwent three stages regarding the incident of the Satanic Verses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Period&lt;/strong&gt;: During the initial 200 years, all Muslims universally accepted the incident of the Satanic Verses based on the teachings of the Quran and Traditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Period&lt;/strong&gt;: Following that, there was a period where some Muslims accepted the incident while others rejected it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Period&lt;/strong&gt;: In the last 200 years, the majority of Muslims almost universally deny that the incident of the Satanic Verses ever occurred, also based on the teachings of the same Quran and Traditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did the perception of the Satanic Verses incident shift from being considered 100% true to being viewed as 100% false? What caused this transformation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem arose when the &quot;contradictions&quot; in the &quot;divine revelation&quot; were exposed during the incident of the Satanic Verses. Despite presenting various excuses, Muslims were unable to conceal the human errors in those instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another contributing factor was the emergence of the doctrine within the Muslim community that &quot;Prophets are protected from being misguided by Satan.&quot; Mr. Shahab Ahmed clearly expressed this doctrine in the following words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the doctrines that emerged from the mid-2nd/8th century onwards was that of `ismat al-anbiya', literally the protection of the Prophets', meaning God's Protection of them from sin and error. The idea of the `ismah of the Prophets, which seems to have originated among the Shiah, was embraced as a doctrinal principle in some form or another by almost every Muslim sect and theological or legal school. With the spread of the concept that Muhammad constituted the model personality whose normative conduct (sunnah), as recorded in the klactith, was to be imitated by every Muslim, the idea that he should not sin must have appeared both logical and persuasive. Also, with the establishment of the legal principle that the Muslim community itself was protected from agreement upon error in the interpretation of Di-vine Law, it was hardly possible for the exemplar of the Law to be allowed to err himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;: Ahmed, Shahab. “Ibn Taymiyyah and the Satanic Verses.” &lt;em&gt;Studia Islamica&lt;/em&gt;, no. 87, 1998, pp. 67–124. &lt;em&gt;JSTOR&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1595926&quot;&gt; www.jstor.org/stable/1595926&lt;/a&gt;. Accessed 8 June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, subsequent generations of Muslims were compelled to outright deny this incident in order to defend the honor of Islam. Consequently, they resorted to fabricating falsehoods and feeble excuses as a means to disavow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the predicament with fabrications is that they often contradict one another, necessitating the invention of numerous additional lies to conceal a single falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same predicament befell the later generations of Muslims. Initially, they became divided into two groups, each refuting the other based on the teachings of the same Quran and Traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group of Muslims outright denied the occurrence of this incident, asserting that there are no Quranic verses related to it, and all the traditions pertaining to this incident are weak. Therefore, they concluded that the incident never actually took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the second group of Muslims accepted the occurrence of the incident but sought to preserve the honor of Islam through the employment of 'Taweel' (figurative interpretation in Arabic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group found themselves compelled to refute the first group since this incident is indeed mentioned in the Quran itself and is supported by 'authentic' traditions transmitted through different chains of narration. Thus, denying its existence altogether became an untenable position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId492278&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What led the Salaf, the early Muslim generations of the first 200 years, to unanimously assert that the Quran itself serves as evidence for the occurrence of the incident of the Satanic Verses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, despite being an extremist Muslim and an apologist for Islam, wrote about this incident (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007100348/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?ID=611&amp;amp;start=&amp;amp;idfrom=1015&amp;amp;idto=1019&amp;amp;bookid=22&amp;amp;Hashiya=5&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;والمأثور عن السلف &lt;strong&gt;يوافق القرآن بذلك&lt;/strong&gt; ... وأما الذين قرروا ما نقل عن السلف فقالوا هذا منقول نقلا ثابتا لا يمكن القدح فيه&lt;strong&gt; والقرآن يدل عليه&lt;/strong&gt; بقوله ۔۔۔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what has been transmitted from the early generations of Salaf (i.e. this incident is authentic) &lt;strong&gt;aligns with the Quran in this matter&lt;/strong&gt;... As for those who have affirmed what has been transmitted from the early generations, they have stated that it is a confirmed transmission that cannot be criticized, and the Quran proves it through its verses too...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the question is, why did the Salaf (early Muslims of the first 200 years) unanimously assert that the Quran itself serves as evidence for the occurrence of this incident? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is, the presence of the words &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;INTERCESSION&lt;/strong&gt; in these verses of Surah an-Najam make it impossible to deny this incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us look at Suran an-Najm, Verse 53:19-26, once again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Verse 24) Or shall man have whatever he &lt;strong&gt;'desires' (Arabic:&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt; tamannā&lt;/a&gt; تمنی) &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;(Verse 25) To God belong the Last and the First.&lt;br&gt;(Verse 26) How many an angel is there in the heavens whose &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already discussed above, how these verses become totally out of context with the proceeding and preceding verses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we interpret them within the context of the abrogated and deleted Satanic Verses and the entire incident surrounding them (where Muhammad &quot;&lt;strong&gt;desired&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; reconciliation with the Meccans and accepted the &quot;intercession&quot; of pagan goddesses), then these 2 verses of Surah an-Najm immediately assumes a logical and meaningful position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why Salaf Muslims of the first 200 years unanimously accepted the incident of Satanic Verses, while the Quran is itself a witness upon it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId315979&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Even Sahih (authentic) Traditions also prove the occurrence of this incident&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani is considered to be one of the highest authorities upon Hadith by Muslims. He refuted the first group and wrote in his book “Fath-ul-Bari” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وكلها سوى طريق سعيد بن جبير إما ضعيف وإلا منقطع ، لكن كثرة الطرق تدل على أن للقصة أصلا ، مع أن لها طريقين آخرين مرسلين رجالهما على شرط الصحيحين أحدهما ما أخرجه الطبري من طريق يونس بن يزيد عن ابن شهاب حدثني أبو بكر بن عبد الرحمن بن الحارث بن هشام فذكر نحوه، والثاني ما أخرجه أيضا من طريق المعتمر بن سليمان وحماد بن سلمة فرقهما عن داود بن أبي هند عن أبي العالية ۔۔۔ ثم نقل تضعيف ابن العربي والقاضي عياض القصة ثم قال - : ۔۔۔ فإن الطرق إذا كثرت وتباينت مخارجها دل ذلك على أن لها أصلا ، وقد ذكرت أن ثلاثة أسانيد منها على شرط الصحيح ، وهي مراسيل يَحتجُّ بمثلها مَن يحتجُّ بالمرسل ، وكذا من لا يحتج به ، لاعتضاد بعضها ببعض ۔۔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the paths of this hadith are either weak or cut off, except for that of Sa`id ibn Jubayr… However, the profusion of the chains show that the story has a basis, furthermore, there are two other “mursal” chains whose narrators are those of Bukhari and Muslim. The first one is that narrated by al-Tabari through Yunus ibn Yazid from Ibn Shihab [al-Zuhri]: “Abu Bakr ibn `Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham narrated to me,” etc. The second is what al-Tabari also narrated through al-Mu`tamir ibn Sulayman and Hammad ibn Salama from Dawud ibn Abi Hind from Abu al-`Aliya…. Contrary to what Abu Bakr ibn al-`Arabi and al-Qadi `Iyad have claimed whereby the story has no basis at all…. When the paths of a hadith are many and distinct, it shows that the report has a basis…. So, as I said, there are three sound but ‘&lt;em&gt;mursal&lt;/em&gt;‘ chains for it, among them what meets the criteria of the two Sahihs but for the fact that they are ‘&lt;em&gt;mursal&lt;/em&gt;‘. These constitute proof for both those that accept ‘mursal’ reports as proofs and those that do not, due to the mutual strengthening of the chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence from the Quran itself is so explicit that there is no need for additional traditions to confirm the occurrence of the Satanic Verses incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shed light on the tactics and deceptions employed by some Muslims in the name of &quot;Ilm-ul-Hadith&quot; (Science of Hadith), we have provided a list of 50 Hadiths pertaining to this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Sahih Bukhari briefly mentions this incident twice, offering shorter versions that still substantiate its occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From companion Ibn Abbas in Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;http://qaalarasulallah.com/hadithView.php?ID=1041&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Ibn `Abbas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet prostrated while reciting An-Najm and with him prostrated the Muslims, the pagans, the jinns, and all human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from companion 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud in Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211103073838/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1070&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet recited Surat an-Najm (103) at Mecca and prostrated while reciting it and those who were with him did the same except an old man who took a handful of small stones or earth and lifted it to his forehead and said, 'This is sufficient for me.' Later on, I saw him killed as a non-believer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists, in their attempt to refute the existence of the Satanic Verses incident, argued that these two traditions do not explicitly mention the Satanic Verses. However, this raises the question of why the pagans would prostrate alongside Muhammad and the Muslims if such an incident did not occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, Islamic apologists put forward the following excuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was the &lt;strong&gt;beauty&lt;/strong&gt; of the Quran which made Pagans automatically fall down and to prostrate to Allah when they heard this verse: (&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=53&amp;amp;verse=62&quot;&gt;Suran an-Najm 53:62:&lt;/a&gt; So prostrate to Allah and worship Him).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a flaw in this argument put forth by Islamic apologists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nowhere in these two traditions of Sahih Bukhari is it mentioned that the pagans prostrated due to any perceived &quot;beauty&quot; of the Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quran mentioned prostration to Allah in several places in the Quran, but pagans never prostrated upon them.  Does this imply that the remaining verses of the Quran lack any beauty that the pagans didn't prostrate there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, the preceding verses of the verse of prostration in Surah An-Najm (53:62) actually present a contrasting narrative, i.e. (1) The pagans of Mecca were mocking the Quran, (2) They were playing around with the Quran, and (3) To them, the Quran was not beautiful at all, but rather filled with falsehoods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could then the pagans prostrate with Muhammad and other Muslims after hearing it? Just read these verses yourself which are witness of mocking of the Quran by pagans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=53&amp;amp;verse=59&quot;&gt;Suran an-Najm, verses 59 to 62&lt;/a&gt;) Do you then wonder at this recital (the Quran)? And you laugh at it and weep not, while ye amuse yourselves (while playing games with it)? So, prostrate to Allah and worship [Him].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the preceding verses of the Quran contradict the arguments put forth by Islamic apologists, and it becomes clear that if the pagans prostrated alongside Muhammad, it was undoubtedly due to the occurrence of the Satanic Verses incident. This indicates that Muhammad did indeed praise their goddesses, leading the Meccan pagans to also prostrate alongside him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId860971&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The second group attempted to alter the interpretation of the incident of the Satanic Verses by employing various &quot;Taweels&quot; (i.e., figurative interpretations)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group of Muslims acknowledged the occurrence of the incident of the Satanic Verses based on Quranic verses and numerous traditions. However, they attempted to dismiss it by resorting to &quot;Taweel&quot; (تأويل), which is a figurative interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, Taweel is nothing more than a feeble excuse that lacks substantiation and is merely based on conjecture. Furthermore, Taweel is not aligned with the principles of justice; rather, it is a means of deceiving and undermining justice. Unfortunately, many Muslims still rely on Taweel to protect the reputation of their religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani belonged to this second group and documented the various Taweels concocted by Muslims to defend the honour of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, Ibn Hajar accepted this incident based on multiple traditions. He writes (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the paths of this hadith are either weak or cut off, except for that of Sa`id ibn Jubayr… However, the profusion of the chains show that the story has a basis, furthermore, there are two other “mursal” chains whose narrators are those of Bukhari and Muslim. The first one is that narrated by al-Tabari through Yunus ibn Yazid from Ibn Shihab [al-Zuhri]: “Abu Bakr ibn `Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham narrated to me,” etc. The second is what al-Tabari also narrated through al-Mu`tamir ibn Sulayman and Hammad ibn Salama from Dawud ibn Abi Hind from Abu al-`Aliya…. Contrary to what Abu Bakr ibn al-`Arabi and al-Qadi `Iyad have claimed that this story of Satanic Verses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; has no basis at all…. When the paths of a hadith are many and distinct, it shows that the report has a basis…. So, as I said, there are three sound but ‘&lt;em&gt;mursal&lt;/em&gt;‘ chains for it, among them what meets the criteria of the two Sahihs but for the fact that they are ‘&lt;em&gt;mursal&lt;/em&gt;‘. These constitute proof for both those that accept ‘mursal’ reports as proofs and those that do not, due to the mutual strengthening of the chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar argued the necessity of presenting Taweel, in order to save the honour of Islam. He continues (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وإذا تقرر ذلك تعين تأويل ما وقع فيها مما يستنكر وهو قوله : &quot; ألقى الشيطان على لسانه : تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى &quot; فإن ذلك لا يجوز حمله على ظاهره لأنه يستحيل عليه - صلى الله عليه وسلم - أن يزيد في القرآن عمدا ما ليس منه ، وكذا سهوا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This said, it is required to interpret the incident (i.e. to do TAWEEL) and address what appears to be reprehensible, namely the statement 'the devil interjected the Satanic Verses upon the Prophet's tongue (i.e. &quot;Those pagan goddesses are the elevated cranes: truly their intercession is dearly hoped). Such a thing is precluded from being accepted in literal terms for it is impossible for the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - to add something to the Qur'an that does not belong to it whether deliberately (`amdan) &lt;strong&gt;or erroneously (sahwan)&lt;/strong&gt;. ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disagree with Ibn Hajar's reasoning. &quot;Justice&quot; entails accepting facts and evidence as they are, without altering them for the sake of preserving the honour of religion and the Prophet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This so-called Taweel (i.e., figurative interpretation) is essentially an act that undermines justice by relying on conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId123582&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The First Taweel: Prophet praised pagan gods in those 2 Verses only in order to ridicule them&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar presented the first Taweel that the Prophet actually uttered the praise of pagan goddesses in order to ridicule them (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وقد رد ذلك عياض فأجاد . وقيل لعله قالها توبيخا للكفار ، قال عياض . وهذا جائز إذا كانت هناك قرينة تدل على المراد . ولا سيما وقد كان الكلام في ذلك الوقت في الصلاة جائزا - وإلى هذا نحا الباقلاني . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Qadi `Iyad did well when he said: 'It is possible the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - was mentioning the belief of the pagans &lt;strong&gt;by way of derision&lt;/strong&gt;, noting that at that time it was permitted to speak in the midst of prayer. To this position leaned Ibn al-Baqillani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conjecture has no weight if it were a mockery of the pagan gods, the pagans would not have prostrated along with Muhammad and other Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId717388&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Second Taweel: It was not the Prophet, but Pagans themselves uttered those 2 Verses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar presented the second Taweel that it was not the prophet, but the Pagans themselves, who uttered those 2 Satanic Verses. He wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقيل إنه لما وصل إلى قوله : &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515#docu&quot;&gt;ومناة الثالثة الأخرى &lt;/a&gt;خشي المشركون أن يأتي بعدها بشيء يذم آلهتهم به فبادروا إلى ذلك الكلام فخلطوه في تلاوة النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - على عادتهم في قولهم . &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515#docu&quot;&gt;لا تسمعوا لهذا القرآن والغوا فيه &lt;/a&gt;ونسب ذلك للشيطان لكونه الحامل لهم على ذلك ، أو المراد بالشيطان شيطان الإنس&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also said that when he reached the words {Have ye thought upon Al Lat and Al Uzza? And Manat, the third, the other?} the pagans feared lest he would add something to mock their gods, so they hastened to interject and jeer so as to cover up what was coming next, as was their habit stated in the verse { And those who disbelieve say: 'Listen not to this Quran, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome.'} (41:26). This act on their part was attributed to the devil as it was he that inspired it to them. Or, what was meant by the devil was the devil of humankind (i.e. it were Pagans themselves who uttered those Satanic Verses)....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, it is evident that this figurative interpretation (Taweel) is solely based on conjecture, contradicting both the Quran and the 50 traditions that discuss this incident. The Quran does not mention any noise made by the pagans, but rather emphasizes the &quot;desire&quot; of the Prophet and Satan's influence in inserting the Satanic verses into his desire. Subsequently, Allah expresses anger towards the Prophet, threatens him with double punishment, and ultimately abrogates those verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId110935&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Third Taweel: The Prophet was neither misled by Satan nor he uttered those 2 Verses, but it was Satan who directly spoke those 2 verses in the voice of the prophet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar presented the third Taweel, that it was Satan who spoke those Satanic Verses in the voice of the Prophet (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقيل : كان النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - يرتل القرآن فارتصده الشيطان في سكتة من السكتات ونطق بتلك الكلمات محاكيا نغمته بحيث سمعه من دنا إليه فظنها من قوله وأشاعها . قال : وهذا أحسن الوجوه&lt;strong&gt; .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was reciting the Quran with measured recitation. During one of the pauses, Satan seized the opportunity and uttered those words, imitating the Prophet's tone in such a way that those who were nearby heard it and thought it was from the Prophet. They then spread it as if it were his words. This, it is said, is the best of the interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, how can this conjecture be accepted when the Quran is so clear that indeed Muhammad was mislead due to this DESIRE? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId939635&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fourth Taweel: The meaning of 'Tamana تمني' in this verse is not '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/span&gt;', but it means '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;RECITATION&lt;/span&gt;'&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar mentioned another excuse that the meaning of 'Tamana تمني' does not only '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to desire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;', but it also has another meaning of '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to recite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;' (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قال : ومعنى قوله : في أمنيته أي في تلاوته ، فأخبر تعالى في هذه الآية أن سنته في رسله إذا قالوا قولا زاد الشيطان فيه من قبل نفسه ، فهذا نص في أن الشيطان زاده في قول النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - لا أن النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - قاله قال : وقد سبق إلى ذلك الطبري لجلالة قدره وسعة علمه وشدة ساعده في النظر فصوب على هذا المعنى وحوم عليه .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The meaning of 'omniyyatihi' in verse 52 (of Surah al-Hajj) is '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;recitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'. Allah Almighty therefore informed us in this verse that His establish practice with His messengers is that if they (i.e. messengers) recite something, Satan adds to it this recitation from himself. This is a clear proof that Satan added something to what the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, not that the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself said it (due to his desire).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Our Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists soon realised that till the time the word 'Desire تمني' (i.e. the prophet got mislead due to his desire) is present in the Quran, they have no chance to defend the prophet by making any excuse/conjecture/Taweel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the next step, they altogether changed the meaning of 'Tamana تمني' from '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;' to '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this change, their modified translation is as following:&lt;/p&gt;

[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Link to many of these modified translations&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The word تَمَنَّىٰ is a verb, while أُمْنِيَّتِهِ is a noun, and both mean 'to desire'. However, Islamic apologists changed both to 'to recite'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Readers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The correct translation of the word 'تمني' is indeed &quot;desire&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the translation of &quot;&lt;strong&gt;recitation&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is indeed false and it was fabricated by some later Muslim scholars to defend the incident of Satanic Verses. It is indeed shameful that many Muslim Scholars propagated this falsehood, which goes against honesty. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even many Muslim Translators didn't accept this falsehood and translated it correctly (i.e. they used the word 'desire' instead of 'recitation'). We invite people to go this &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof 2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed earlier, both these verses in Surah an-Najm and Surah al-Hajj pertain to the same incident of Satanic Verses. In verse 24 of Surah an-Najm, the meaning of 'Tamana تمني' clearly indicates 'desire'. Therefore, it is logical to interpret the usage of 'Tamana تمني' in verse 52 of Surah al-Hajj in the same context of 'desire'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Surah al-Najm, Verse 24) Or shall man have whatever he '&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;' (Arabic:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; tamannā&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; تمنی)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof 3&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 50 traditions about the incident of Satanic Verses are unanimously telling that the prophet indeed got mislead due to his 'desire'. How can you neglect all these traditions, and then change the meaning of (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tamannā&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; تمنی) only based upon your conjecture? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof 4&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence in the whole Arabic literature (pre-Islamic, in the Quran &amp;amp; Hadith, and even after Islam) that the term 'Tamana تمني' also means 'recitation'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is only a &lt;strong&gt;SINGLE&lt;/strong&gt; instance in the &lt;strong&gt;whole&lt;/strong&gt; history of Arabic Literature, where it has been claimed that it could also mean &quot;recitation&quot;. It was a poem attributed to Hassan Ibn Thabit where the word 'Tamana تمني' is claimed to be used to mean recitation. However, even this single occasion is also DOUBTFUL as this narration is weak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim Scholar Ibn Aashoor writes in his book &quot;al-Tahrir wa al-Tanwir&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/22/53&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

  &quot; href=&quot;https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/22/53&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;التحرير والتنوير — ابن عاشور (١٣٩٣ هـ)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وقَدْ فَسَّرَ كَثِيرٌ مِنَ المُفَسِّرِينَ (تَمَنّى) بِمَعْنى قَرَأ. وتَبِعَهم أصْحابُ كُتُبِ اللُّغَةِ وذَكَرُوا بَيْتًا نَسَبُوهُ إلى &lt;strong&gt;حَسّانَ بْنِ ثابِتٍ وذَكَرُوا قِصَّةً بِرِواياتٍ ضَعِيفَةٍ سَنَذْكُرُها ...&lt;/strong&gt; وعِنْدِي في صِحَّةِ إطْلاقِ لَفْظِ الأُمْنِيَّةِ عَلى القِراءَةِ شَكٌّ عَظِيمٌ، فَإنَّهُ وإنْ كانَ قَدْ ورَدَ تَمَنّى بِمَعْنى قَرَأ في بَيْتٍ &lt;strong&gt;نُسِبَ إلى حَسّانَ بْنِ ثابِتٍ إنْ صَحَّتْ رِوايَةُ البَيْتِ عَنْ حَسّانَ &lt;/strong&gt;... &lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;فَلا أظُنُّ أنَّ القِراءَةَ يُقالُ لَها أُمْنِيَّةٌ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many interpreters have explained 'tamanā' (تَمَنَّى) as meaning 'read.' This interpretation is followed by scholars of the Arabic language, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;who have cited a poem attributed to Hassan ibn Thabit and mentioned a story &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;with weak chains of narration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that we will discuss ... &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personally, I have significant doubts about the accuracy of using the term 'amnīyah' (أُمْنِيَّة) to refer to 'recitation,'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; despite the fact that the term 'tamanā' has been used in a verse attributed to Hassan ibn Thabit ... &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do not believe that 'recitation' should be referred to as 'amnīyah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Ibn Aashoor furhter wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/22/53&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عَمُوا أنَّ (تَمَنّى) بِمَعْنى: قَرَأ، والأُمْنِيَّةُ: القِراءَةُ، وهو ادِّعاءٌ لا يُوثَقُ بِهِ ولا يُوجَدُ لَهُ شاهِدٌ صَرِيحٌ في كَلامِ العَرَبِ. وأنْشَدُوا بَيْتًا لِحَسّانَ بْنِ ثابِتٍ في رِثاءِ عُثْمانَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;poetry&quot;&gt;تَمَنّى كِتابَ اللَّهِ أوَّلَ لَيْلِهِ ∗∗∗ وآخِرَهُ لاقى حِمامَ المَقادِرِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وهُوَ مُحْتَمَلٌ أنَّ مَعْناهُ تَمَنّى أنْ يَقْرَأ القُرْآنَ في أوَّلِ اللَّيْلِ عَلى عادَتِهِ فَلَمْ يَتَمَكَّنْ مِن ذَلِكَ بِتَشْغِيبِ أهْلِ الحِصارِ عَلَيْهِ وقَتَلُوهُ آخِرَ اللَّيْلِ. ولِهَذا جَعَلَهُ تَمَنِّيًا لِأنَّهُ أحَبَّ ذَلِكَ فَلَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have claimed that 'tamanā' (تَمَنَّى) means 'to read,' and that 'amnīyah' (الأُمْنِيَّة) refers to 'recitation,' &lt;strong&gt;but this assertion is not reliable and lacks clear evidence in Arabic language usage&lt;/strong&gt;. They have cited a verse attributed to Hassan ibn Thabit in praise of Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;تَمَنّى كِتابَ اللَّهِ أوَّلَ لَيْلِهِ ∗∗∗ وآخِرَهُ لاقى حِمامَ المَقادِرِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this verse might also imply that he &lt;strong&gt;wished&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to read&lt;/strong&gt; the Quran at the beginning of the night according to his practice, but was unable to do so due to the disturbance from the besiegers who killed him at the end of the night. Therefore, his &lt;strong&gt;wish&lt;/strong&gt; was considered unfulfilled because he loved it but could not achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see the double standards of Islamic apologists? They rejected the whole Arabic literature, which unanimously used 'tamanā' (تَمَنَّى) as 'desire'. Instead, they went without any proof for a 'singular' and a weak source, which claims that 'Tamana تمني' means 'recitation'. This is indeed dishonesty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId965765&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Excuse by Modern Islamic apologists: Surah al-Hajj was revealed 8 years after Surah an-Najm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Islamic apologists also deny the existence of the incident of Satanic Verses on the basis of this argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surah al-Hajj was revealed 8 years after Surah an-Najm. How is it possible to accept that Allah will reveal verses about one incident 8 years after it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument holds no weight as it is widely known that the Quran is not arranged in chronological order. Each surah contains verses from various incidents that occurred at different times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Quran is characterized by its lack of coherence to such an extent that within a single verse, one part may refer to one incident while the second part addresses a completely different incident that took place years apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/5.3&quot;&gt;Quran 5:3)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةُ وَٱلدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ ٱلْخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِۦ وَٱلْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَٱلْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَٱلْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَٱلنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ ٱلسَّبُعُ إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى ٱلنُّصُبِ وَأَن تَسْتَقْسِمُوا۟ بِٱلْأَزْلَٰمِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ ۗ ٱلْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن دِينِكُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَٱخْشَوْنِ ۚ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِى وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلْإِسْلَٰمَ دِينًا ۚ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ فِى مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لِّإِثْمٍ ۙ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1st part of the verse):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, and the strangled (animal) and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2nd part of the verse):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3rd part of the verse):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the consensus of Quran commentators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first segment of this verse pertains to the prohibition of certain foods, and it was revealed during the sixth year of the Hijri calendar, specifically during the time of the Hudaybiyyah Pact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the second (middle) segment of this verse abruptly shifts its focus to the &quot;Perfection of Religion,&quot; and this portion was revealed at a completely different time during the tenth year of the Hijri calendar. It is unrelated to the preceding segment of the verse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third and final segment of the verse returns to the initial incident regarding the prohibited foods, which was revealed during the Hudaybiyyah Pact in the sixth year of the Hijri calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his Quranic commentary, Maulana Modoodi stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;According to authentic traditions, the second segment of the verse, which addresses the perfection of religion, was revealed during the 'Last Sermon' in the tenth year of the Hijri calendar. However, the initial segment of the verse pertains to the Hudaybiyyah Pact (which occurred in the sixth year of the Hijri calendar).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId575198&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The initial verses of Surah an-Najm became a significant factor that later compelled Muslims to completely deny the incident of Satanic Verses.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Muhammad introduced his new religion and claimed to receive revelations from an Angel sent by God, the people of Mecca ridiculed him and accused him of being misled by Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counter this accusation, Muhammad recited Surah an-Najm in a gathering of Meccans, specifically the beginning verses of the Surah. In these verses, he vehemently denied being astray or misled, stating that his words were not driven by personal desire, but rather divine revelation taught to him by a mighty power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial verses of this Surah are as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/53.1?context=5&quot;&gt;Suran an-Najm, Verses 1 to 5&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the Star when it goes down,- Your Companion [Muhammad] is &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;neither astray nor being misled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire. It is naught but revelation that is revealed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which one of mighty powers has taught him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, within the same Surah, Muhammad later affirmed the charge of being misled by Satan, acknowledging that he indeed went astray and got mislead and had mistakenly praised the pagan gods under Satan's influence. This admission contradicted the initial verses of Surah an-Najm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proves human error in what was presented by Muhammad as divine revelation. It opens the door to questioning the existence of Allah in the heavens and considering that Muhammad could have been the sole originator of these revelations, vulnerable to making human mistakes in their transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiating between the real incident of the Satanic Verses and the fictitious novel by Salman Rushdie is of utmost importance. The authentic incident sheds light on the fallibility within the claimed divine revelation, challenging the existence of a heavenly Allah and suggesting that Muhammad himself was responsible for the revelation, resulting in human errors within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other event exposes the human errors within the alleged divine revelation as clearly as the original incident of the Satanic Verses. Unfortunately, a vast majority of people, including Muslims, are unaware of this significant event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of awareness can be attributed to the confusion caused by Mr. Rushdie's fictional novel, also titled &quot;Satanic Verses,&quot; which bears little resemblance to the actual incident. Regrettably, this misunderstanding has prevented the true incident of the Satanic Verses from reaching the masses. Presently, people struggle to distinguish between reality and fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists have capitalized on this situation, exploiting it to incite hatred among Muslim youth against the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Rushdie cannot be held responsible for this situation, as he is an intelligent writer who observed contradictions within the purported divine revelation, he was neither an Islamic scholar nor equipped to withstand the ensuing life-threatening attacks. The responsibility to make the world aware of the original incident primarily lies with scholars of Islamic studies and perhaps ex-Muslims as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of Islamic Studies, significant scholarly research on the incident of the Satanic Verses emerged in 2017 with the publication of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nes.princeton.edu/publications/contributor/ahmed-shahab&quot;&gt;Mr. Shahab Ahmed's&lt;/a&gt; book titled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Before-Orthodoxy-Satanic-Verses-Early-ebook/dp/B0747JQKKV/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QL2JE8QNYVFN&amp;amp;keywords=Before+Orthodoxy%3A+The+Satanic+Verses+in+Early+Islam&amp;amp;qid=1660673380&amp;amp;sprefix=before+orthodoxy+the+satanic+verses+in+early+islam%2Caps%2C437&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Before Orthodoxy: The Satanic Verses in Early Islam.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; This groundbreaking work encompasses a collection of 50 traditions related to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Shahab Ahmed, a brilliant individual, authored an extraordinary book. However, it remains incomplete as he intended to write the second and third volumes before his untimely death in 2015 at the age of 48 due to leukemia. His passing was a profound loss. Nevertheless, we are fortunate that the first volume of his remarkable work was published in 2017 even after his demise. We express gratitude to all those involved in making the publication of this book possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us now present the actual incident of the Satanic Verses, highlighting its importance and emphasizing why it is crucial for the entire world to be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ancient Mecca, the pagan society was characterized by illiteracy and superstition. They worshipped multiple gods and were open to the introduction of new deities, as evidenced by the presence of 360 idols in the Ka'ba, each representing different tribes. However, they fiercely opposed anyone who questioned the authenticity of their gods, particularly because their economy was intertwined with the worship of these deities. The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca brought wealth and prosperity to the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Muhammad established his new religion, he made the mistake of challenging the pagan gods, asserting that they were false. This threatened the Meccans' religious and economic interests, as they feared losing the significance of their gods. Prior to Muhammad, both Jews and Christians had made similar attempts to disprove pagan gods, but they had failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the people of Mecca vehemently reacted against Muhammad and his followers. The situation became so hostile that many of his followers were forced to flee Mecca and seek refuge in Abyssinia to save their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing his error, Muhammad devised a new plan to reconcile with the Meccans. He aimed to convince them to accept Allah as a new god and himself as a prophet by praising their pagan gods. As part of this plan, Muhammad began expressing his &quot;desire&quot; for Allah to acknowledge the high status of the Meccan gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a gathering of the Quraysh, Muhammad claimed that Allah had started revealing messages to him through the angel Gabriel. It was on this occasion that he recited Surah an-Najm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Surah an-Najm, Muhammad also acknowledged the pagan goddesses and praised their elevated status and ability to intercede. This praise consisted of a total of four verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَاللاتِ وَالْعُزَّى وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةِ الأُخْرَى، فَإِنَّهُنَّ الْغَرَانِيقُ الْعُلَى وَإِنَّ شفاعتهن لَتُرْتَجَى&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 1: Have you pondered upon al-Lat and al-Uzza, the goddesses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 2: And Manat, the third goddess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 3: These (3 goddesses) are like high flying cranes (i.e. they are of high status);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 4: Verily their intercession is accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon completing Surah an-Najm, Muhammad prostrated himself, and the Quraysh also followed suit, accepting the elevated status of their goddesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan goddesses were given a resemblance to high-flying cranes while 'high flying', metaphorically meant flying high close to the heavens where Allah is physically present - to act as intercessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad's plan ultimately failed, as people observed clear contradictions in the divine revelation. Previous revelations had consistently denounced pagan gods as false deities, while this new revelation affirmed their authenticity, high status, and ability to intercede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the Meccan pagans easily concluded that Allah did not exist in the heavens and that Muhammad himself was fabricating these revelations. They ridiculed Muhammad even more after this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with the failure of his plan, Muhammad resorted to a new narrative. He claimed that Allah had not revealed anything about the elevated status of the pagan gods, but rather, it was his own mistake. He asserted that Satan had led him astray, resulting in the utterance of the two Satanic Verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this newly made story, Muhammad told Quraysh that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad received a visit from Gabriel in the evening, who requested him to repeat the verses previously revealed to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, Muhammad recited before Gabriel the verses that praised the gods worshipped by the Quraysh, unaware that these were the Satanic verses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon hearing this, Gabriel informed Muhammad that those verses were not the ones originally conveyed by Allah, but were in fact the Satanic verses that Satan had caused him to recite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following this revelation, Muhammad proclaimed that Allah had sent two additional verses as divine revelation, which are as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Surah Hajj 22:52-53&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وَمَا أَرْ‌سَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّ‌سُولٍ وَلَا نَبِيٍّ إِلَّا إِذَا &lt;strong&gt;تَمَنَّىٰ&lt;/strong&gt; أَلْقَى الشَّيْطَانُ فِي &lt;strong&gt;أُمْنِيَّتِهِ فَيَنسَخُ &lt;/strong&gt;اللَّـهُ مَا يُلْقِي الشَّيْطَانُ ثُمَّ يُحْكِمُ اللَّـهُ آيَاتِهِ ۗ وَاللَّـهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ۔ لِيَجْعَلَ مَا يُلْقِي الشَّيْطَانُ فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ وَالْقَاسِيَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ لَفِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ&lt;/p&gt;
And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;strong&gt;desires' (Arabic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; تمنی)&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his &lt;strong&gt;desire (Arabic: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:15%29&quot;&gt;um'niyyatihi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; أُمْنِيَّتِهِ)&lt;/strong&gt;, so God &lt;strong&gt;'abrogates' &lt;/strong&gt;what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His verses precise again (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). And Allah is Knowing and Wise. He (Allah) makes, what is thrown in by Shaitan (Satan), a &lt;strong&gt;Test &lt;/strong&gt;for those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy and disbelief) and whose hearts are hardened. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two new verses of Surah al-Hajj served multiple purposes, which can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: One objection raised by the pagans was why Muhammad, being the chosen prophet of Allah, could be misled by Satan. To address this objection, Muhammad clarified through these verses that his momentary misguidance did not undermine the divine nature of his religion. He explained that all previous prophets had also experienced similar temptations from Satan due to their human desires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Muhammad needed to eliminate the presence of the Satanic Verses, which praised the pagan goddesses, from the Quran. To achieve this objective, the new verses revealed that Allah had abrogated and rectified what the devil had inserted. This emphasized that Allah's true verses were made precise again, nullifying any influence from Satan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Third Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: The pagans questioned why Allah had allowed Satan to misguide Muhammad and why any mistakes in the verses were not corrected immediately. In response, Muhammad offered an explanation that Allah had permitted Satan's interference as a &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; for those whose hearts harbored diseases or weaknesses. This excuse presented it as an opportunity for individuals to demonstrate their steadfastness and faithfulness. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9729%; height: 168px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 80%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 168px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: rgb(254, 253, 234); text-align: left; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid rgb(224, 62, 45); height: 168px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: It is worth noting that Muhammad utilized this tactic of declaring &quot;mistakes&quot; of Allah as &quot;TEST&quot; from Allah on various occasions throughout his life. For example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mod-articles-category-title &quot; href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/quran-2/322-abrogation-of-bayt-al-muqaddas-as-qibla-due-to-jewish-enmity&quot;&gt;Abrogation of Bayt al-Maqdis as Qibla due to Jewish Enmity&lt;/a&gt; [Excuse: It was a TEST]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mod-articles-category-title &quot; href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/52-why-did-allah-wrongly-accepted-that-uthman-was-killed-in-hudaybiyyah&quot;&gt;Why did Allah WRONGLY assume that Uthman was killed in Hudaybiyyah?&lt;/a&gt; [Excuse: It was a Test]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, after all these modifications and deletion of verses in the name of “abrogation” (نسخ) and deletion, today Surah an-Najm is present in this form in the Quran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9729%; height: 522.667px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 7.07131%;&quot;&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 53.7257%;&quot;&gt;&lt;col style=&quot;width: 39.1767%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;height: 34.6667px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Verily their intercession is accepted&lt;/td&gt;

Their aim was to refute Satanic Verses (i.e. to deny that Pagan goddesses have any high Ranks with Allah). &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 24px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 24px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 24px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;What a bizarre distribution. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 72px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 72px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 72px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;These are nothing but names, which you have devised, you and your ancestors, for which God sent down no authority. They follow nothing but assumptions, and what the ego desires, even though guidance has come to them from their Lord.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 96px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 96px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 96px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Or shall man have whatever he '&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;' (Arabic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تمنی&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 96px; background-color: rgb(254, 253, 234); border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Muhammad introduced an additional verse to Surah an-Najm, aiming to provide him with protection regarding his previous '&lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt;' where he expressed a wish for Allah to reveal something favorable about the pagan gods.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 47.875px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 47.875px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 47.875px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;To God belong the Last and the First.&lt;/td&gt;

These new verses suggested that although angels also reside/fly high in the heavens near Allah (similar to the high-flying pagan goddesses), their &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; is not granted unless permitted by Allah.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 93.4583px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 93.4583px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;height: 93.4583px; border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;How many an angel is there in the heavens whose &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId74363&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The words DESIRE and INTERCESSION in these verses make it impossible to deny the incident of Satanic Verses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that Islamic apologists today deny that verses 19 to 26 of Surah an-Najm have anything to do with the incident of Satanic Verses, as they deny the occurrence of this incident altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the presence of the words DESIRE and INTERCESSION in these verses is very important, as it makes it impossible for them to deny the occurrence of this incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Verse 24):  Or shall man have whatever he &lt;strong&gt;'desires' (Arabic:&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt; tamannā&lt;/a&gt; تمنی) &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;(Verse 25): To God belong the Last and the First.&lt;br&gt;(Verse 26): How many an angel is there in the heavens whose &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of verse 24 in Surah an-Najm  ( &lt;strong&gt;أَمْ لِلْإِنسَانِ مَا &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تَمَنَّىٰ&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Or shall man have whatever he '&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'?&lt;/strong&gt;), provides evidence supporting the authenticity of the incident known as the Satanic Verses as mentioned in the 50 Traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to note that verse 24, which focuses on fulfilling human &lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;, is totally unrelated (out of context) to the preceding verses that discuss the denial of the high status of pagan gods. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Similarly, this &quot;desire&quot; also has nothing to do with the &lt;strong&gt;proceeding&lt;/strong&gt; verses (which talk about the intercession of angels). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this context, the inclusion of verse 24 at this particular point appears illogical and lacks coherence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we accept the incident of Satanic Verses indeed happened (as mentioned in those 50 Traditions), then verse 24 of Surah an-Najm immediately starts making &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sense&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;logic&lt;/strong&gt; at this place. It proves that the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) later included this verse 24 (about getting what man desires) here, in order to counter the incident of Satanic Verses, in which he had previously told Meccans about his '&lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;' for reconciliation with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the word '&lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt;' in verse 26 of Surah an-Najm also proves that indeed this verse was also linked to the incident of Satanic Verses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Surah an-Najm, Verse 26)&lt;/strong&gt; How many angels are there in the heavens whose &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, it is evident that the inclusion of the verse regarding the 'intercession of angels' lacks any relevance to the surrounding verses. It is out of place and fails to contribute any logical or meaningful connection to the context of the preceding or subsequent verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we accept that the incident of Satanic Verses indeed happened (as mentioned in those 50 Traditions), then verse 26 immediately starts making perfect sense and perfect logic at this place, while the two abrogated/deleted Satanic Verses were talking about the &quot;intercession&quot; of pagan goddesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It proves that the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) revealed this new verse about the intercession of angels here in order to refute the Satanic Verses, which affirmed the intercession of pagan goddesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional two verses about the same incident of Satanic Verses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two additional verses are as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first verse is from Surah al-Hajj:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Surah Hajj 22:52&lt;/a&gt;) And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his &lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;, so God &lt;strong&gt;'abrogates' &lt;/strong&gt;what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His &lt;strong&gt;verses precise again&lt;/strong&gt; (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). And Allah is Knowing and Wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second verse is from Surah Bani Israel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt; 17:73-75&lt;/a&gt;) And indeed,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;they were about to&lt;strong&gt; tempt you away from that which We revealed&lt;/strong&gt; to you in order to [make] you &lt;strong&gt;INVENT about Us something else (i.e. the Satanic Verses)&lt;/strong&gt;; and then they would have taken you &lt;strong&gt;as a friend&lt;/strong&gt;. And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little &lt;strong&gt;(i.e. Muhammad's DESIRE to reconciliate with them)&lt;/strong&gt;. Then [if you had], We would have made you taste &lt;strong&gt;double [punishment in] life and double [after] death&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the verses mentioned above were revealed in response to the incident of the Satanic Verses. However, later Muslims dispersed these verses throughout different chapters of the Quran, intentionally preventing readers from finding them in one place to avoid raising questions about the incident of Satanic Verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId752021&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why do Islamic apologists try to deny the connection between verse 22:52 of Surah al-Hajj and the incident of the Satanic Verses?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists deny any &lt;strong&gt;link&lt;/strong&gt; between these verses of Surah an-Najm and Surah al-Hajj as they deny the whole incident of Satanic Verses and those 50 Traditions about them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Surah al-Hajj is a witness that indeed abrogation &amp;amp; deletion (in the name of cleaning filth) of Quranic verses took place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Surah Hajj 22:52&lt;/a&gt;) And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his &lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;, so God &lt;strong&gt;'abrogates' &lt;/strong&gt;what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His &lt;strong&gt;verses precise again&lt;/strong&gt; (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). And Allah is Knowing and Wise. He (Allah) makes, what is thrown in by Shaitan (Satan), a &lt;strong&gt;Test&lt;/strong&gt; for those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy and disbelief) and whose hearts are hardened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, which were the verses which were abrogated and then deleted in the name of making the Quran precise again? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 50 traditions are unanimous that it was Surah an-Najm, in which Satanic Verses were abrogated and then deleted for making the Quran precise again. Thus, these verses of Surah al-Hajj and Surah an-Najm are directly linked to each other and are about the same incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Islamic apologists today deny any link between these verses of Surah al-Hajj and Surah an-Najm, then they have to tell us: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which were those verses that were abrogated and then deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And why were they abrogated and why were they deleted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the occurrence of the word &quot;DESIRE&quot; ('&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; تمنی&lt;/strong&gt;') in both verses of Surah an-Najm and Surah al-Hajj also proves they are LINKED with each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Suran an-Najm, Verse 24)&lt;/strong&gt; Or shall man have whatever he '&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;' (Arabic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تمنی&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Surah Hajj 22:52&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;' &lt;strong&gt;(Arabic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tamannā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تمنی&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his desire (Arabic: &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:15%29&quot;&gt;um'niyyatihi&lt;/a&gt; أُمْنِيَّتِهِ), so God 'abrogates' what the devil throws in. Then Allah makes His verses precise again (by deleting the abrogated Satanic verses). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, these Quranic Verses themselves prove that those 50 traditions are correct about the incident of Satanic Verses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why are Islamic apologists compelled to deny the connection between verses &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt;17:73-75&lt;/a&gt; of Surah Bani Israel and the incident of the Satanic Verses? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Islamic apologists are compelled to deny any link between verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt;17:73-75&lt;/a&gt; of Surah Bani Israel and the incident of Satanic Verses. It is due to TWO mistakes that Muhammad made while composing this verse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt; 17:73-75&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;they were about to&lt;strong&gt; tempt you away from that which We revealed&lt;/strong&gt; to you in order to [make] you &lt;strong&gt;INVENT about Us something else (i.e. the Satanic Verses)&lt;/strong&gt;; and then they would have taken you &lt;strong&gt;as a friend&lt;/strong&gt;. And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little &lt;strong&gt;(i.e. Muhammad's DESIRE to reconciliate with them)&lt;/strong&gt;. Then [if you had], We would have made you taste &lt;strong&gt;double [punishment in] life and double [after] death&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad sought to deflect the blame for the Satanic Verses away from Allah and onto himself. It was crucial to absolve Allah of any responsibility, emphasizing that Satan has no power over Allah and that He is infallible. Failure to do so could have jeopardized the foundation of the entire new religion of Muhammad. To strengthen his position, Muhammad revealed the subsequent verse, creating the impression that Allah was displeased with him for this mistake and even threatened him with double punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Syuti recorded the following tradition in his Tafsir under the verse 17:73 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=17&amp;amp;tAyahNo=73&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وأخرج ابن أبي حاتم عن محمد بن كعب القرظي رضي الله عنه قال: أنزل الله{ والنجم إذا هوى } [النجم: 1] فقرأ عليهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم هذه الآية{ أفرأيتم اللات والعزى } [النجم: 19] فألقى عليه الشيطان كلمتين: لك الغرانيق العلى، وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى. فقرأ النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ما بقي من السورة وسجد، فأنزل الله { وإن كادوا ليفتنونك عن الذي أوحينا إليك... } الآية. فما زال مغموماً مهموماً حتى أنزل الله تعالى{ وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي... } [الحج: 52] الآية.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurazi (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Allah revealed {By the star when it descends} [An-Najm: 1], and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) recited this verse to them: {Have you considered al-Lat and al-'Uzza?} [An-Najm: 19]. Satan then cast two phrases upon him: &quot;These are the exalted cranes (idols), and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for.&quot; The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) recited the remainder of the surah and prostrated. Then Allah revealed {And indeed, they were about to tempt you away from that which We revealed to you...} [Al-Isra: 73]. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) remained in a state of grief and distress until Allah revealed {And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet...} [Al-Hajj: 52].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Islamic apologists deny it, as they cannot let this verse to be linked to the incident of Satanic Verses while Muhammad made two fatal mistakes in this verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Mistake: This verse claims that Muhammad could get double punishment for his &quot;Unintentional&quot; Mistake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an important question arises: punishment is typically reserved for intentional mistakes. According to the Quran, Muhammad did not recite the Satanic Verses deliberately; he genuinely believed that Allah had fulfilled his desire, and Gabriel had brought those verses from Allah. If Allah had allowed Satan to misguide the prophet, why should the prophet be subjected to double punishment for an unintentional error?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Mistake: This verse claims it was not the Devil who misguided Muhammad for adding Satanic Verses, but it were Meccans who misguided Muhammad in doing it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the verse again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=17&amp;amp;verse=73&quot;&gt; 17:73-75&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;they&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. Pagan Meccans) were about to&lt;strong&gt; tempt you away from that which We revealed&lt;/strong&gt; to you in order to [make] you &lt;strong&gt;INVENT about Us something else (i.e. the Satanic Verses)&lt;/strong&gt;; and then &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would have taken you &lt;strong&gt;as a friend&lt;/strong&gt;. And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a little &lt;strong&gt;(i.e. Muhammad's DESIRE to reconciliate with them)&lt;/strong&gt;. Then [if you had], We would have made you taste &lt;strong&gt;double [punishment in] life and double [after] death&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad was only human and naturally prone to making such errors while composing the verses himself. He forgot that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He had already blamed the Devil for his misguidance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And he had already claimed that he didn't &lt;strong&gt;INVENT&lt;/strong&gt; anything &lt;strong&gt;intentionally&lt;/strong&gt;, but it was the devil who inserted those 2 verses. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next step, Islamic apologists fabricated seven different traditions to disconnect this verse from the incident of the Satanic Verses. However, as with all lies, contradictions emerged in all these 7 traditions, with each claiming a separate incident for the revelation of the same verse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read these seven traditions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www-altafsir-com.translate.goog/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=17&amp;amp;tAyahNo=73&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&amp;amp;_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically, this verse was revealed in connection with only one incident. Moreover, the verse itself, with its references to temptation and inventing something new about Allah, fits the context of the Satanic Verses incident perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamists should be condemn for fabrication of thousands of such traditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId29472&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Incident of Satanic Verses in Traditions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Jarir al-Tabari recorded the following tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/3475_%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A2/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_75#top&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حدثنا ابن حميد قال حدثنا سلمة قال حدثني محمد بن إسحاق عن يزيد بن زياد المدني عن محمد بن كعب القرظي قال لما رأى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم تولى قومه عنه وشق عليه ما يرى من مباعدتهم ما جاءهم به من الله &lt;strong&gt;تمنى &lt;/strong&gt;في نفسه أن يأتيه من الله ما يقارب بينه وبين قومه وكان يسره مع حبه قومه وحرصه عليهم أن يلين له بعض ما قد غلظ عليه من أمرهم حتى حدث بذلك نفسه وتمناه وأحبه فأنزل الله عز وجل (والنجم إذا هوى ما ضل صاحبكم وما غوى وما ينطق عن الهوى - فلما انتهى إلى قوله - أفرأيتم اللات والعزى ومناة الثالثة الأخرى) ألقى الشيطان على لسانه لما كان يحدث به نفسه ويتمنى أن يأتي به قومه تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن ترتضي فلما سمعت قريش فرحوا وسرهم وأعجبهم ما ذكر به آلهتهم فأصاخوا له والمؤمنون مصدقون نبيهم فيما جاءهم به عن ربهم ولا يتهمونه على خطأ ولا وهم ولا زلل فلما انتهى إلى السجدة منها وختم السورة سجد فيها فسجد المسلمون بسجود نبيهم تصديقا لما جاء به واتباعا لامره وسجد من في المسجد من المشركين من قريش وغيرهم لما سمعوا من ذكر آلهتهم فلم يبق في المسجد مؤمن ولا كافر إلا سجد إلا الوليد بن المغيرة فإنه كان شيخا كبيرا فلم يستطع السجود فاخذ بيده حفنة من البطحاء فسجد عليها ثم تفرق الناس من المسجد وخرجت قريش وقد سرهم ما سمعوا من ذكر آلهتهم يقولون قد ذكر محمد آلهتنا بأحسن الذكر قد زعم فيما يتلو إنها الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن ترتضي وبلغت السجدة من بأرض الحبشة من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وقيل أسلمت قريش فنهض منهم رجال وتخلف آخرون وآتى جبريل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال يا محمد ماذا صنعت لقد تلوت على الناس ما لم آتك به عن الله عز وجل وقلت ما لم يقل لك فحزن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم عند ذلك حزنا شديدا وخاف من الله خوفا كثيرا فأنزل الله عز وجل وكان به رحيما يعزيه ويخفض عليه الامر ويخبره أنه لم يك قبله نبي ولا رسول تمنى كما تمنى ولا أحب كما أحب الا والشيطان قد ألقى في أمنيته كما ألقى على لسانه صلى الله عليه وسلم فنسخ الله ما ألقى الشيطان وأحكم آبائه أي فإنما أنت كبعض الأنبياء والرسل فأنزل الله عز وجل (وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي إلا إذا تمنى ألقى الشيطان في أمنيته فينسخ الله ما يلقى الشيطان ثم يحكم الله آياته والله عليم حكيم) فاذهب الله عز وجل عن نبيه الحزن وآمنه من الذي كان يخاف ونسخ ما ألقى الشيطان على لسانه من ذكر آلهتهم إنها الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن ترتضي بقول الله عز وجل ذكر اللات والعزى ومناة الثلاثة الأخرى (ألكم الذكر وله الأنثى تلك إذا قسمة ضيزى) أي عوجاء (إن هي إلا أسماء سميتموها أنتم وآباؤكم - إلى قوله - لمن يشاء ويرضى) أي فكيف تنفع شفاعة آلهتكم عنده فلما جاء من الله ما نسخ ما كان الشيطان ألقى على لسان نبيه قالت قريش ندم محمد على ما ذكر من منزلة آلهتكم عند الله فغير ذلك وجاء بغيره وكان ذانك الحرفان اللذان ألقى الشيطان على لسان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قد وقعا في فم كل مشرك فازدادوا شرا إلى ما كانوا عليه وشدة على من أسلم &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the messenger of God saw how his tribe turned their backs on him and was grieved to see them shunning the message he had brought to them from God, he &lt;strong&gt;desired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from his soul&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that something would come to him from God which would reconcile him with his tribe. With his love for his tribe and his eagerness for their welfare it would have delighted him if some of the difficulties which they made for him could have been smoothed out, and he debated with himself and fervently desired such an outcome. Then God revealed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Surah an-Najm, verses 1 to 3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;'By the Star when it sets, your comrade does not err, nor is he deceived; nor does he speak out of (his own) desire...'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; and when he came to the words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Surah an-Najm, verses 19 and 20)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Have you thought of al-Lat and al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then Satan cast on his tongue, because of his inner debates and what he &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to bring to his people, the words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Satanic Verse 1) 'These are the high-flying cranes;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Satanic Verse 2) verily their intercession is accepted with approval.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Quraysh heard this, they rejoiced and were happy and delighted at the way in which he spoke of their gods, and they listened to him, while the Muslims, having complete trust in their prophet in respect of the messages which he brought from God, did not suspect him of error, illusion, or mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he came to the prostration, having completed the surah an-Najm, he prostrated himself and the Muslims did likewise, following their prophet, trusting in the message which he had brought and following his example. Those polytheists of the Quraysh and others who were in the mosque likewise prostrated themselves because of the reference to their gods which they had heard, so that there was no one in the mosque, believer or unbeliever, who did not prostrate himself ... The Quraysh left delighted by the mention of their gods which they had heard, saying,'Muhammad has mentioned our gods in the most favorable way possible, stating in his recitation that they are the high-flying cranes and that their intercession is received with approval.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...  Then (later) Gabriel came to the Messenger of God and said, 'Muhammad, what have you done? You have recited to the people that which I did not bring to you from God, and you have said that which was not said to you.' Then the messenger of God was much grieved and feared God greatly, but God sent down a revelation to him, for He was merciful to him, consoling him and making the matter light for him, informing him that there had never been a prophet or a messenger before him who &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as he desired and wished as he wished but that Satan had cast words into his recitation, as he had cast words on Muhammad's tongue. Then God canceled what Satan had thus cast, and established his verses by telling him that he was like other prophets and messengers, and revealed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Surah al-Hajj, verses 52 and 53)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he '&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desires' (Arabic: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;tamannā&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; تمنی)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the devil threw (Satanic Verses) in his &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desire (Arabic: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:15%29&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;um'niyyatihi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; أُمْنِيَّتِهِ)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, so God &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;'abrogates' &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;what the devil throws in، &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;then Allah makes His verses precise again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, God removed the sorrow from his messenger, reassured him about that which he had feared and canceled the words which Satan had cast on his tongue, that their gods were the high-flying cranes whose intercession was accepted with approval. He now revealed, following the mention of 'al-Lat, al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other,' the words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Surah an-Najm, verses 21 to 26)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; 'Are yours the males and his the females? That indeed was an unfair division! They are but names which you have named, you and your fathers ...to whom he wills and accepts ' &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means, how can the intercession of their gods avail with God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Muhammad brought a revelation from God canceling what Satan had cast on the tongue of His prophet, the Quraysh said,'Muhammad has repented of what he said concerning the position of your gods with God, and has altered it and brought something else.' Those two phrases which Satan had cast on the tongue of the Messenger of God were in the mouth of every polytheist, and they became even more ill-disposed and more violent in their persecution of those of them who had accepted Islam and followed the messenger of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Suyuti recorded this incident from an &quot;authentic&quot; chain of narration (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220810224353/http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=22&amp;amp;tAyahNo=52&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وأخرج ابن جرير وابن المنذر وابن أبي حاتم وابن مردويه بسند صحيح، عن سعيد بن جبير قال: قرأ رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بمكة النجم، فلما بلغ هذا الموضع { أفرأيتم اللات والعزى ومناة الثالثة الأخرى } ألقى الشيطان على لسانه تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى. قالوا: ما ذكر آلهتنا بخير قبل اليوم، فسجد وسجدوا، ثم جاءه جبريل بعد ذلك قال: اعرض عليَّ ما جئتك به. فلما بلغ: تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى. قال له جبريل: لم آتك بهذا؛ هذا من الشيطان فأنزل الله { وما أرسلنا من قبلك من رسول ولا نبي }.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Jarir and others recorded through 'Sahih' (authentic) chain of narration from Saeed Ibn Jubayr that the prophet started reciting Surah Najam in Mecca. When he came to verse (&lt;em&gt;Have you thought upon al-Lat and al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other?&lt;/em&gt;), then the devil threw (&lt;em&gt;alqa&lt;/em&gt;) upon his tongue: “Those are the elevated cranes: truly their intercession is dearly hoped!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon that the pagans said to Muhammad that he never before praised their idols. The Prophet prostrated and the pagans too prostrated along with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, Jibrael came and asked Muhammad to recite that which he earlier brought to him. When Muhammad recited the satanic verse, then Jibrael told him that he didn't bring that verse to him, but it was from the Satan. Thus, Allah revealed at that time: (Quran 22:52: And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except when he &quot;&lt;strong&gt;desires'' (Arabic: Tammana تمنی)&lt;/strong&gt;, the devil threw in his desire, so God erases what the devil throws in ...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to read all 50 traditions, then please buy the book of Mr. Shahab Ahmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId879075&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Criticism:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident occurred five years after Muhammad had received prophethood. It raises the question of why Muhammad, after five years, did not possess knowledge about whether the pagan gods were false or true deities of high status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Meccans (Quraysh) noticed this apparent &quot;contradiction&quot; in the revelations and began mocking Muhammad for it. It seems perplexing that Muhammad himself did not recognize the contradiction and immediately refute the so-called Satanic Verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, during the revelation of the verses, how was Satan able to influence Muhammad in the presence of Gabriel? Why didn't Gabriel intervene to prevent Satan's influence? According to Islam, only humans cannot see Satan, but angels are not oblivious to the devil's presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we assume that Gabriel was unable to see Satan, he could still hear what Muhammad was reciting to the gathering of pagans. Why didn't Gabriel warn Muhammad on the spot and prevent him from making such a grave mistake? Gabriel should have alerted Muhammad and rectified the situation before allowing him to leave the gathering of the Quraysh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's even more perplexing is that when Gabriel later visited Muhammad, Gabriel seemed unaware that Satan had misled Muhammad in reciting the Satanic Verses or of what transpired during that gathering. Gabriel only became aware of the incident after instructing Muhammad to revise the verses that he brought to him earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the entire incident, Allah did not intervene and allowed Muhammad to praise the pagan gods. However, in the evening, Allah suddenly became active and immediately revealed the verses of Surah Hajj, comforting Muhammad by stating that all previous prophets had also been misguided by Satan due to their desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why would Allah allow Satan to misguide His messengers? Allah offers the excuse that it was a &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot; However, the question arises: a test for whom? If Muhammad himself was led astray, failed the test, and started believing that the pagan gods held high status, then how could anyone else have a chance to pass this so-called &quot;test&quot;? Therefore, all those present, including Muhammad, prostrated to the pagan gods, and even the Muslims failed to recognize and denounce the Satanic Verses. They all failed the test unanimously. Hence, even if we assume the existence of Allah, the question arises about the &quot;wisdom&quot; of Allah. Why would He conduct a test with a guaranteed 0% success rate when His own prophet fell victim to Satan's influence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Subsequently, Allah busied Himself with removing the contamination of the Satanic Verses from the Quran. And after deleting the Satanic Verses from the Quran, Allah boasts about himself that people should look at His power and that He has the ability to clean the filth. So, people should believe in Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recurring use of the excuse of a &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; in the Quran is peculiar. Whenever the writer of the Quran faced unanswered questions, he resorted to this same excuse. For instance, when the Jews rejected Muhammad as a prophet of God, he became angry, and the writer of the Quran ordered a change in the Qibla direction (from Jerusalem to Mecca). When objections arose, the writer of the Quran once again invoked the excuse of a &quot;test&quot; to determine who would stand firm with Muhammad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&amp;amp;verse=143&quot;&gt;Quran 2:143&lt;/a&gt;). Even more perplexing is that not a single person, whether Muslim or hypocrite, abandoned Muhammad due to the change in Qibla. In this case, the success rate was 100%, with everyone passing the test, including the hypocrites. So, what was the purpose of such a test if everyone, including the hypocrites, would pass it? The reality is that this &quot;test&quot; is a feeble excuse, and the real reason for the change in Qibla was animosity towards the Jews. Please read all details here about this TEST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId970080&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamic Aqeedah (Belief): Even a 'donkey' is able to see Satan, but Prophet and Gabriel could not&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam asserts that even a humble creature like a donkey possesses the ability to perceive Satan's presence and alert others to it. However, it appears contradictory that Prophet Muhammad and Gabriel, who hold significant spiritual stature, were unable to see Satan. Consequently, Satan exerted dominance over both Muhammad and Gabriel, influencing the revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Beginning of Creation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/111&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet said, 'When you hear the crowing of cocks, ask for Allah's Blessings for (their crowing indicates that) they have seen an angel. And when you hear the braying of donkeys, seek Refuge with Allah from Satan for (their braying indicates) that they have seen a Satan.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another instance, the Prophet Muhammad expresses his strength by recounting an encounter in which he not only perceived Satan but also metaphorically symbolizes overpowering him, almost strangling him to the point of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Beginning of Creation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/21/14&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, 'Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Muhammad has a such high status that even a dream of a normal person becomes immune to Satan while the prophet Muhammad is present in his dream, but on the other hand, Muhammad was himself not immune to misguidance from Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Interpretations of Dreams (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/91/13&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet said, 'Whoever has seen me in a dream, then no doubt, he has seen me, for Satan cannot imitate my shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Muhammad holds such a high status that even the dreams of ordinary individuals become protected from Satan's influence when the Prophet Muhammad is present in those dreams. However, on the other hand, Muhammad himself was not immune to the potential misguidance from Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, book of creation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/96&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Sham (and asked. 'Who is here?'), The people said, 'Abu Ad-Darda.' Abu Darda said, 'Is the person whom Allah has protected against Satan, (as Allah's Messenger said) amongst you'. The sub narrator, Mughira said that the person who was given Allah's Refuge through the tongue of the Prophet was `Ammar (bin Yasir).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the 'contradictions' in the so-called divine revelations, which will ultimately lead to only one conclusion that it was Muhammad who was himself making those revelations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, the late Mr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahab_Ahmed&quot; hreflang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Shahab Ahmed&lt;/a&gt; wrote an amazing book '&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Before-Orthodoxy-Satanic-Verses-Early-ebook/dp/B0747JQKKV/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QL2JE8QNYVFN&amp;amp;keywords=Before+Orthodoxy%3A+The+Satanic+Verses+in+Early+Islam&amp;amp;qid=1660673380&amp;amp;sprefix=before+orthodoxy+the+satanic+verses+in+early+islam%2Caps%2C437&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before Orthodoxy: The Satanic Verses in Early Islam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;', in which he collected 50 traditions from many Sahaba (i.e. the 1st generation of Muslims) and tābi‘īn اَلتَّابِعِينَ (i.e. 2nd generation of Muslims) about the incident of Satanic Verses.

&lt;p&gt;Muslims underwent three stages regarding the incident of the Satanic Verses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Period&lt;/strong&gt;: During the initial 200 years, all Muslims universally accepted the incident of the Satanic Verses based on the teachings of the Quran and Traditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Period&lt;/strong&gt;: Following that, there was a period where some Muslims accepted the incident while others rejected it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Period&lt;/strong&gt;: In the last 200 years, the majority of Muslims almost universally deny that the incident of the Satanic Verses ever occurred, also based on the teachings of the same Quran and Traditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did the perception of the Satanic Verses incident shift from being considered 100% true to being viewed as 100% false? What caused this transformation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem arose when the &quot;contradictions&quot; in the &quot;divine revelation&quot; were exposed during the incident of the Satanic Verses. Despite presenting various excuses, Muslims were unable to conceal the human errors in those instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another contributing factor was the emergence of the doctrine within the Muslim community that &quot;Prophets are protected from being misguided by Satan.&quot; Mr. Shahab Ahmed clearly expressed this doctrine in the following words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the doctrines that emerged from the mid-2nd/8th century onwards was that of `ismat al-anbiya', literally the protection of the Prophets', meaning God's Protection of them from sin and error. The idea of the `ismah of the Prophets, which seems to have originated among the Shiah, was embraced as a doctrinal principle in some form or another by almost every Muslim sect and theological or legal school. With the spread of the concept that Muhammad constituted the model personality whose normative conduct (sunnah), as recorded in the klactith, was to be imitated by every Muslim, the idea that he should not sin must have appeared both logical and persuasive. Also, with the establishment of the legal principle that the Muslim community itself was protected from agreement upon error in the interpretation of Di-vine Law, it was hardly possible for the exemplar of the Law to be allowed to err himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;: Ahmed, Shahab. “Ibn Taymiyyah and the Satanic Verses.” &lt;em&gt;Studia Islamica&lt;/em&gt;, no. 87, 1998, pp. 67–124. &lt;em&gt;JSTOR&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1595926&quot;&gt; www.jstor.org/stable/1595926&lt;/a&gt;. Accessed 8 June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, subsequent generations of Muslims were compelled to outright deny this incident in order to defend the honor of Islam. Consequently, they resorted to fabricating falsehoods and feeble excuses as a means to disavow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the predicament with fabrications is that they often contradict one another, necessitating the invention of numerous additional lies to conceal a single falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same predicament befell the later generations of Muslims. Initially, they became divided into two groups, each refuting the other based on the teachings of the same Quran and Traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group of Muslims outright denied the occurrence of this incident, asserting that there are no Quranic verses related to it, and all the traditions pertaining to this incident are weak. Therefore, they concluded that the incident never actually took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the second group of Muslims accepted the occurrence of the incident but sought to preserve the honor of Islam through the employment of 'Taweel' (figurative interpretation in Arabic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group found themselves compelled to refute the first group since this incident is indeed mentioned in the Quran itself and is supported by 'authentic' traditions transmitted through different chains of narration. Thus, denying its existence altogether became an untenable position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId492278&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What led the Salaf, the early Muslim generations of the first 200 years, to unanimously assert that the Quran itself serves as evidence for the occurrence of the incident of the Satanic Verses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, despite being an extremist Muslim and an apologist for Islam, wrote about this incident (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007100348/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?ID=611&amp;amp;start=&amp;amp;idfrom=1015&amp;amp;idto=1019&amp;amp;bookid=22&amp;amp;Hashiya=5&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;والمأثور عن السلف &lt;strong&gt;يوافق القرآن بذلك&lt;/strong&gt; ... وأما الذين قرروا ما نقل عن السلف فقالوا هذا منقول نقلا ثابتا لا يمكن القدح فيه&lt;strong&gt; والقرآن يدل عليه&lt;/strong&gt; بقوله ۔۔۔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what has been transmitted from the early generations of Salaf (i.e. this incident is authentic) &lt;strong&gt;aligns with the Quran in this matter&lt;/strong&gt;... As for those who have affirmed what has been transmitted from the early generations, they have stated that it is a confirmed transmission that cannot be criticized, and the Quran proves it through its verses too...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the question is, why did the Salaf (early Muslims of the first 200 years) unanimously assert that the Quran itself serves as evidence for the occurrence of this incident? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is, the presence of the words &lt;strong&gt;DESIRE&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;INTERCESSION&lt;/strong&gt; in these verses of Surah an-Najam make it impossible to deny this incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us look at Suran an-Najm, Verse 53:19-26, once again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Verse 24) Or shall man have whatever he &lt;strong&gt;'desires' (Arabic:&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=mny#%2822:52:11%29&quot;&gt; tamannā&lt;/a&gt; تمنی) &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;(Verse 25) To God belong the Last and the First.&lt;br&gt;(Verse 26) How many an angel is there in the heavens whose &lt;strong&gt;intercession&lt;/strong&gt; avails nothing, except after God gives permission to whomever He wills, and approves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already discussed above, how these verses become totally out of context with the proceeding and preceding verses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we interpret them within the context of the abrogated and deleted Satanic Verses and the entire incident surrounding them (where Muhammad &quot;&lt;strong&gt;desired&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; reconciliation with the Meccans and accepted the &quot;intercession&quot; of pagan goddesses), then these 2 verses of Surah an-Najm immediately assumes a logical and meaningful position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why Salaf Muslims of the first 200 years unanimously accepted the incident of Satanic Verses, while the Quran is itself a witness upon it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId315979&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Even Sahih (authentic) Traditions also prove the occurrence of this incident&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani is considered to be one of the highest authorities upon Hadith by Muslims. He refuted the first group and wrote in his book “Fath-ul-Bari” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وكلها سوى طريق سعيد بن جبير إما ضعيف وإلا منقطع ، لكن كثرة الطرق تدل على أن للقصة أصلا ، مع أن لها طريقين آخرين مرسلين رجالهما على شرط الصحيحين أحدهما ما أخرجه الطبري من طريق يونس بن يزيد عن ابن شهاب حدثني أبو بكر بن عبد الرحمن بن الحارث بن هشام فذكر نحوه، والثاني ما أخرجه أيضا من طريق المعتمر بن سليمان وحماد بن سلمة فرقهما عن داود بن أبي هند عن أبي العالية ۔۔۔ ثم نقل تضعيف ابن العربي والقاضي عياض القصة ثم قال - : ۔۔۔ فإن الطرق إذا كثرت وتباينت مخارجها دل ذلك على أن لها أصلا ، وقد ذكرت أن ثلاثة أسانيد منها على شرط الصحيح ، وهي مراسيل يَحتجُّ بمثلها مَن يحتجُّ بالمرسل ، وكذا من لا يحتج به ، لاعتضاد بعضها ببعض ۔۔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the paths of this hadith are either weak or cut off, except for that of Sa`id ibn Jubayr… However, the profusion of the chains show that the story has a basis, furthermore, there are two other “mursal” chains whose narrators are those of Bukhari and Muslim. The first one is that narrated by al-Tabari through Yunus ibn Yazid from Ibn Shihab [al-Zuhri]: “Abu Bakr ibn `Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham narrated to me,” etc. The second is what al-Tabari also narrated through al-Mu`tamir ibn Sulayman and Hammad ibn Salama from Dawud ibn Abi Hind from Abu al-`Aliya…. Contrary to what Abu Bakr ibn al-`Arabi and al-Qadi `Iyad have claimed whereby the story has no basis at all…. When the paths of a hadith are many and distinct, it shows that the report has a basis…. So, as I said, there are three sound but ‘&lt;em&gt;mursal&lt;/em&gt;‘ chains for it, among them what meets the criteria of the two Sahihs but for the fact that they are ‘&lt;em&gt;mursal&lt;/em&gt;‘. These constitute proof for both those that accept ‘mursal’ reports as proofs and those that do not, due to the mutual strengthening of the chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence from the Quran itself is so explicit that there is no need for additional traditions to confirm the occurrence of the Satanic Verses incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shed light on the tactics and deceptions employed by some Muslims in the name of &quot;Ilm-ul-Hadith&quot; (Science of Hadith), we have provided a list of 50 Hadiths pertaining to this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Sahih Bukhari briefly mentions this incident twice, offering shorter versions that still substantiate its occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From companion Ibn Abbas in Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;http://qaalarasulallah.com/hadithView.php?ID=1041&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Ibn `Abbas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet prostrated while reciting An-Najm and with him prostrated the Muslims, the pagans, the jinns, and all human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from companion 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud in Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211103073838/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1070&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet recited Surat an-Najm (103) at Mecca and prostrated while reciting it and those who were with him did the same except an old man who took a handful of small stones or earth and lifted it to his forehead and said, 'This is sufficient for me.' Later on, I saw him killed as a non-believer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists, in their attempt to refute the existence of the Satanic Verses incident, argued that these two traditions do not explicitly mention the Satanic Verses. However, this raises the question of why the pagans would prostrate alongside Muhammad and the Muslims if such an incident did not occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, Islamic apologists put forward the following excuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was the &lt;strong&gt;beauty&lt;/strong&gt; of the Quran which made Pagans automatically fall down and to prostrate to Allah when they heard this verse: (&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=53&amp;amp;verse=62&quot;&gt;Suran an-Najm 53:62:&lt;/a&gt; So prostrate to Allah and worship Him).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a flaw in this argument put forth by Islamic apologists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nowhere in these two traditions of Sahih Bukhari is it mentioned that the pagans prostrated due to any perceived &quot;beauty&quot; of the Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quran mentioned prostration to Allah in several places in the Quran, but pagans never prostrated upon them.  Does this imply that the remaining verses of the Quran lack any beauty that the pagans didn't prostrate there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, the preceding verses of the verse of prostration in Surah An-Najm (53:62) actually present a contrasting narrative, i.e. (1) The pagans of Mecca were mocking the Quran, (2) They were playing around with the Quran, and (3) To them, the Quran was not beautiful at all, but rather filled with falsehoods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could then the pagans prostrate with Muhammad and other Muslims after hearing it? Just read these verses yourself which are witness of mocking of the Quran by pagans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=53&amp;amp;verse=59&quot;&gt;Suran an-Najm, verses 59 to 62&lt;/a&gt;) Do you then wonder at this recital (the Quran)? And you laugh at it and weep not, while ye amuse yourselves (while playing games with it)? So, prostrate to Allah and worship [Him].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the preceding verses of the Quran contradict the arguments put forth by Islamic apologists, and it becomes clear that if the pagans prostrated alongside Muhammad, it was undoubtedly due to the occurrence of the Satanic Verses incident. This indicates that Muhammad did indeed praise their goddesses, leading the Meccan pagans to also prostrate alongside him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId860971&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The second group attempted to alter the interpretation of the incident of the Satanic Verses by employing various &quot;Taweels&quot; (i.e., figurative interpretations)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group of Muslims acknowledged the occurrence of the incident of the Satanic Verses based on Quranic verses and numerous traditions. However, they attempted to dismiss it by resorting to &quot;Taweel&quot; (تأويل), which is a figurative interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, Taweel is nothing more than a feeble excuse that lacks substantiation and is merely based on conjecture. Furthermore, Taweel is not aligned with the principles of justice; rather, it is a means of deceiving and undermining justice. Unfortunately, many Muslims still rely on Taweel to protect the reputation of their religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani belonged to this second group and documented the various Taweels concocted by Muslims to defend the honour of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, Ibn Hajar accepted this incident based on multiple traditions. He writes (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the paths of this hadith are either weak or cut off, except for that of Sa`id ibn Jubayr… However, the profusion of the chains show that the story has a basis, furthermore, there are two other “mursal” chains whose narrators are those of Bukhari and Muslim. The first one is that narrated by al-Tabari through Yunus ibn Yazid from Ibn Shihab [al-Zuhri]: “Abu Bakr ibn `Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham narrated to me,” etc. The second is what al-Tabari also narrated through al-Mu`tamir ibn Sulayman and Hammad ibn Salama from Dawud ibn Abi Hind from Abu al-`Aliya…. Contrary to what Abu Bakr ibn al-`Arabi and al-Qadi `Iyad have claimed that this story of Satanic Verses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; has no basis at all…. When the paths of a hadith are many and distinct, it shows that the report has a basis…. So, as I said, there are three sound but ‘&lt;em&gt;mursal&lt;/em&gt;‘ chains for it, among them what meets the criteria of the two Sahihs but for the fact that they are ‘&lt;em&gt;mursal&lt;/em&gt;‘. These constitute proof for both those that accept ‘mursal’ reports as proofs and those that do not, due to the mutual strengthening of the chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar argued the necessity of presenting Taweel, in order to save the honour of Islam. He continues (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وإذا تقرر ذلك تعين تأويل ما وقع فيها مما يستنكر وهو قوله : &quot; ألقى الشيطان على لسانه : تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى &quot; فإن ذلك لا يجوز حمله على ظاهره لأنه يستحيل عليه - صلى الله عليه وسلم - أن يزيد في القرآن عمدا ما ليس منه ، وكذا سهوا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This said, it is required to interpret the incident (i.e. to do TAWEEL) and address what appears to be reprehensible, namely the statement 'the devil interjected the Satanic Verses upon the Prophet's tongue (i.e. &quot;Those pagan goddesses are the elevated cranes: truly their intercession is dearly hoped). Such a thing is precluded from being accepted in literal terms for it is impossible for the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - to add something to the Qur'an that does not belong to it whether deliberately (`amdan) &lt;strong&gt;or erroneously (sahwan)&lt;/strong&gt;. ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disagree with Ibn Hajar's reasoning. &quot;Justice&quot; entails accepting facts and evidence as they are, without altering them for the sake of preserving the honour of religion and the Prophet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This so-called Taweel (i.e., figurative interpretation) is essentially an act that undermines justice by relying on conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId123582&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The First Taweel: Prophet praised pagan gods in those 2 Verses only in order to ridicule them&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar presented the first Taweel that the Prophet actually uttered the praise of pagan goddesses in order to ridicule them (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وقد رد ذلك عياض فأجاد . وقيل لعله قالها توبيخا للكفار ، قال عياض . وهذا جائز إذا كانت هناك قرينة تدل على المراد . ولا سيما وقد كان الكلام في ذلك الوقت في الصلاة جائزا - وإلى هذا نحا الباقلاني . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Qadi `Iyad did well when he said: 'It is possible the Prophet - Allah bless and greet him - was mentioning the belief of the pagans &lt;strong&gt;by way of derision&lt;/strong&gt;, noting that at that time it was permitted to speak in the midst of prayer. To this position leaned Ibn al-Baqillani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conjecture has no weight if it were a mockery of the pagan gods, the pagans would not have prostrated along with Muhammad and other Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId717388&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Second Taweel: It was not the Prophet, but Pagans themselves uttered those 2 Verses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar presented the second Taweel that it was not the prophet, but the Pagans themselves, who uttered those 2 Satanic Verses. He wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقيل إنه لما وصل إلى قوله : &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515#docu&quot;&gt;ومناة الثالثة الأخرى &lt;/a&gt;خشي المشركون أن يأتي بعدها بشيء يذم آلهتهم به فبادروا إلى ذلك الكلام فخلطوه في تلاوة النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - على عادتهم في قولهم . &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515#docu&quot;&gt;لا تسمعوا لهذا القرآن والغوا فيه &lt;/a&gt;ونسب ذلك للشيطان لكونه الحامل لهم على ذلك ، أو المراد بالشيطان شيطان الإنس&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also said that when he reached the words {Have ye thought upon Al Lat and Al Uzza? And Manat, the third, the other?} the pagans feared lest he would add something to mock their gods, so they hastened to interject and jeer so as to cover up what was coming next, as was their habit stated in the verse { And those who disbelieve say: 'Listen not to this Quran, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome.'} (41:26). This act on their part was attributed to the devil as it was he that inspired it to them. Or, what was meant by the devil was the devil of humankind (i.e. it were Pagans themselves who uttered those Satanic Verses)....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, it is evident that this figurative interpretation (Taweel) is solely based on conjecture, contradicting both the Quran and the 50 traditions that discuss this incident. The Quran does not mention any noise made by the pagans, but rather emphasizes the &quot;desire&quot; of the Prophet and Satan's influence in inserting the Satanic verses into his desire. Subsequently, Allah expresses anger towards the Prophet, threatens him with double punishment, and ultimately abrogates those verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId110935&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Third Taweel: The Prophet was neither misled by Satan nor he uttered those 2 Verses, but it was Satan who directly spoke those 2 verses in the voice of the prophet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar presented the third Taweel, that it was Satan who spoke those Satanic Verses in the voice of the Prophet (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقيل : كان النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - يرتل القرآن فارتصده الشيطان في سكتة من السكتات ونطق بتلك الكلمات محاكيا نغمته بحيث سمعه من دنا إليه فظنها من قوله وأشاعها . قال : وهذا أحسن الوجوه&lt;strong&gt; .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was reciting the Quran with measured recitation. During one of the pauses, Satan seized the opportunity and uttered those words, imitating the Prophet's tone in such a way that those who were nearby heard it and thought it was from the Prophet. They then spread it as if it were his words. This, it is said, is the best of the interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, how can this conjecture be accepted when the Quran is so clear that indeed Muhammad was mislead due to this DESIRE? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId939635&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fourth Taweel: The meaning of 'Tamana تمني' in this verse is not '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/span&gt;', but it means '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;RECITATION&lt;/span&gt;'&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ibn Hajar mentioned another excuse that the meaning of 'Tamana تمني' does not only '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to desire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;', but it also has another meaning of '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to recite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;' (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151007102529/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=8577&amp;amp;idto=8578&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2515&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قال : ومعنى قوله : في أمنيته أي في تلاوته ، فأخبر تعالى في هذه الآية أن سنته في رسله إذا قالوا قولا زاد الشيطان فيه من قبل نفسه ، فهذا نص في أن الشيطان زاده في قول النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - لا أن النبي - صلى الله عليه وسلم - قاله قال : وقد سبق إلى ذلك الطبري لجلالة قدره وسعة علمه وشدة ساعده في النظر فصوب على هذا المعنى وحوم عليه .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The meaning of 'omniyyatihi' in verse 52 (of Surah al-Hajj) is '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;recitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'. Allah Almighty therefore informed us in this verse that His establish practice with His messengers is that if they (i.e. messengers) recite something, Satan adds to it this recitation from himself. This is a clear proof that Satan added something to what the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, not that the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself said it (due to his desire).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Our Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists soon realised that till the time the word 'Desire تمني' (i.e. the prophet got mislead due to his desire) is present in the Quran, they have no chance to defend the prophet by making any excuse/conjecture/Taweel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the next step, they altogether changed the meaning of 'Tamana تمني' from '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(28, 0, 254);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;' to '&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this change, their modified translation is as following:&lt;/p&gt;

[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/22/52/default.htm&quot;&gt;Link to many of these modified translations&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The word تَمَنَّىٰ is a verb, while أُمْنِيَّتِهِ is a noun, and both mean 'to desire'. However, Islamic apologists changed both to 'to recite'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Readers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The correct translation of the word 'تمني' is indeed &quot;desire&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the translation of &quot;&lt;strong&gt;recitation&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is indeed false and it was fabricated by some later Muslim scholars to defend the incident of Satanic Verses. It is indeed shameful that many Muslim Scholars propagated this falsehood, which goes against honesty. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof 1: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even many Muslim Translators didn't accept this falsehood and translated it correctly (i.e. they used the word 'desire' instead of 'recitation'). We invite people to go this &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof 2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed earlier, both these verses in Surah an-Najm and Surah al-Hajj pertain to the same incident of Satanic Verses. In verse 24 of Surah an-Najm, the meaning of 'Tamana تمني' clearly indicates 'desire'. Therefore, it is logical to interpret the usage of 'Tamana تمني' in verse 52 of Surah al-Hajj in the same context of 'desire'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Surah al-Najm, Verse 24) Or shall man have whatever he '&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;' (Arabic:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; tamannā&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; تمنی)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof 3&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 50 traditions about the incident of Satanic Verses are unanimously telling that the prophet indeed got mislead due to his 'desire'. How can you neglect all these traditions, and then change the meaning of (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tamannā&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; تمنی) only based upon your conjecture? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof 4&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence in the whole Arabic literature (pre-Islamic, in the Quran &amp;amp; Hadith, and even after Islam) that the term 'Tamana تمني' also means 'recitation'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is only a &lt;strong&gt;SINGLE&lt;/strong&gt; instance in the &lt;strong&gt;whole&lt;/strong&gt; history of Arabic Literature, where it has been claimed that it could also mean &quot;recitation&quot;. It was a poem attributed to Hassan Ibn Thabit where the word 'Tamana تمني' is claimed to be used to mean recitation. However, even this single occasion is also DOUBTFUL as this narration is weak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim Scholar Ibn Aashoor writes in his book &quot;al-Tahrir wa al-Tanwir&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/22/53&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

  &quot; href=&quot;https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/22/53&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;التحرير والتنوير — ابن عاشور (١٣٩٣ هـ)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وقَدْ فَسَّرَ كَثِيرٌ مِنَ المُفَسِّرِينَ (تَمَنّى) بِمَعْنى قَرَأ. وتَبِعَهم أصْحابُ كُتُبِ اللُّغَةِ وذَكَرُوا بَيْتًا نَسَبُوهُ إلى &lt;strong&gt;حَسّانَ بْنِ ثابِتٍ وذَكَرُوا قِصَّةً بِرِواياتٍ ضَعِيفَةٍ سَنَذْكُرُها ...&lt;/strong&gt; وعِنْدِي في صِحَّةِ إطْلاقِ لَفْظِ الأُمْنِيَّةِ عَلى القِراءَةِ شَكٌّ عَظِيمٌ، فَإنَّهُ وإنْ كانَ قَدْ ورَدَ تَمَنّى بِمَعْنى قَرَأ في بَيْتٍ &lt;strong&gt;نُسِبَ إلى حَسّانَ بْنِ ثابِتٍ إنْ صَحَّتْ رِوايَةُ البَيْتِ عَنْ حَسّانَ &lt;/strong&gt;... &lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;فَلا أظُنُّ أنَّ القِراءَةَ يُقالُ لَها أُمْنِيَّةٌ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many interpreters have explained 'tamanā' (تَمَنَّى) as meaning 'read.' This interpretation is followed by scholars of the Arabic language, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;who have cited a poem attributed to Hassan ibn Thabit and mentioned a story &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0); text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;with weak chains of narration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that we will discuss ... &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personally, I have significant doubts about the accuracy of using the term 'amnīyah' (أُمْنِيَّة) to refer to 'recitation,'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; despite the fact that the term 'tamanā' has been used in a verse attributed to Hassan ibn Thabit ... &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do not believe that 'recitation' should be referred to as 'amnīyah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Ibn Aashoor furhter wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tafsir.app/ibn-aashoor/22/53&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عَمُوا أنَّ (تَمَنّى) بِمَعْنى: قَرَأ، والأُمْنِيَّةُ: القِراءَةُ، وهو ادِّعاءٌ لا يُوثَقُ بِهِ ولا يُوجَدُ لَهُ شاهِدٌ صَرِيحٌ في كَلامِ العَرَبِ. وأنْشَدُوا بَيْتًا لِحَسّانَ بْنِ ثابِتٍ في رِثاءِ عُثْمانَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;poetry&quot;&gt;تَمَنّى كِتابَ اللَّهِ أوَّلَ لَيْلِهِ ∗∗∗ وآخِرَهُ لاقى حِمامَ المَقادِرِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وهُوَ مُحْتَمَلٌ أنَّ مَعْناهُ تَمَنّى أنْ يَقْرَأ القُرْآنَ في أوَّلِ اللَّيْلِ عَلى عادَتِهِ فَلَمْ يَتَمَكَّنْ مِن ذَلِكَ بِتَشْغِيبِ أهْلِ الحِصارِ عَلَيْهِ وقَتَلُوهُ آخِرَ اللَّيْلِ. ولِهَذا جَعَلَهُ تَمَنِّيًا لِأنَّهُ أحَبَّ ذَلِكَ فَلَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have claimed that 'tamanā' (تَمَنَّى) means 'to read,' and that 'amnīyah' (الأُمْنِيَّة) refers to 'recitation,' &lt;strong&gt;but this assertion is not reliable and lacks clear evidence in Arabic language usage&lt;/strong&gt;. They have cited a verse attributed to Hassan ibn Thabit in praise of Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;تَمَنّى كِتابَ اللَّهِ أوَّلَ لَيْلِهِ ∗∗∗ وآخِرَهُ لاقى حِمامَ المَقادِرِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this verse might also imply that he &lt;strong&gt;wished&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to read&lt;/strong&gt; the Quran at the beginning of the night according to his practice, but was unable to do so due to the disturbance from the besiegers who killed him at the end of the night. Therefore, his &lt;strong&gt;wish&lt;/strong&gt; was considered unfulfilled because he loved it but could not achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see the double standards of Islamic apologists? They rejected the whole Arabic literature, which unanimously used 'tamanā' (تَمَنَّى) as 'desire'. Instead, they went without any proof for a 'singular' and a weak source, which claims that 'Tamana تمني' means 'recitation'. This is indeed dishonesty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId965765&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Excuse by Modern Islamic apologists: Surah al-Hajj was revealed 8 years after Surah an-Najm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Islamic apologists also deny the existence of the incident of Satanic Verses on the basis of this argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surah al-Hajj was revealed 8 years after Surah an-Najm. How is it possible to accept that Allah will reveal verses about one incident 8 years after it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument holds no weight as it is widely known that the Quran is not arranged in chronological order. Each surah contains verses from various incidents that occurred at different times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Quran is characterized by its lack of coherence to such an extent that within a single verse, one part may refer to one incident while the second part addresses a completely different incident that took place years apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/5.3&quot;&gt;Quran 5:3)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةُ وَٱلدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ ٱلْخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِۦ وَٱلْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَٱلْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَٱلْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَٱلنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ ٱلسَّبُعُ إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى ٱلنُّصُبِ وَأَن تَسْتَقْسِمُوا۟ بِٱلْأَزْلَٰمِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ ۗ ٱلْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِن دِينِكُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَٱخْشَوْنِ ۚ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِى وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلْإِسْلَٰمَ دِينًا ۚ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ فِى مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لِّإِثْمٍ ۙ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1st part of the verse):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, and the strangled (animal) and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2nd part of the verse):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3rd part of the verse):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the consensus of Quran commentators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first segment of this verse pertains to the prohibition of certain foods, and it was revealed during the sixth year of the Hijri calendar, specifically during the time of the Hudaybiyyah Pact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the second (middle) segment of this verse abruptly shifts its focus to the &quot;Perfection of Religion,&quot; and this portion was revealed at a completely different time during the tenth year of the Hijri calendar. It is unrelated to the preceding segment of the verse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third and final segment of the verse returns to the initial incident regarding the prohibited foods, which was revealed during the Hudaybiyyah Pact in the sixth year of the Hijri calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his Quranic commentary, Maulana Modoodi stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;According to authentic traditions, the second segment of the verse, which addresses the perfection of religion, was revealed during the 'Last Sermon' in the tenth year of the Hijri calendar. However, the initial segment of the verse pertains to the Hudaybiyyah Pact (which occurred in the sixth year of the Hijri calendar).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId575198&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The initial verses of Surah an-Najm became a significant factor that later compelled Muslims to completely deny the incident of Satanic Verses.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Muhammad introduced his new religion and claimed to receive revelations from an Angel sent by God, the people of Mecca ridiculed him and accused him of being misled by Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counter this accusation, Muhammad recited Surah an-Najm in a gathering of Meccans, specifically the beginning verses of the Surah. In these verses, he vehemently denied being astray or misled, stating that his words were not driven by personal desire, but rather divine revelation taught to him by a mighty power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial verses of this Surah are as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/53.1?context=5&quot;&gt;Suran an-Najm, Verses 1 to 5&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the Star when it goes down,- Your Companion [Muhammad] is &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;neither astray nor being misled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire. It is naught but revelation that is revealed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which one of mighty powers has taught him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, within the same Surah, Muhammad later affirmed the charge of being misled by Satan, acknowledging that he indeed went astray and got mislead and had mistakenly praised the pagan gods under Satan's influence. This admission contradicted the initial verses of Surah an-Najm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proves human error in what was presented by Muhammad as divine revelation. It opens the door to questioning the existence of Allah in the heavens and considering that Muhammad could have been the sole originator of these revelations, vulnerable to making human mistakes in their transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no divine Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad had to create Islamic laws on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Muhammad was only a human and not well-educated, he made significant &quot;Mathematical Mistakes&quot; while distributing inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, your human intellect will clearly guide you to recognize that these Islamic rulings are ridiculous and lack wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, it is only women who have to suffer due to these absurd rulings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, let's consider a scenario where an individual passes away, leaving behind one daughter, parents, and wife. In such a case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The share of the daughter is 1/2 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“...and if there is only one daughter, then she shall have half the inheritance.” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.12&quot;&gt;4:12&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of shares in this case is calculated as follows: 1/2 for the daughter + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 0.96.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, if the deceased left behind $1000, according to the Qur'an, the judge would only need to distribute $960 among the heirs, leaving $40 remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted with this mathematical error, Muhammad found it impossible to rectify. As a solution, he advised them to allocate the remaining portion of the estate to the nearest &quot;male&quot; relative &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;(Source: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/23/2&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 1615a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;). This is known as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/133406/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AB&quot;&gt;'Asbah عصبة&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the remaining amount of $40 USD in this particular scenario may appear insignificant for the next male relative, little did Muhammad know that it would turn out to be a fatal mistake. This error resulted in Islamic rulings that are deemed ridiculous, illogical, and unjust towards women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to provide a few examples to demonstrate the unjust nature of these inheritance laws, and your human intellect will naturally recognize their lack of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous online Islamic inheritance calculators are available. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://inheritance.ilmsummit.org/&quot;&gt;Calculator 1&lt;/a&gt; (A simple Islamic inheritance calculator).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inheritance-calculator.com/&quot;&gt;Calculator 2&lt;/a&gt; (A detailed Islamic inheritance calculator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use any online calculator to verify the following examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Example: Old Widow will get 25%, while a “MALE” relative (even a distant one like a cousin, or his son, or his grandson) will get 75% &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case where the deceased has no children but only a wife and a distant male relative (such as a cousin, or his son, or his grandson), the distribution of shares would be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widow will receive 25% of the inheritance, while the &quot;male&quot; relative, regardless of their proximity, will receive the remaining 75%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;dgSharesIndiv&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 37.4326%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; rules=&quot;all&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2943%; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Share Percentage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50.374%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Wife&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.277%; background-color: #bfedd2; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1/4&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2943%; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;25%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50.374%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any distant male Relative like &lt;br&gt;Cousin (or even his descendants)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.277%; background-color: #bfedd2; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;3/4&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2943%; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;75%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a wife who remains with her husband throughout her life, it may seem unjust that when she becomes a widow in her old age, she is entitled to only 25% of the inheritance. Meanwhile, the remaining 75% of the inheritance is awarded to a distant male relative, such as a cousin or any of his descendants, whom the deceased person may have never even encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this arrangement appear sensible to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you discern any divine wisdom in this particular Islamic law?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you believe that justice has been served to women by Muhammad/Allah in this regard?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the opposite scenario does not hold true. If a woman passes away, her husband will inherit all her property, regardless of the presence of her closest relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Example: Mother will get 33.33%, while distant relatives (like cousins, or his son, or his grandson) will get 66.67%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the deceased person has an old mother and a distant male relative, the distribution of shares would be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;dgSharesIndiv&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 38.9892%; height: 136px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; rules=&quot;all&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2245%; height: 48px; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Share Percentage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 24px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50.4511%; height: 24px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Mother&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.2746%; height: 24px; background-color: #bfedd2; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1/3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2245%; height: 24px; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;33.33%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 64px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50.4511%; height: 64px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any distant male Relative like &lt;br&gt;Cousin (or even his descendants)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.2746%; height: 64px; background-color: #bfedd2; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;2/3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2245%; height: 64px; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;66.67%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in this case, the old mother will receive only 33.33% of the inheritance, while a cousin (or his descendants, whom the deceased person may not have even encountered in his entire life) will receive 66.67%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might question the rationale behind this distribution and whether any divine wisdom can be perceived in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd Example: Sister will get much more share in inheritance than the mother and the wife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the sister is married, she will still receive a larger share of the inheritance compared to the mother or the wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 30.3167%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8; width: 43.1484%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Share Percentage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.1419%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Mother&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #bfedd2; width: 34.9161%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;2/5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8; width: 43.1484%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.1419%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Sister&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #bfedd2; width: 34.9161%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;3/5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8; width: 43.1484%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;60%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the closer bond between a mother and her son, the illogical distribution of shares dictated by the Quran results in the sister receiving a larger inheritance portion than the mother (even if the sister is married).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the widow's share is even smaller than that of the mother, while the sister's share becomes even more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 30.6132%; height: 72px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even if a deceased person has a daughter, still half of the property will go to the sister (even if she is married). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 30.6132%; height: 72px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;width: 41.9894%; height: 24px; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;width: 24.2129%; height: 24px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Sister&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These inequitable and absurd divisions are a result of the illogical Islamic laws of inheritance, which lack any divine wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId375244&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(2) When SHARES make MORE than the Estate (An &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance&quot;&gt;'Awl عول&lt;/a&gt; Case)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the case where an individual passes away, leaving behind three daughters, parents, and wife, the distribution of inheritance would be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The share of the three daughters is 2/3 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“...If (the heirs of the deceased are) more than two daughters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.12&quot;&gt;4:12&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of shares in this scenario is calculated as 2/3 for the daughters + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 1.125.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if the deceased left behind 1000 dinars, according to the Quran, the judge would require 1125 dinars to distribute among the heirs, which exceeds the available amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad passed away without providing any solution to rectify this mathematical mistake in the Quran or Hadith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, a similar case was presented to 'Umar Ibn Khattab, and he also found himself at a loss regarding what to do. However, someone suggested that he proportionally reduce the share of all heirs, and 'Umar adopted this &quot;self-made&quot; solution in an attempt to address the mathematical error in the Quran &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Ibn Abbas disagreed with 'Umar's approach, and Shia Muslims also have a differing perspective. They proposed an alternative &quot;self-fabricated&quot; solution (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bzu.edu.pk/PJIR/vol10/eng%206%20Shahbaz%20Cheema%2004-11-13.pdf#page=9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;In Islam, the Creator of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2017-01-universe-trillion-galaxies.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Two Trillion Galaxies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt; can’t add fractions, and thus Islamic Sharia has one Quranic Mathematical Error and 2 self-fabricated solutions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId111853&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(3) Linguistic Mistake in the Quran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If (the heirs of the deceased are) &lt;strong&gt;more than two daughters&lt;/strong&gt;, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah is incorrectly using the phrase “&lt;strong&gt;more than two daughters&lt;/strong&gt;” when He actually wanted to say “&lt;strong&gt;two or more daughters&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a clear linguistic mistake, and it happened while no Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Muslim Scholars agree that two daughters will get 2/3 of the estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad himself distributed 2/3rd of the estate between two daughters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi, 2092:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The wife of Sa’d bin Rabi’ came with the two daughters of Sa’d to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, these are the two daughters of Sa’d. He was killed with you on the day of Uhud, and their paternal uncle has taken all that their father left behind, and a woman is only married for her wealth.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent until the Verse of inheritance was revealed to him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the brother of Sa’d bin Rabi’ and said: ‘Give the two daughters of Sa’d two thirds of his wealth, and give his wife on eighth, and take what is left.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId964022&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tehrif (Distortion) Case:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of this error was significant enough that modern Muslim Quran translators had to resort to distorting the translation by changing it to &quot;two or more daughters.&quot; This can be observed in translations such as Yousuf Ali's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm&quot;&gt;Quran 4:11&lt;/a&gt;) Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, &lt;strong&gt;two or more&lt;/strong&gt;, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm&quot;&gt;Yusuf Ali, Saudi Revised Edition,1985&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there are other modern Quran translators who have also adopted this distorted translation of &quot;two or more daughters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to these modern translators, there are other translators who have chosen not to make any distortion in the translation and have accurately translated it as &quot;more than two daughters.&quot; Some of these translators include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is regrettable that certain modern Islamic apologists have deemed dishonesty permissible for themselves. They engage in distortions, concealment, and outright lies. However, the truth has a way of revealing itself despite their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page-header&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId307784&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(4) Kalalah كلالة: Contradictions in the Quran &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;icons&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;float-end&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kalālah (Arabic: كلالة) is an Islamic inheritance term used to describe a deceased person who has an estate but lacks direct ascendants or descendants (meaning they have neither parents nor children).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad himself), initially revealed the rulings on inheritance during the third year of the Hijri calendar after the battle of Uhud, which resulted in the death of 70 Muslims and the subsequent need to divide their inheritance. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (Please see the introduction of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=4&amp;amp;verse=1&quot;&gt;Surah al-Nisa by Maududi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;com-content-article__body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that period in the third year of the Hijri calendar, the Quran prescribed the division of inheritance for a Kalalah individual (someone who has neither parents nor children) in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suran al-Nisa &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.12&quot;&gt;4:12&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;۔۔۔ وَإِن كَانَ رَجُلٌ يُورَثُ &lt;strong&gt;كَلاَلَةً&lt;/strong&gt; أَوِ امْرَأَةٌ وَلَهُ أَخٌ أَوْ أُخْتٌ فَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا السُّدُسُ فَإِن كَانُواْ أَكْثَرَ مِن ذَلِكَ فَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ فِي الثُّلُثِ ۔۔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...  And if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth. But if they are more than two, they share a third ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, in the 3rd Hijri year, the distribution of inheritance for a Kalalah person included the following provisions for the share of brothers and sisters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Kalalah person had only one brother or sister, their share was set at 1/6th of the estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of multiple brothers and sisters, they would all receive equal portions from 1/3rd of the estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a complication arose six years later when, in the 9th Hijri year, the writer of the Quran (Muhammad himself) seemingly forgot this ruling and claimed a new revelation, altering the share of brothers and sisters for a Kalalah person. The revised distribution was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surah al-Nisa, verse 176:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;verse__translation arabic-container&quot; data-translator-code=&quot;AR&quot;&gt;
&lt;dd class=&quot;arabic highlightable&quot;&gt;يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِى &lt;strong&gt;ٱلْكَلَٰلَةِ&lt;/strong&gt; ۚ إِنِ ٱمْرُؤٌا۟ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٌ وَلَهُۥٓ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ ۚ وَهُوَ يَرِثُهَآ إِن لَّمْ يَكُن لَّهَا وَلَدٌ ۚ فَإِن كَانَتَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُمَا ٱلثُّلُثَانِ مِمَّا تَرَكَ ۚ وَإِن كَانُوٓا۟ إِخْوَةً رِّجَالًا وَنِسَآءً فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ ۗ &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd class=&quot;arabic highlightable&quot;&gt;They request from you a [legal] ruling. Say, &quot;Allah gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants [as heirs].&quot; If a man dies, leaving no child but [only] a sister, she will have half of what he left. And he inherits from her if she [dies and] has no child. But if there are two sisters [or more], they will have two-thirds of what he left. If there are both brothers and sisters, the male will have the share of two females. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, in the 9th Hijri year, the distribution of inheritance for a Kalalah person introduced the following shares for brothers and sisters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single sister of a Kalalah person would receive half of the estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single brother of a Kalalah person would inherit the entirety of the estate (i.e., twice the share of a sister).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are two or more sisters, the remaining two-thirds of the estate would be divided equally among them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the presence of both brothers and sisters, the entire estate would be divided in a manner where brothers receive double the share of sisters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, these two Quranic verses present a significant contradiction concerning the shares of brothers and sisters of a Kalalah person, causing confusion among Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maududi wrote under the commentary of this verse of Surah al-Nisa 4:176 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=4&amp;amp;verse=172&amp;amp;to=176&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This verse was revealed long after the revelation of the rest of this surah. According to certain traditions, this verse was the very last Qur'anic verse to be revealed. (For these traditions, see Ibn Kathir's comments on this verse - Ed.) Even if this is disputed, it shows at least that this verse was revealed in 9 A.H., whereas the Muslims had been reciting the present surah, al-Nisa, for quite some time before that. It was for this reason that this verse was not included among the verses relating to inheritance mentioned at the beginning of the surah, but was attached to it at the end as an appendix (i.e. it is the last verse of Surah al-Nisa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId519254&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(5) Quranists (The Rejectors of Hadith) making their own new Quran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Quranists, who reject the authority of Hadith, also found themselves grappling with this mathematical error. As a result, they resorted to fabricating their own new Quran. They claimed that the wife's share, equivalent to 1/8 of the estate, should be allocated FIRST, and then the remaining portion should be distributed among the remaining heirs.Thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wife will get &lt;strong&gt;FIRST&lt;/strong&gt; the 1/8 of the whole estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then from the remaining estate, parents will get 1/3, and daughters will get 2/3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This makes 1/3 of parents  + 2/3 of daughters = 1 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cite verse 4:33 as evidence to support their belief that the wife's share should be given priority and allocated first from the entire estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us examine verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.33&quot;&gt;4:33&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.33&quot;&gt;4:33&lt;/a&gt;) And for all We (have) made heirs of what (is) left (by) the parents and the relatives. And those whom pledged your right hands - then give them their share. Indeed, Allah is over every thing a Witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere in this verse does it explicitly state that the wife should be given her share first from the entire estate. The idea of prioritizing the wife's share as the Quranists propose is a novel interpretation, similar to Umar Ibn Khattab's new solution of 'AWL or the different solution offered by Ibn Abbas/Shias. While this alternative may address the issue of inheritance, it does not resolve the underlying mathematical mistake in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the Quran claims that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;easy&quot; to understand&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.17&quot;&gt;54:17&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;manifest&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2&quot;&gt;27:1-2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/12.2&quot;&gt;12:2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then according to modern Quranist standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Quranic claim appears to be contradicted here, as the companions (Sahaba) and the billions of Muslims over the past 14 centuries, who have diligently read and contemplated the same Quran, were allegedly misguided according to modern Quranists.  They were supposedly unable to comprehend that the Quran intends for the wife to be given her share first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, the Quran is deemed to be deceptive in its assertion of clarity and ease of understanding. This raises doubts about following such an ambiguous book that allegedly leads its billions of followers astray despite their unwavering faith and continuous contemplation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is no such solution present in the Hadith literature either, which suggests giving the wife her share first. In fact, Muhammad himself recognized the impracticality of dividing the entire estate according to the Quranic rulings and instructed to distribute the remainder to the next male relative. Throughout the 1400-year history of Islam, this solution suggested by modern Quranists today has been absent.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no divine Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad had to create Islamic laws on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Muhammad was only a human and not well-educated, he made significant &quot;Mathematical Mistakes&quot; while distributing inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, your human intellect will clearly guide you to recognize that these Islamic rulings are ridiculous and lack wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, it is only women who have to suffer due to these absurd rulings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, let's consider a scenario where an individual passes away, leaving behind one daughter, parents, and wife. In such a case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The share of the daughter is 1/2 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“...and if there is only one daughter, then she shall have half the inheritance.” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.12&quot;&gt;4:12&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of shares in this case is calculated as follows: 1/2 for the daughter + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 0.96.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, if the deceased left behind $1000, according to the Qur'an, the judge would only need to distribute $960 among the heirs, leaving $40 remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted with this mathematical error, Muhammad found it impossible to rectify. As a solution, he advised them to allocate the remaining portion of the estate to the nearest &quot;male&quot; relative &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;(Source: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/23/2&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 1615a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;While the remaining amount of $40 USD in this particular scenario may appear insignificant for the next male relative, little did Muhammad know that it would turn out to be a fatal mistake. This error resulted in Islamic rulings that are deemed ridiculous, illogical, and unjust towards women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to provide a few examples to demonstrate the unjust nature of these inheritance laws, and your human intellect will naturally recognize their lack of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous online Islamic inheritance calculators are available. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://inheritance.ilmsummit.org/&quot;&gt;Calculator 1&lt;/a&gt; (A simple Islamic inheritance calculator).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inheritance-calculator.com/&quot;&gt;Calculator 2&lt;/a&gt; (A detailed Islamic inheritance calculator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use any online calculator to verify the following examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Example: Old Widow will get 25%, while a “MALE” relative (even a distant one like a cousin, or his son, or his grandson) will get 75% &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case where the deceased has no children but only a wife and a distant male relative (such as a cousin, or his son, or his grandson), the distribution of shares would be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widow will receive 25% of the inheritance, while the &quot;male&quot; relative, regardless of their proximity, will receive the remaining 75%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;dgSharesIndiv&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 37.4326%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; rules=&quot;all&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50.374%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Relative&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2943%; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Share Percentage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50.374%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Wife&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.277%; background-color: #bfedd2; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1/4&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2943%; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;25%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50.374%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any distant male Relative like &lt;br&gt;Cousin (or even his descendants)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.277%; background-color: #bfedd2; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;3/4&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2943%; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;75%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a wife who remains with her husband throughout her life, it may seem unjust that when she becomes a widow in her old age, she is entitled to only 25% of the inheritance. Meanwhile, the remaining 75% of the inheritance is awarded to a distant male relative, such as a cousin or any of his descendants, whom the deceased person may have never even encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this arrangement appear sensible to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you discern any divine wisdom in this particular Islamic law?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you believe that justice has been served to women by Muhammad/Allah in this regard?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the opposite scenario does not hold true. If a woman passes away, her husband will inherit all her property, regardless of the presence of her closest relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Example: Mother will get 33.33%, while distant relatives (like cousins, or his son, or his grandson) will get 66.67%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the deceased person has an old mother and a distant male relative, the distribution of shares would be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;dgSharesIndiv&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 38.9892%; height: 136px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; rules=&quot;all&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.2746%; height: 48px; background-color: #bfedd2; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Share Fraction&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2245%; height: 48px; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Share Percentage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 24px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50.4511%; height: 24px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Mother&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.2746%; height: 24px; background-color: #bfedd2; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1/3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2245%; height: 24px; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;33.33%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 64px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50.4511%; height: 64px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any distant male Relative like &lt;br&gt;Cousin (or even his descendants)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.2746%; height: 64px; background-color: #bfedd2; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;2/3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.2245%; height: 64px; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;66.67%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in this case, the old mother will receive only 33.33% of the inheritance, while a cousin (or his descendants, whom the deceased person may not have even encountered in his entire life) will receive 66.67%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might question the rationale behind this distribution and whether any divine wisdom can be perceived in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd Example: Sister will get much more share in inheritance than the mother and the wife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the sister is married, she will still receive a larger share of the inheritance compared to the mother or the wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 30.3167%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #bfedd2; width: 34.9161%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Share Fraction&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8; width: 43.1484%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Share Percentage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.1419%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Mother&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #bfedd2; width: 34.9161%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;2/5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8; width: 43.1484%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 22.1419%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Sister&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #bfedd2; width: 34.9161%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;3/5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #fbeeb8; width: 43.1484%; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;60%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the closer bond between a mother and her son, the illogical distribution of shares dictated by the Quran results in the sister receiving a larger inheritance portion than the mother (even if the sister is married).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the widow's share is even smaller than that of the mother, while the sister's share becomes even more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 30.6132%; height: 72px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even if a deceased person has a daughter, still half of the property will go to the sister (even if she is married). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 30.6132%; height: 72px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;width: 41.9894%; height: 24px; background-color: #fbeeb8; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 24px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 24.2129%; height: 24px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;Sister&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;width: 34.0206%; background-color: #bfedd2; height: 24px; border: 1px solid #000000;&quot;&gt;1/2&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These inequitable and absurd divisions are a result of the illogical Islamic laws of inheritance, which lack any divine wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId375244&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(2) When SHARES make MORE than the Estate (An &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance&quot;&gt;'Awl عول&lt;/a&gt; Case)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the case where an individual passes away, leaving behind three daughters, parents, and wife, the distribution of inheritance would be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The share of the three daughters is 2/3 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“...If (the heirs of the deceased are) more than two daughters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the share of the parents is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“... For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the wife’s share = 1/8 of the estate, based on the verse: &lt;em&gt;“…they get an eighth of that which you leave” [Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.12&quot;&gt;4:12&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of shares in this scenario is calculated as 2/3 for the daughters + 1/3 for the parents + 1/8 for the wife, resulting in a total of 1.125.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if the deceased left behind 1000 dinars, according to the Quran, the judge would require 1125 dinars to distribute among the heirs, which exceeds the available amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad passed away without providing any solution to rectify this mathematical mistake in the Quran or Hadith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, a similar case was presented to 'Umar Ibn Khattab, and he also found himself at a loss regarding what to do. However, someone suggested that he proportionally reduce the share of all heirs, and 'Umar adopted this &quot;self-made&quot; solution in an attempt to address the mathematical error in the Quran &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131556/objection-from-an-atheist-to-the-awl-process-in-cases-of-inheritance&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Ibn Abbas disagreed with 'Umar's approach, and Shia Muslims also have a differing perspective. They proposed an alternative &quot;self-fabricated&quot; solution (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bzu.edu.pk/PJIR/vol10/eng%206%20Shahbaz%20Cheema%2004-11-13.pdf#page=9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;In Islam, the Creator of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2017-01-universe-trillion-galaxies.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Two Trillion Galaxies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt; can’t add fractions, and thus Islamic Sharia has one Quranic Mathematical Error and 2 self-fabricated solutions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId111853&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(3) Linguistic Mistake in the Quran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.11&quot;&gt;4:11&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If (the heirs of the deceased are) &lt;strong&gt;more than two daughters&lt;/strong&gt;, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah is incorrectly using the phrase “&lt;strong&gt;more than two daughters&lt;/strong&gt;” when He actually wanted to say “&lt;strong&gt;two or more daughters&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a clear linguistic mistake, and it happened while no Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Muslim Scholars agree that two daughters will get 2/3 of the estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad himself distributed 2/3rd of the estate between two daughters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi, 2092:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The wife of Sa’d bin Rabi’ came with the two daughters of Sa’d to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, these are the two daughters of Sa’d. He was killed with you on the day of Uhud, and their paternal uncle has taken all that their father left behind, and a woman is only married for her wealth.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent until the Verse of inheritance was revealed to him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the brother of Sa’d bin Rabi’ and said: ‘Give the two daughters of Sa’d two thirds of his wealth, and give his wife on eighth, and take what is left.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of this error was significant enough that modern Muslim Quran translators had to resort to distorting the translation by changing it to &quot;two or more daughters.&quot; This can be observed in translations such as Yousuf Ali's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm&quot;&gt;Quran 4:11&lt;/a&gt;) Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, &lt;strong&gt;two or more&lt;/strong&gt;, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm&quot;&gt;Yusuf Ali, Saudi Revised Edition,1985&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there are other modern Quran translators who have also adopted this distorted translation of &quot;two or more daughters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to these modern translators, there are other translators who have chosen not to make any distortion in the translation and have accurately translated it as &quot;more than two daughters.&quot; Some of these translators include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is regrettable that certain modern Islamic apologists have deemed dishonesty permissible for themselves. They engage in distortions, concealment, and outright lies. However, the truth has a way of revealing itself despite their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;page-header&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId307784&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(4) Kalalah كلالة: Contradictions in the Quran &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;icons&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;float-end&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kalālah (Arabic: كلالة) is an Islamic inheritance term used to describe a deceased person who has an estate but lacks direct ascendants or descendants (meaning they have neither parents nor children).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad himself), initially revealed the rulings on inheritance during the third year of the Hijri calendar after the battle of Uhud, which resulted in the death of 70 Muslims and the subsequent need to divide their inheritance. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (Please see the introduction of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=4&amp;amp;verse=1&quot;&gt;Surah al-Nisa by Maududi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;com-content-article__body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that period in the third year of the Hijri calendar, the Quran prescribed the division of inheritance for a Kalalah individual (someone who has neither parents nor children) in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suran al-Nisa &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.12&quot;&gt;4:12&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;۔۔۔ وَإِن كَانَ رَجُلٌ يُورَثُ &lt;strong&gt;كَلاَلَةً&lt;/strong&gt; أَوِ امْرَأَةٌ وَلَهُ أَخٌ أَوْ أُخْتٌ فَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا السُّدُسُ فَإِن كَانُواْ أَكْثَرَ مِن ذَلِكَ فَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ فِي الثُّلُثِ ۔۔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...  And if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth. But if they are more than two, they share a third ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, in the 3rd Hijri year, the distribution of inheritance for a Kalalah person included the following provisions for the share of brothers and sisters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Kalalah person had only one brother or sister, their share was set at 1/6th of the estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of multiple brothers and sisters, they would all receive equal portions from 1/3rd of the estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a complication arose six years later when, in the 9th Hijri year, the writer of the Quran (Muhammad himself) seemingly forgot this ruling and claimed a new revelation, altering the share of brothers and sisters for a Kalalah person. The revised distribution was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surah al-Nisa, verse 176:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;verse__translation arabic-container&quot; data-translator-code=&quot;AR&quot;&gt;
&lt;dd class=&quot;arabic highlightable&quot;&gt;يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِى &lt;strong&gt;ٱلْكَلَٰلَةِ&lt;/strong&gt; ۚ إِنِ ٱمْرُؤٌا۟ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٌ وَلَهُۥٓ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ ۚ وَهُوَ يَرِثُهَآ إِن لَّمْ يَكُن لَّهَا وَلَدٌ ۚ فَإِن كَانَتَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُمَا ٱلثُّلُثَانِ مِمَّا تَرَكَ ۚ وَإِن كَانُوٓا۟ إِخْوَةً رِّجَالًا وَنِسَآءً فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلْأُنثَيَيْنِ ۗ &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd class=&quot;arabic highlightable&quot;&gt;They request from you a [legal] ruling. Say, &quot;Allah gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants [as heirs].&quot; If a man dies, leaving no child but [only] a sister, she will have half of what he left. And he inherits from her if she [dies and] has no child. But if there are two sisters [or more], they will have two-thirds of what he left. If there are both brothers and sisters, the male will have the share of two females. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, in the 9th Hijri year, the distribution of inheritance for a Kalalah person introduced the following shares for brothers and sisters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single sister of a Kalalah person would receive half of the estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single brother of a Kalalah person would inherit the entirety of the estate (i.e., twice the share of a sister).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are two or more sisters, the remaining two-thirds of the estate would be divided equally among them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the presence of both brothers and sisters, the entire estate would be divided in a manner where brothers receive double the share of sisters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, these two Quranic verses present a significant contradiction concerning the shares of brothers and sisters of a Kalalah person, causing confusion among Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maududi wrote under the commentary of this verse of Surah al-Nisa 4:176 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=4&amp;amp;verse=172&amp;amp;to=176&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This verse was revealed long after the revelation of the rest of this surah. According to certain traditions, this verse was the very last Qur'anic verse to be revealed. (For these traditions, see Ibn Kathir's comments on this verse - Ed.) Even if this is disputed, it shows at least that this verse was revealed in 9 A.H., whereas the Muslims had been reciting the present surah, al-Nisa, for quite some time before that. It was for this reason that this verse was not included among the verses relating to inheritance mentioned at the beginning of the surah, but was attached to it at the end as an appendix (i.e. it is the last verse of Surah al-Nisa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about Kalalah &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=153&amp;amp;catid=22&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId519254&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(5) Quranists (The Rejectors of Hadith) making their own new Quran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Quranists, who reject the authority of Hadith, also found themselves grappling with this mathematical error. As a result, they resorted to fabricating their own new Quran. They claimed that the wife's share, equivalent to 1/8 of the estate, should be allocated FIRST, and then the remaining portion should be distributed among the remaining heirs.Thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wife will get &lt;strong&gt;FIRST&lt;/strong&gt; the 1/8 of the whole estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then from the remaining estate, parents will get 1/3, and daughters will get 2/3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This makes 1/3 of parents  + 2/3 of daughters = 1 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cite verse 4:33 as evidence to support their belief that the wife's share should be given priority and allocated first from the entire estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us examine verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.33&quot;&gt;4:33&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.33&quot;&gt;4:33&lt;/a&gt;) And for all We (have) made heirs of what (is) left (by) the parents and the relatives. And those whom pledged your right hands - then give them their share. Indeed, Allah is over every thing a Witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere in this verse does it explicitly state that the wife should be given her share first from the entire estate. The idea of prioritizing the wife's share as the Quranists propose is a novel interpretation, similar to Umar Ibn Khattab's new solution of 'AWL or the different solution offered by Ibn Abbas/Shias. While this alternative may address the issue of inheritance, it does not resolve the underlying mathematical mistake in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the Quran claims that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;easy&quot; to understand&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.17&quot;&gt;54:17&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;manifest&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2&quot;&gt;27:1-2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/12.2&quot;&gt;12:2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then according to modern Quranist standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Quranic claim appears to be contradicted here, as the companions (Sahaba) and the billions of Muslims over the past 14 centuries, who have diligently read and contemplated the same Quran, were allegedly misguided according to modern Quranists.  They were supposedly unable to comprehend that the Quran intends for the wife to be given her share first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, the Quran is deemed to be deceptive in its assertion of clarity and ease of understanding. This raises doubts about following such an ambiguous book that allegedly leads its billions of followers astray despite their unwavering faith and continuous contemplation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is no such solution present in the Hadith literature either, which suggests giving the wife her share first. In fact, Muhammad himself recognized the impracticality of dividing the entire estate according to the Quranic rulings and instructed to distribute the remainder to the next male relative. Throughout the 1400-year history of Islam, this solution suggested by modern Quranists today has been absent.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The incident involving Abdullah Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi Sarh holds equal significance to the incident known as the &quot;Satanic Verses,&quot; as both events revealed that Muhammad was fabricating the revelation on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdullah Ibn Sa'd embraced Islam during the time of Mecca and attained the esteemed status of being a Companion of Muhammad, which holds great importance in the Islamic faith. Subsequently, he rose to the position of the scribe of the Quran (كاتب الوحي), a position even higher than that of a Companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Muhammad's guidance, he transcribed the revelations as they were dictated to him. However, one day, an incident occurred that opened Abdullah Ibn Sa'd's eyes, leading him to realize that the revelations were not of divine origin but were being fabricated by Muhammad himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon this realization, Abdullah Ibn Sa'd renounced Islam and became an apostate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1st Proof: &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&quot;Asbaab Al-Nuzool&quot; by Al-Wahidi Al-Naysaboori - Page 126 - Beirute's Cultural Libary Edition &quot;Tub'at Al-Maktabah Al-thakafiyyah Beirute&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Tafsir/Wahidi/6.93&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;عَن الْكَلْبِيّ عَن أبي صَالح عَن ابن عباس: &quot; قَوْلُهُ تَعَالَى: ( وَمَنْ قَالَ سَأُنْزِلُ مِثْلَ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ ) الأنعام/ 93 .نَزَلَتْ فِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ سَعْدِ بْنِ أَبِي سَرْحٍ، كَانَ قَدْ تَكَلَّمَ بِالْإِسْلَامِ، فَدَعَاهُ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ- صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ - ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ يَكْتُبُ لَهُ شَيْئًا، فَلَمَّا نَزَلَتِ الْآيَةُ الَّتِي فِي الْمُؤْمِنُونَ: (وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الْإِنْسَانَ مِنْ سُلَالَةٍ) أَمْلَاهَا عَلَيْهِ، فَلَمَّا انْتَهَى إِلَى قَوْلِهِ: (ثُمَّ أَنْشَأْنَاهُ خَلْقًا آخَرَ) عَجِبَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ فِي تَفْصِيلِ خَلْقِ الْإِنْسَانِ، فَقَالَ: تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ أَحْسَنُ الْخَالِقِينَ، فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ - صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ - (هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ عَلَيَّ)، فَشَكَّ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ حِينَئِذٍ وَقَالَ: لَئِنْ كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ صَادِقًا لَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ كَمَا أُوحِيَ إِلَيْهِ ، وَلَئِنْ كَانَ كَذَّابًا لَقَدْ قُلْتُ كَمَا قَالَ ، وَذَلِكَ قَوْلُهُ: ( وَمَنْ قَالَ سَأُنْزِلُ مِثْلَ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ ) وَارْتَدَّ عَنِ الْإِسْلَامِ ، &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Translation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This verse was revealed about 'Abd Allah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh. This man had declared his faith in Islam and so the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, called him one day to write something for him. When the verses regarding the believers were revealed (Verily, We created man from a product of wet earth…) [23:12-14], the Prophet dictated them to him. When he reached up to (and then produced it as another creation), 'Abd Allah expressed his amazement at the precision of man's creation &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;by saying (فتبارک اللّٰہ احسن الخالقین So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators!). The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: “This ['Abd Allah's last expression فتبارک اللّٰہ احسن الخالقین So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators!] is how it was revealed to me (so write them too in Quran)”.&lt;/strong&gt; At that point, doubt crept into 'Abd Allah. He said: “If Muhammad is truthful, then I was inspired just as he was; and if he is lying, I have uttered exactly what he did utter”. Hence Allah's words (and who saith: I will reveal the like of that which Allah hath revealed). The man renounced Islam. &lt;br&gt;This is also the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas according to the report of al-Kalbi. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Abdan informed us&amp;gt; Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Nu'aym&amp;gt; Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Umawi&amp;gt; Ahmad ibn 'Abd al-Jabbar&amp;gt; Yunus ibn Bukayr&amp;gt; Muhammad ibn Ishaq&amp;gt; Shurahbil ibn Sa'd who said: &lt;br&gt;“This verse was revealed about 'Abd Allah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh. The latter said: 'I will reveal the like of that which Allah has revealed', and renounced Islam. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, entered Mecca, this man fled to 'Uthman [ibn 'Affan] who was his milk brother. 'Uthman hid him until the people of Mecca felt safe. He then took him to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and secured an amnesty for him”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These words of ‘Abdullah Ibn Abi al-Sarh {فتبارک اللّٰہ احسن الخالقین So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators!!} still exist in the Quran to this day. (Verse &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/23.14&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;23:14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did Ibn Abi al-Sarh falsely accuse Muhammad? Certainly not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The truth is that Muhammad took possession of his words without taking care of any copyrights, and he forgot that he himself earlier challenged the pagans of Mecca, asserting that they could not produce a single verse like that of the Quran. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Ibn Abi al-Sarh witnessed firsthand that Muhammad was fabricating revelations on his own, which made him aware of this falsehood. Nevertheless, he decided to further test Muhammad to confirm his doubts. Muslim historians such as Waqidi, Ibn Athir, and Tabari have written that when Muhammad dictated the phrase &quot;Allah is All-Knowing All-Wise&quot; (عليم حکيم) to him, Ibn Abi al-Sarh wrote it in the reverse order (i.e., &quot;All-Wise All-Knowing&quot; - حکيم عليم). He then recited it back to Muhammad, who did not detect these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2nd Proof:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Waqidi recorded a comment by Ibn Abi al-Sarh (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/kitab-maghazi-waqidi/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%20%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%20%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%20%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3%20%D8%AC%202/page/n441/mode/2up?q=%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%8A&amp;amp;view=theater&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;قال فحدثني عبد الحميد بن جعفر عن يزيد بن أبي حبيب ، عن عطاء بن أبي رباح ، ... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;قالوا : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;وكان عبد الله بن سعد بن أبي سرح&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; يكتب لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم الوحي فربما أملى عليه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم سميع عليم فيكتب عليم حكيم فيقرأ رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فيقول كذلك الله ويقره . وافتتن وقال ما يدري محمد ما يقول إني لأكتب له ما شئت ، هذا الذي كتبت يوحى إلي كما يوحى إلى محمد .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi Sarh used to write down the revelations for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Sometimes, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would dictate to him (for example) 'All-Hearing, All-Knowing,' and he would write 'All-Knowing, All-Wise.' The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would recite it and say, 'This is also from Allah,' and approve it. However, Abdullah became confused and said, 'Muhammad does not know what he is saying. I can write whatever I wish for him. What I have written is revealed to me just as it is revealed to Muhammad.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After Ibn Abi al-Sarh renounced Islam, he told the people of Mecca, &quot;Your religion is better than his.&quot; (دينكم خير من دينه) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon learning about it, Muhammad became furious with him, realizing that it would be nearly impossible to determine the exact locations where Ibn Abi al-Sarh had introduced distortions in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to discredit Ibn Abi al-Sarh, Muhammad accused him of being a liar and declared the revelation of the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/6.93&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;6:93&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ومن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا أو قال أوحي إلي ولم يوح إليه شيء ومن قال سأنزل مثل ما أنزل الله&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad sought to defend himself against Ibn Abi al-Sarh's accusations. However, all of his excuses proved futile, and this verse now stands as undeniable evidence against him, especially for those discerning individuals who possess critical thinking abilities. We should express gratitude for this verse since, without it, Islam apologists would likely have dismissed the very existence of Abdullah Ibn Abi al-Sarh by deeming all traditions concerning him as &quot;weak.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3rd Proof:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ibn Jarir al-Tabari recorded the following tradition from ‘Ikrama in his Tafsir of Quran (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=6&amp;amp;tAyahNo=93&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;حدثنا القاسم، قال: ثنا الحسين، قال ثني حجاج، عن ابن جريج، عن عكرمة، قوله: { وَمَنْ أظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى على اللّهِ كَذِباً أوْ قالَ أُوحِيَ إليَّ وَلَمْ يُوحَ إلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ } قال: نزلت في مسيلمة أخي بني عديّ بن حنيفة فيما كان يسجِّع ويتكهن به. { وَمَنْ قالَ سأُنْزِلُ مِثْلَ ما أنْزَلَ الله } نزلت في عبد الله بن سعد بن أبي سَرْح، أخي بني عامر بن لؤي، كان يكتب للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وكان فيما يُملِي «عزيز حكيم»، فيكتب «غفور رحيم»، فيغيره، ثم يقرأ عليه كذا وكذا لما حوّل، فيقول: «نَعَمْ سواء» فرجع عن الإسلام ولحق بقريش وقال لهم: لقد كان ينزل عليه «عزيز حكيم»، فأحوّله ثم أقول لما أكتب، فيقول نعم سواء&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Al-Qasim told us: Al-Hussein narrated: Al-Hajjaj narrated: by Ibn Jurayh, by Ikrimah:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;His saying [i.e. Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/6.93&quot;&gt;6:93&lt;/a&gt;], &quot;And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&quot;. He [Ikrimah] said: This verse was revealed about Musaylamah the brother of Bani (children of) Uday bin Haneefah, for he [Musaylamah] was reciting poetry and prophesying.&lt;strong&gt; And &quot;I can reveal like what Allah hath revealed&quot; was revealed about Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi Al-Sarh, the brother of Bani (children of) Amir bin Lu'ai. He [Abdullah] used to write for the Prophet (SAW), and while he [Mohammad] was dictating &quot;Exalted in power, full of Wisdom'', he [Abdullah] would write it &quot;Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful&quot;, thus changing it. Then he [Abdullah] would read the changed verses to him [Mohammad], and he [Mohammad] would say, &quot;Yes [in approval], it's like this&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;So, he [Abdullah] reverted from Islam and followed Quraysh telling them, &quot;He [Mohammad] used to recite to me Exalted in power, full of Wisdom', and I would change it when I write it down, and he would tell me, 'Yes [in approval], it's the same [meaning].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حدثني محمد بن الحسين، قال: ثنا أحمد بن المفضل قال: ثنا أسباط، عن السديّ: { وَمَنْ أظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى على اللّهِ كَذِباً أوْ قالَ أُوحِيَ إليَّ وَلمْ يُوحَ إلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ... } إلى قوله: { تُجْزَوْنَ عذَابَ الهُونِ } قال: نزلت في عبد الله بن سعد بن أبي سرح أسلم، وكان يكتب للنبيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم، فكان إذا أملى عليه «سميعاً عليماً»، كتب هو: «عليماً حكيماً» وإذا قال: «عليماً حكيماً» كتب: «سميعاً عليماً». فشكّ وكفر، وقال: إن كان محمد يوحى إليه فقد أوحيَ إليّ، وإن كان الله ينزله فقد أنزلت مثل ما أنزل الله، قال محمد: «سميعاً عليماً»، فقلت أنا: «عليماً حكيماً». فلحق بالمشركين ، ووشى بعمار وجبير عند ابن الحضرميّ أو لبني عبد الدار، فأخذوهم فعذّبوا حتى كفروا. وجُدع أذن عمار يومئذ، فانطلق عمار إلى النبيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم، فأخبره بما لقي والذي أعطاهم من الكفر، فأبى النبيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يتولاه، فأنزل الله في شأن ابن أبي سَرح وعمار وأصحابه: مَنْ كَفَرَ باللّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ إيمَانِهِ إلاَّ مَنْ أُكْرِهَ وَقَلْبُهُ مُطْمَئِنٌّ بالإِيمَانِ وَلَكِنْ مَنْ شَرَحَ بالكُفْرِ صَدْرًا فالذي أُكره عمار وأصحابه، والذي شرح بالكفر صدراً فهو ابن أبي سرح.&lt;br&gt;Mohammad bin Al-Hussein spoke to me, he said: Ahmad bin Al-Mufdil narrated: Asbat narrated from As-Sudy: &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; [Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/6.93&quot;&gt;6:93&lt;/a&gt;], &quot;And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; until his [Allah] saying, &quot;ye receive your reward, a penalty of shame&quot;. &lt;br&gt;He [Al-Sudy] said: This verse was revealed about Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi Al-Sarh, he embraced Islam, and used to write [Quran revelations] for the Prophet (SAW). So, when the Prophet dictated him: &quot;Who heareth and knoweth all things&quot;, he'd write it: &quot;All-Knowing, All-Wise&quot;. So, he doubted and reverted. Then he said, &quot;If Mohammad gets inspiration, then I get inspiration too, and if Allah sent him his revelation, then I was sent the same thing. For when Mohammad said, 'Who heareth and knoweth all things' I'd say, 'All-Knowing, All-Wise'&quot; So he followed the Pagans, and he blew the cover of Ammar and Jubar [secret Muslims] to Ibn Al-Hudrumi or to Bani Abd Al-Dar, so they took them and tortured them until they reverted. Ammar's ear was cut off that day, so he [Ammar] went to the Prophet (SAW) and told him what had happened to him, but the Prophet (SAW) refused to handle his issue. So, Allah revealed about [Abdullah] Ibn Abi Al-Sarh and his companions, &quot;Anyone who, after accepting Faith in Allah, utters Unbelief, - except under compulsion, his heart remaining firm in Faith - but such as open their breast to Unbelief, on them is Wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a dreadful Penalty&quot; Who was &quot;under compulsion&quot; is Ammar and his companions, and who &quot;open their breast to Unbelief&quot; is [Abdullah] Ibn Abi Al-Sarh.&lt;/p&gt;

Then some people of Mecca came to him and asked him why he write the Quran for Ibn Abi Kubsha (i.e. Muhammad). Ibn Ibi Sarh replied that he writes Qruan according to his own wishes. Upon that Allah revealed this verse (Quran 6:93: And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imam al-Hakim recorded the following tradition in his book al-Mustadrak ‘ala al-Sahihain (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;ID=4237&amp;amp;bk_no=74&amp;amp;flag=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abu al-Abbas Muhammad bin Yaqoob – Ahmad bin ‘Abd al-Jabbar – Younus bin Bukayr — Ibn Ishaaq — Sharjeel bin S’ad:&lt;br&gt;This verse was revealed for Abdullah Ibn S’ad Ibn Abi Sarh  (Quran 6:93: And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&quot;). When Muhammad entered Mecca (after it’s victory), then he hid in the house of ‘Uthman Ibn Affan (the 3rd Caliph) who was his cousin. And when the situation in Mecca became calmer, he sought refuge for himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, Abdullah Ibn Sa'd inflicted a significant insult upon Muhammad, and Muhammad was unwilling to spare his life. However, through the intercession of Uthman, Muhammad eventually granted Abdullah refuge. Subsequently, Abdullah bin Sa'd joined the army and participated in looting during wars. The looted goods, which included enslaved women and war booty, became more important to him than Muhammad's claim as a true prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Narrated Sa'd:&lt;br&gt;On the day when Mecca was conquered, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave protection to the People except four men and two women and he named them. Ibn AbuSarh was one of them.&lt;br&gt;He then narrated the tradition. He said: Ibn AbuSarh hid himself with Uthman ibn Affan. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the people to take the oath of allegiance, he brought him and made him stand before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: Messenger of Allah, receive the oath of allegiance from him. He raised his head and looked at him thrice, denying him every time.

He said: It is not proper for a Prophet to have a &lt;strong&gt;treacherous eye&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Abu Dawud said: 'Abd Allah (b. Abi Sarh) was the foster brother of 'Uthman, and Walid b. 'Uqbah was his brother by mother, and 'Uthman inflicted on him hadd punishment when he drank wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: Sahih&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Let's read one comment on this tradition: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It shows the true nature of Mohammad. We have to admit that he was a very shrewd leader. He knew how to secure his alliances. Uthman was too important an ally for Mohammad to upset. He inwardly still wanted the scribe to be killed even though it was politically expedient for him to spare him. This was Mohammad's inner struggle that he wanted his followers to solve for him by killing the scribe without any trial. This would save face in front of Uthman as he could claim that he didn't want to kill him but some hothead follower did it anyway. His followers had the decency to not rush to judgement before their leader had made a clear call. Mohammad after accepting the scribe's pledge still bore enough enmity for him to ask his followers why they didn't kill him? They said they didn't get a sign. Mohammad told them that prophets can't make a treacherous signal with their eye. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This excuse from Muhammad is ridiculous. It means only that prophets can be treacherous in their heart but making an outward sign is what he considers treachery. An outward sign of treachery would have alerted Uthman and that is what Mohammad couldn't risk. He wanted his followers to read his mind and the treacherous intentions of his heart. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the man that 1.8 billion muslims follow. It shows how gullible they are. Then again they are never shown these hadiths or even if they are shown these hadiths they read them with the blindfolds of devotion on. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was the scribes forced conversion back in to the fold of Islam and to the credit of the scribe he was very grateful to his foster brother Uthman for saving his life. He remained a loyal ally of his foster brother.&lt;/em&gt; (Credit: &lt;a class=&quot;wM6scouPXXsFDSZmZPHRo DjcdNGtVXPcxG0yiFXIoZ _23wugcdiaj44hdfugIAlnX &quot; style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/curiousjack6/&quot; data-testid=&quot;comment_author_link&quot;&gt;curiousjack6)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Islamic Apologists: The tradition about Verses 23:12-14 is not correct &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have previously presented the tradition regarding verses 23:12-14 (refer to Proof Nr. 1 above), which includes the words of Abdullah Ibn Sa'd as part of the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some Islam apologists (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamic-awareness.org/quran/sources/sarh/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) have argued that this tradition cannot be accurate because Surah Muminun (in which these verses 23:12-14 are found) was revealed during the Meccan period, while Abdullah Ibn Abi Sarh embraced Islam later in the Medinan period. As evidence, they cite the following tradition from the book &quot;Asad-ul-Ghaba&quot; by Ibn Athir (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211130144827/https://al-maktaba.org/book/1110/6110&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أسلم قبل الفتح، وهاجر إِلَى رَسُول اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وكان يكتب الوحي لرسول اللَّه صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ثم ارتد مشركًا، وصار إِلَى قريش بمكة&lt;br&gt;He (‘Abdullah Ibn S’ad Ibn abi Sarh) accepted Islam before the “Victory of Mecca”. He migrated to the Prophet (when he was already in Medina). He was a scribe of revelation, but later he apostated and went back to Quraysh in Mecca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the early period of Islam, there was a widespread awareness of the truth behind various incidents that occurred during Muhammad's time and the corresponding revelations of Quranic verses. Consequently, many people accurately narrated traditions about these events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some of these traditions painted Islam and Muhammad in a negative light, and later Muslims sought to preserve the honor of their religion by discrediting them. As a result, these later Muslims employed two strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They fabricated numerous Ahadith (narrations) to counter the traditions that revealed the actual truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They developed the field of 'Ilm-ul-Hadith (Science of Hadith) and categorized certain traditions as 'weak' if they contradicted the honor of Islam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their efforts, these Muslim scholars and fabricators often made mistakes and were unable to concoct enough falsehoods to conceal the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One specific case that exemplifies this situation is that of Ibn Abi Sarh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tradition of Ibn Atheer, which claims that Ibn Abi Sarh accepted Islam during the period in Medina, is a solitary report without any chain of narration to support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, the revelation of Surah Muminun (Verses 23:12-14) took place in Mecca, contradicting the claim in Ibn Atheer's tradition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, Surah al-Anam (Verse 6:93) was also revealed in Mecca, wherein Allah Himself testifies to the presence of a person claiming to have fabricated a revelation. This serves as irrefutable evidence that Abdullah Ibn Abi Sarh did indeed accept Islam during the Meccan period, and the incident of his apostasy occurred in Mecca.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, the traditions presented in proofs 3, 4, 5, and 6 also pertain to Surah al-Anam (Verse 6:93) and confirm that the incident involving Abdullah Ibn Abi Sarh occurred during the Meccan period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, proof 4 mentions the torture of Ammar Yasir and his companions, a well-known event that unquestionably transpired during the Meccan period. Consequently, it further supports the notion that the incident involving Ibn Abi Sarh took place during the Meccan period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these arguments highlight the &quot;double standards&quot; employed by apologists of Islam, who dismiss all these pieces of evidence while accepting the solitary report by Ibn Athir, which not only contradicts other traditions but also goes against the Quranic text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic Apologists: It was not Ibn Abi Sarh, but a Christian man who used to claim to add to the Quran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists bring the following tradition to deny Ibn Abi Sarh's role:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3617&quot;&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari 3617&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Anas: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-`Imran, and he used to &lt;strong&gt;write (the revelations)&lt;/strong&gt; for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &quot;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&quot; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &quot;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&quot; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this is a &quot;singular&quot; tradition which has no other chain of narration. And we already know that later coming Muslim generations were masters of FABRICATING false Ahadith to safeguard their religion. Please read our article: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mod-articles-category-title &quot; href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/hadith/114-the-fabrication-of-ahadith-in-order-to-save-the-honor-of-islam&quot;&gt;The Hadith Fabrication Factory of Muslims: 131 Traditions claimed it was Ishaaq who was slaughtered, while 133 Traditions were fabricated that claimed it was Ismael who was slaughtered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, even this hadith also proves that a companion of Muhammad, who was also a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Scribe&lt;/strong&gt; of the Quran&quot;, left Islam and became Christian again. This is in itself a question mark upon the so-called linguistic miracle of the Quran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The incident involving Abdullah Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi Sarh holds equal significance to the incident known as the &quot;Satanic Verses,&quot; as both events revealed that Muhammad was fabricating the revelation on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdullah Ibn Sa'd embraced Islam during the time of Mecca and attained the esteemed status of being a Companion of Muhammad, which holds great importance in the Islamic faith. Subsequently, he rose to the position of the scribe of the Quran (كاتب الوحي), a position even higher than that of a Companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Muhammad's guidance, he transcribed the revelations as they were dictated to him. However, one day, an incident occurred that opened Abdullah Ibn Sa'd's eyes, leading him to realize that the revelations were not of divine origin but were being fabricated by Muhammad himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon this realization, Abdullah Ibn Sa'd renounced Islam and became an apostate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;عَن الْكَلْبِيّ عَن أبي صَالح عَن ابن عباس: &quot; قَوْلُهُ تَعَالَى: ( وَمَنْ قَالَ سَأُنْزِلُ مِثْلَ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ ) الأنعام/ 93 .نَزَلَتْ فِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ سَعْدِ بْنِ أَبِي سَرْحٍ، كَانَ قَدْ تَكَلَّمَ بِالْإِسْلَامِ، فَدَعَاهُ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ- صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ - ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ يَكْتُبُ لَهُ شَيْئًا، فَلَمَّا نَزَلَتِ الْآيَةُ الَّتِي فِي الْمُؤْمِنُونَ: (وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الْإِنْسَانَ مِنْ سُلَالَةٍ) أَمْلَاهَا عَلَيْهِ، فَلَمَّا انْتَهَى إِلَى قَوْلِهِ: (ثُمَّ أَنْشَأْنَاهُ خَلْقًا آخَرَ) عَجِبَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ فِي تَفْصِيلِ خَلْقِ الْإِنْسَانِ، فَقَالَ: تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ أَحْسَنُ الْخَالِقِينَ، فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ - صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ - (هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ عَلَيَّ)، فَشَكَّ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ حِينَئِذٍ وَقَالَ: لَئِنْ كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ صَادِقًا لَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ كَمَا أُوحِيَ إِلَيْهِ ، وَلَئِنْ كَانَ كَذَّابًا لَقَدْ قُلْتُ كَمَا قَالَ ، وَذَلِكَ قَوْلُهُ: ( وَمَنْ قَالَ سَأُنْزِلُ مِثْلَ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ ) وَارْتَدَّ عَنِ الْإِسْلَامِ ، &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Translation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This verse was revealed about 'Abd Allah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh. This man had declared his faith in Islam and so the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, called him one day to write something for him. When the verses regarding the believers were revealed (Verily, We created man from a product of wet earth…) [23:12-14], the Prophet dictated them to him. When he reached up to (and then produced it as another creation), 'Abd Allah expressed his amazement at the precision of man's creation &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;by saying (فتبارک اللّٰہ احسن الخالقین So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators!). The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: “This ['Abd Allah's last expression فتبارک اللّٰہ احسن الخالقین So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators!] is how it was revealed to me (so write them too in Quran)”.&lt;/strong&gt; At that point, doubt crept into 'Abd Allah. He said: “If Muhammad is truthful, then I was inspired just as he was; and if he is lying, I have uttered exactly what he did utter”. Hence Allah's words (and who saith: I will reveal the like of that which Allah hath revealed). The man renounced Islam. &lt;br&gt;This is also the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas according to the report of al-Kalbi. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Abdan informed us&amp;gt; Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Nu'aym&amp;gt; Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Umawi&amp;gt; Ahmad ibn 'Abd al-Jabbar&amp;gt; Yunus ibn Bukayr&amp;gt; Muhammad ibn Ishaq&amp;gt; Shurahbil ibn Sa'd who said: &lt;br&gt;“This verse was revealed about 'Abd Allah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh. The latter said: 'I will reveal the like of that which Allah has revealed', and renounced Islam. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, entered Mecca, this man fled to 'Uthman [ibn 'Affan] who was his milk brother. 'Uthman hid him until the people of Mecca felt safe. He then took him to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and secured an amnesty for him”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These words of ‘Abdullah Ibn Abi al-Sarh {فتبارک اللّٰہ احسن الخالقین So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators!!} still exist in the Quran to this day. (Verse &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/23.14&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;23:14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did Ibn Abi al-Sarh falsely accuse Muhammad? Certainly not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The truth is that Muhammad took possession of his words without taking care of any copyrights, and he forgot that he himself earlier challenged the pagans of Mecca, asserting that they could not produce a single verse like that of the Quran. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Ibn Abi al-Sarh witnessed firsthand that Muhammad was fabricating revelations on his own, which made him aware of this falsehood. Nevertheless, he decided to further test Muhammad to confirm his doubts. Muslim historians such as Waqidi, Ibn Athir, and Tabari have written that when Muhammad dictated the phrase &quot;Allah is All-Knowing All-Wise&quot; (عليم حکيم) to him, Ibn Abi al-Sarh wrote it in the reverse order (i.e., &quot;All-Wise All-Knowing&quot; - حکيم عليم). He then recited it back to Muhammad, who did not detect these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2nd Proof:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Waqidi recorded a comment by Ibn Abi al-Sarh (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/kitab-maghazi-waqidi/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%20%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%20%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%20%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3%20%D8%AC%202/page/n441/mode/2up?q=%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%8A&amp;amp;view=theater&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;قال فحدثني عبد الحميد بن جعفر عن يزيد بن أبي حبيب ، عن عطاء بن أبي رباح ، ... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;قالوا : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;وكان عبد الله بن سعد بن أبي سرح&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; يكتب لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم الوحي فربما أملى عليه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم سميع عليم فيكتب عليم حكيم فيقرأ رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فيقول كذلك الله ويقره . وافتتن وقال ما يدري محمد ما يقول إني لأكتب له ما شئت ، هذا الذي كتبت يوحى إلي كما يوحى إلى محمد .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi Sarh used to write down the revelations for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Sometimes, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would dictate to him (for example) 'All-Hearing, All-Knowing,' and he would write 'All-Knowing, All-Wise.' The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would recite it and say, 'This is also from Allah,' and approve it. However, Abdullah became confused and said, 'Muhammad does not know what he is saying. I can write whatever I wish for him. What I have written is revealed to me just as it is revealed to Muhammad.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After Ibn Abi al-Sarh renounced Islam, he told the people of Mecca, &quot;Your religion is better than his.&quot; (دينكم خير من دينه) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon learning about it, Muhammad became furious with him, realizing that it would be nearly impossible to determine the exact locations where Ibn Abi al-Sarh had introduced distortions in the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to discredit Ibn Abi al-Sarh, Muhammad accused him of being a liar and declared the revelation of the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/6.93&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;6:93&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ومن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا أو قال أوحي إلي ولم يوح إليه شيء ومن قال سأنزل مثل ما أنزل الله&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad sought to defend himself against Ibn Abi al-Sarh's accusations. However, all of his excuses proved futile, and this verse now stands as undeniable evidence against him, especially for those discerning individuals who possess critical thinking abilities. We should express gratitude for this verse since, without it, Islam apologists would likely have dismissed the very existence of Abdullah Ibn Abi al-Sarh by deeming all traditions concerning him as &quot;weak.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3rd Proof:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ibn Jarir al-Tabari recorded the following tradition from ‘Ikrama in his Tafsir of Quran (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=6&amp;amp;tAyahNo=93&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;حدثنا القاسم، قال: ثنا الحسين، قال ثني حجاج، عن ابن جريج، عن عكرمة، قوله: { وَمَنْ أظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى على اللّهِ كَذِباً أوْ قالَ أُوحِيَ إليَّ وَلَمْ يُوحَ إلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ } قال: نزلت في مسيلمة أخي بني عديّ بن حنيفة فيما كان يسجِّع ويتكهن به. { وَمَنْ قالَ سأُنْزِلُ مِثْلَ ما أنْزَلَ الله } نزلت في عبد الله بن سعد بن أبي سَرْح، أخي بني عامر بن لؤي، كان يكتب للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وكان فيما يُملِي «عزيز حكيم»، فيكتب «غفور رحيم»، فيغيره، ثم يقرأ عليه كذا وكذا لما حوّل، فيقول: «نَعَمْ سواء» فرجع عن الإسلام ولحق بقريش وقال لهم: لقد كان ينزل عليه «عزيز حكيم»، فأحوّله ثم أقول لما أكتب، فيقول نعم سواء&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Al-Qasim told us: Al-Hussein narrated: Al-Hajjaj narrated: by Ibn Jurayh, by Ikrimah:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;His saying [i.e. Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/6.93&quot;&gt;6:93&lt;/a&gt;], &quot;And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&quot;. He [Ikrimah] said: This verse was revealed about Musaylamah the brother of Bani (children of) Uday bin Haneefah, for he [Musaylamah] was reciting poetry and prophesying.&lt;strong&gt; And &quot;I can reveal like what Allah hath revealed&quot; was revealed about Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi Al-Sarh, the brother of Bani (children of) Amir bin Lu'ai. He [Abdullah] used to write for the Prophet (SAW), and while he [Mohammad] was dictating &quot;Exalted in power, full of Wisdom'', he [Abdullah] would write it &quot;Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful&quot;, thus changing it. Then he [Abdullah] would read the changed verses to him [Mohammad], and he [Mohammad] would say, &quot;Yes [in approval], it's like this&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;So, he [Abdullah] reverted from Islam and followed Quraysh telling them, &quot;He [Mohammad] used to recite to me Exalted in power, full of Wisdom', and I would change it when I write it down, and he would tell me, 'Yes [in approval], it's the same [meaning].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4th Proof:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Tabari recorded the following tradition in his Tafsir from as-Sudy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=6&amp;amp;tAyahNo=93&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حدثني محمد بن الحسين، قال: ثنا أحمد بن المفضل قال: ثنا أسباط، عن السديّ: { وَمَنْ أظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ افْتَرَى على اللّهِ كَذِباً أوْ قالَ أُوحِيَ إليَّ وَلمْ يُوحَ إلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ... } إلى قوله: { تُجْزَوْنَ عذَابَ الهُونِ } قال: نزلت في عبد الله بن سعد بن أبي سرح أسلم، وكان يكتب للنبيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم، فكان إذا أملى عليه «سميعاً عليماً»، كتب هو: «عليماً حكيماً» وإذا قال: «عليماً حكيماً» كتب: «سميعاً عليماً». فشكّ وكفر، وقال: إن كان محمد يوحى إليه فقد أوحيَ إليّ، وإن كان الله ينزله فقد أنزلت مثل ما أنزل الله، قال محمد: «سميعاً عليماً»، فقلت أنا: «عليماً حكيماً». فلحق بالمشركين ، ووشى بعمار وجبير عند ابن الحضرميّ أو لبني عبد الدار، فأخذوهم فعذّبوا حتى كفروا. وجُدع أذن عمار يومئذ، فانطلق عمار إلى النبيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم، فأخبره بما لقي والذي أعطاهم من الكفر، فأبى النبيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يتولاه، فأنزل الله في شأن ابن أبي سَرح وعمار وأصحابه: مَنْ كَفَرَ باللّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ إيمَانِهِ إلاَّ مَنْ أُكْرِهَ وَقَلْبُهُ مُطْمَئِنٌّ بالإِيمَانِ وَلَكِنْ مَنْ شَرَحَ بالكُفْرِ صَدْرًا فالذي أُكره عمار وأصحابه، والذي شرح بالكفر صدراً فهو ابن أبي سرح.&lt;br&gt;Mohammad bin Al-Hussein spoke to me, he said: Ahmad bin Al-Mufdil narrated: Asbat narrated from As-Sudy: &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; [Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/6.93&quot;&gt;6:93&lt;/a&gt;], &quot;And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; until his [Allah] saying, &quot;ye receive your reward, a penalty of shame&quot;. &lt;br&gt;He [Al-Sudy] said: This verse was revealed about Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abi Al-Sarh, he embraced Islam, and used to write [Quran revelations] for the Prophet (SAW). So, when the Prophet dictated him: &quot;Who heareth and knoweth all things&quot;, he'd write it: &quot;All-Knowing, All-Wise&quot;. So, he doubted and reverted. Then he said, &quot;If Mohammad gets inspiration, then I get inspiration too, and if Allah sent him his revelation, then I was sent the same thing. For when Mohammad said, 'Who heareth and knoweth all things' I'd say, 'All-Knowing, All-Wise'&quot; So he followed the Pagans, and he blew the cover of Ammar and Jubar [secret Muslims] to Ibn Al-Hudrumi or to Bani Abd Al-Dar, so they took them and tortured them until they reverted. Ammar's ear was cut off that day, so he [Ammar] went to the Prophet (SAW) and told him what had happened to him, but the Prophet (SAW) refused to handle his issue. So, Allah revealed about [Abdullah] Ibn Abi Al-Sarh and his companions, &quot;Anyone who, after accepting Faith in Allah, utters Unbelief, - except under compulsion, his heart remaining firm in Faith - but such as open their breast to Unbelief, on them is Wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a dreadful Penalty&quot; Who was &quot;under compulsion&quot; is Ammar and his companions, and who &quot;open their breast to Unbelief&quot; is [Abdullah] Ibn Abi Al-Sarh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5th Proof:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Abi al-Hatim recorded the following tradition in his Tafsir (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/2501_%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A-%D8%AC-%D9%A4/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_294&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7624 حدثنا أبي ثنا ابن نفيل الحراني ثنا مسكين بن بكير عن معان رفاعة قال: سمعت ابا خلف الأعمى قال: كان ابن أبي سرح يكتب للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم الوحي، فاتى أهل مكة فقالوا: يا ابن أبي السرح، كيف كتبت لابن أبي كبشة القران؟ قال: كنت اكتب كيف شئت. فانزل الله تعالى: ومن اظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا. قوله تعالى: أو قال أوحي إلي ولم يوح اليه شيء&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abi Thana ibn Nufayl al-Hirani — Maskeen bin Bukayr — Ma’an Rifah – Aba Khalf al-Aami, who said:&lt;br&gt;Ibn Abi Sarh used to write down the revelation for the prophet. Then some people of Mecca came to him and asked him why he write the Quran for Ibn Abi Kubsha (i.e. Muhammad). Ibn Ibi Sarh replied that he writes Qruan according to his own wishes. Upon that Allah revealed this verse (Quran 6:93: And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6th Proof:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam al-Hakim recorded the following tradition in his book al-Mustadrak ‘ala al-Sahihain (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;ID=4237&amp;amp;bk_no=74&amp;amp;flag=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4419 - فحدثنا أبو العباس محمد بن يعقوب ، ثنا أحمد بن عبد الجبار ، ثنا يونس بن بكير ، عن ابن إسحاق قال : حدثني شرحبيل بن سعد قال : &quot; نزلت في عبد الله بن أبي سرح &quot; ومن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا أو قال أوحي إلي ولم يوح إليه شيء ومن قال سأنزل مثل ما أنزل الله فلما دخل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم مكة فر إلى عثمان بن عفان رضي الله عنه ، وكان أخاه من الرضاعة ، فغيبه عنده حتى اطمأن أهل مكة ، ثم أتى به رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم فاستأمن &quot; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu al-Abbas Muhammad bin Yaqoob – Ahmad bin ‘Abd al-Jabbar – Younus bin Bukayr — Ibn Ishaaq — Sharjeel bin S’ad:&lt;br&gt;This verse was revealed for Abdullah Ibn S’ad Ibn Abi Sarh  (Quran 6:93: And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, &quot;It has been inspired to me,&quot; while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, &quot;I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed.&quot;). When Muhammad entered Mecca (after it’s victory), then he hid in the house of ‘Uthman Ibn Affan (the 3rd Caliph) who was his cousin. And when the situation in Mecca became calmer, he sought refuge for himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, Abdullah Ibn Sa'd inflicted a significant insult upon Muhammad, and Muhammad was unwilling to spare his life. However, through the intercession of Uthman, Muhammad eventually granted Abdullah refuge. Subsequently, Abdullah bin Sa'd joined the army and participated in looting during wars. The looted goods, which included enslaved women and war booty, became more important to him than Muhammad's claim as a true prophet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7th Proof:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Abdullah ibn AbuSarh &lt;strong&gt;used to write (the revelation)&lt;/strong&gt; for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). &lt;strong&gt;Satan made him slip, and he joined the infidels&lt;/strong&gt;. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded to kill him on the day of Conquest (of Mecca). Uthman ibn Affan sought protection for him. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave him protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hadithprophet.com/hadith-3792.html&quot;&gt;Sahih&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muhammad wanted to kill Ibn Abi Sarh even through deception&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2683&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2683&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Narrated Sa'd:&lt;br&gt;On the day when Mecca was conquered, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) gave protection to the People except four men and two women and he named them. Ibn AbuSarh was one of them.&lt;br&gt;He then narrated the tradition. He said: Ibn AbuSarh hid himself with Uthman ibn Affan. When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the people to take the oath of allegiance, he brought him and made him stand before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: Messenger of Allah, receive the oath of allegiance from him. He raised his head and looked at him thrice, denying him every time. After the third time he &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;received his oath&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;He then turned to his Companions and said: Is not there any intelligent man among you who would stand to this (man) when he saw me desisting from receiving the oath of allegiance, and kill him?&lt;/strong&gt; They replied: We do not know, Messenger of Allah, what lies in your heart; did you not give us a hint with your eye? He said: It is not proper for a Prophet to have a &lt;strong&gt;treacherous eye&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Abu Dawud said: 'Abd Allah (b. Abi Sarh) was the foster brother of 'Uthman, and Walid b. 'Uqbah was his brother by mother, and 'Uthman inflicted on him hadd punishment when he drank wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: Sahih&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Let's read one comment on this tradition: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It shows the true nature of Mohammad. We have to admit that he was a very shrewd leader. He knew how to secure his alliances. Uthman was too important an ally for Mohammad to upset. He inwardly still wanted the scribe to be killed even though it was politically expedient for him to spare him. This was Mohammad's inner struggle that he wanted his followers to solve for him by killing the scribe without any trial. This would save face in front of Uthman as he could claim that he didn't want to kill him but some hothead follower did it anyway. His followers had the decency to not rush to judgement before their leader had made a clear call. Mohammad after accepting the scribe's pledge still bore enough enmity for him to ask his followers why they didn't kill him? They said they didn't get a sign. Mohammad told them that prophets can't make a treacherous signal with their eye. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This excuse from Muhammad is ridiculous. It means only that prophets can be treacherous in their heart but making an outward sign is what he considers treachery. An outward sign of treachery would have alerted Uthman and that is what Mohammad couldn't risk. He wanted his followers to read his mind and the treacherous intentions of his heart. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the man that 1.8 billion muslims follow. It shows how gullible they are. Then again they are never shown these hadiths or even if they are shown these hadiths they read them with the blindfolds of devotion on. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was the scribes forced conversion back in to the fold of Islam and to the credit of the scribe he was very grateful to his foster brother Uthman for saving his life. He remained a loyal ally of his foster brother.&lt;/em&gt; (Credit: &lt;a class=&quot;wM6scouPXXsFDSZmZPHRo DjcdNGtVXPcxG0yiFXIoZ _23wugcdiaj44hdfugIAlnX &quot; style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/curiousjack6/&quot; data-testid=&quot;comment_author_link&quot;&gt;curiousjack6)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Islamic Apologists: The tradition about Verses 23:12-14 is not correct &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have previously presented the tradition regarding verses 23:12-14 (refer to Proof Nr. 1 above), which includes the words of Abdullah Ibn Sa'd as part of the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some Islam apologists (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamic-awareness.org/quran/sources/sarh/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) have argued that this tradition cannot be accurate because Surah Muminun (in which these verses 23:12-14 are found) was revealed during the Meccan period, while Abdullah Ibn Abi Sarh embraced Islam later in the Medinan period. As evidence, they cite the following tradition from the book &quot;Asad-ul-Ghaba&quot; by Ibn Athir (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211130144827/https://al-maktaba.org/book/1110/6110&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أسلم قبل الفتح، وهاجر إِلَى رَسُول اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وكان يكتب الوحي لرسول اللَّه صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ثم ارتد مشركًا، وصار إِلَى قريش بمكة&lt;br&gt;He (‘Abdullah Ibn S’ad Ibn abi Sarh) accepted Islam before the “Victory of Mecca”. He migrated to the Prophet (when he was already in Medina). He was a scribe of revelation, but later he apostated and went back to Quraysh in Mecca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the early period of Islam, there was a widespread awareness of the truth behind various incidents that occurred during Muhammad's time and the corresponding revelations of Quranic verses. Consequently, many people accurately narrated traditions about these events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some of these traditions painted Islam and Muhammad in a negative light, and later Muslims sought to preserve the honor of their religion by discrediting them. As a result, these later Muslims employed two strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They fabricated numerous Ahadith (narrations) to counter the traditions that revealed the actual truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They developed the field of 'Ilm-ul-Hadith (Science of Hadith) and categorized certain traditions as 'weak' if they contradicted the honor of Islam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their efforts, these Muslim scholars and fabricators often made mistakes and were unable to concoct enough falsehoods to conceal the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One specific case that exemplifies this situation is that of Ibn Abi Sarh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tradition of Ibn Atheer, which claims that Ibn Abi Sarh accepted Islam during the period in Medina, is a solitary report without any chain of narration to support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, the revelation of Surah Muminun (Verses 23:12-14) took place in Mecca, contradicting the claim in Ibn Atheer's tradition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, Surah al-Anam (Verse 6:93) was also revealed in Mecca, wherein Allah Himself testifies to the presence of a person claiming to have fabricated a revelation. This serves as irrefutable evidence that Abdullah Ibn Abi Sarh did indeed accept Islam during the Meccan period, and the incident of his apostasy occurred in Mecca.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, the traditions presented in proofs 3, 4, 5, and 6 also pertain to Surah al-Anam (Verse 6:93) and confirm that the incident involving Abdullah Ibn Abi Sarh occurred during the Meccan period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, proof 4 mentions the torture of Ammar Yasir and his companions, a well-known event that unquestionably transpired during the Meccan period. Consequently, it further supports the notion that the incident involving Ibn Abi Sarh took place during the Meccan period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these arguments highlight the &quot;double standards&quot; employed by apologists of Islam, who dismiss all these pieces of evidence while accepting the solitary report by Ibn Athir, which not only contradicts other traditions but also goes against the Quranic text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic Apologists: It was not Ibn Abi Sarh, but a Christian man who used to claim to add to the Quran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists bring the following tradition to deny Ibn Abi Sarh's role:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3617&quot;&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari 3617&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Anas: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-`Imran, and he used to &lt;strong&gt;write (the revelations)&lt;/strong&gt; for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &quot;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&quot; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &quot;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&quot; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this is a &quot;singular&quot; tradition which has no other chain of narration. And we already know that later coming Muslim generations were masters of FABRICATING false Ahadith to safeguard their religion. Please read our article: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mod-articles-category-title &quot; href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/hadith/114-the-fabrication-of-ahadith-in-order-to-save-the-honor-of-islam&quot;&gt;The Hadith Fabrication Factory of Muslims: 131 Traditions claimed it was Ishaaq who was slaughtered, while 133 Traditions were fabricated that claimed it was Ismael who was slaughtered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, even this hadith also proves that a companion of Muhammad, who was also a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Scribe&lt;/strong&gt; of the Quran&quot;, left Islam and became Christian again. This is in itself a question mark upon the so-called linguistic miracle of the Quran. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId961194&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Summary:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unfortunate that in the incident of IFK, the Most Important issues never come to light, which totally EXPOSE Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad wanted his followers to stop DOUBTING Aisha, as it was alo a threat to his claim of prophethood. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;after one month&lt;/strong&gt; of the IFK incident, Muhammad claimed the revelation of the fowlling verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did the &lt;strong&gt;faithful&lt;/strong&gt; men and women &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;not (immediately) think well of their people&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. 'Aisha and Safwan)&lt;/strong&gt; when they heard this, and said: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;This is a clear lie?&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; ... Why did you not say as soon as you heard it: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;It is not for us to speak of it&lt;/span&gt;? God preserve us, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;it is a great slander!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, according to Aisha's testimony in &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

  &quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141&lt;/a&gt;, Muhammad's behavior diverged from these expectations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doubted Aisha immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not declare it a lie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He discussed the matter with others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not immediately denounce it as slander&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

  &quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141&lt;/a&gt; is a long Hadith, where 'Aisha is giving stunning details about the incident of IFK and what happened during the next one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the testimony of 'Aisha in this Hadith, the CLASH between the Quran and Muhammad's Actions was even wider than that. 'Aisha testified that during this one-month period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad immediately began to &lt;strong&gt;DOUBT&lt;/strong&gt; 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad's &lt;strong&gt;kindness&lt;/strong&gt; towards 'Aisha diminished, even when she was ill. He would only greet her and then leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad &lt;strong&gt;initiated investigations&lt;/strong&gt; into 'Aisha's character, seeking information from Ali, Zayd (the adopted son), and Barira (the maid-servant) within his home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He consulted Ali about the possibility of &lt;strong&gt;DIVORCING&lt;/strong&gt; 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even after one month, Muhammad continued to doubt 'Aisha, &lt;strong&gt;asking her to confess and repent&lt;/strong&gt; if she had committed a sin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha expressed deep disappointment with Muhammad's behavior, to the extent that &lt;strong&gt;she refused to engage in direct conversation with him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She also &lt;strong&gt;refused to testify&lt;/strong&gt; her innocence to Muhammad, believing that he had already been influenced by planted slander and would not accept her testimony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha further explained that if she were to falsely confess to the sin, Muhammad would readily believe it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha &lt;strong&gt;turned her face away from Muhammad&lt;/strong&gt; and laid on the other side of the bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite Muhammad claiming divine revelation that proved 'Aisha's innocence, &lt;strong&gt;she remained upset with Muhammad's behavior.&lt;/strong&gt; When her mother asked her to accompany Muhammad, &lt;strong&gt;'Aisha refused to go with him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a logical perspective, it becomes apparent that Muhammad used the revelation to reprimand others for the very actions he himself had committed. In reality, Muhammad's behaviour inflicted the greatest pain on 'Aisha, surpassing the actions of any other individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the important parts of this Hadith (with our comments to make it easy for people to undersand):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad doubted 'Aisha's Charter]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: ... &quot;After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers &lt;strong&gt;while I was unaware of anything of all that,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and leave&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad started consulting 'Ali about divorcing 'Aisha]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said) When the Divine Inspiration was delayed, &lt;strong&gt;Allah's Messenger called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me ... &lt;/strong&gt;(Muhammad then also asked Barira, the maid-servant about 'Aisha's charater) and Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad kept on doubting 'Aisha till the end ... i.e. even after ony month]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said that she went to her parents' house, while she was disturbed from those rumors and from Muhammad's behavior. Then after one month) Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. &lt;strong&gt;He had never sat with me since that day of the slander.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.&lt;/strong&gt; Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-and so about you; &lt;strong&gt;if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[It was Muhammad, who probably caused most pain to 'Aisha with his attitude of doubting her]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said) Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger .' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, &lt;strong&gt;'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me.&lt;/strong&gt; By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' &lt;strong&gt;Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed;&lt;/strong&gt; ... ('Aisha further said after that immediately revelation started coming to Muhammad and he said to her) 'O `Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger). I replied, &lt;strong&gt;'By Allah, I will not go to him,&lt;/strong&gt; and I praise none but Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discrepancies between Quranic verses and Muhammad's reported behaviour in the Ifk incident are evident. However, this raises an important &lt;strong&gt;OBJECTION&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muslim Objection:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-Muslims believe that the Quran and Muhammad are one and the same (i.e., Muhammad himself was creating the revelations). How, then, can such a clash occur between the Quran and Muhammad's actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt; This clash occurred due to Muhammad's &lt;strong&gt;DOUBLE behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Behaviour (outside the house):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad tried to save Aisha from slander&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was partly to protect his claim of Prophethood. It was INDIRECTLY challenging his claim of Prophethood as people were making FUN of him for not being able to control his wife&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Behaviour (inside the house):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the house, Muhammad was fully doubtful about Aisha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He consulted Ali about divorcing her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad likely assumed people would not learn about his private actions. However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aisha later exposed the inside story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revealed Muhammad's contradictory behaviours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual behavior ultimately led to the apparent clash between Quranic Verses (which were meant ONLY for Public) and Muhammad's actions (inside the house).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId278223&quot;&gt;Muhammad 'outside' the house VS Muhammad 'inside' the house &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId70939&quot;&gt;Muhammad was the one who caused the most pain to 'Aisha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId877911&quot;&gt;How did Muhammad know Allah would 'soon' reveal the verses of innocence of 'Aisha after one month?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId182187&quot;&gt;Quranic order to lash the eyewitnesses if their number is less than 4 (even if they are telling the truth)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId242783&quot;&gt;The Quranic claim that Pure Men have only the pure Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId620933&quot;&gt;The Role of so-called 'Islamic Modesty' in the incident of Ifk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId548081&quot;&gt;Why did Muhammad use to take his wives during the battles?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an expedition, the Muslim caravan accidentally left 'Aisha behind at the camp. Safwan, a companion of Muhammad, later found her in the camp and they spent the night there. The next day, Safwan brought 'Aisha back to Muhammad. However, rumours began to circulate, accusing 'Aisha and Safwan of committing adultery. This incident, known as the IFK, posed a danger to Muhammad and indirectly affected his claim of prophethood. Despite having multiple wives and slave women, Muhammad remained childless.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;After almost one month, Muhammad made his first public appearance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4757&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4757&lt;/a&gt;), where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;He declared it (even without any revelation) to be a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;forged story&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, by making an &lt;strong&gt;'&lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt;' that he never saw anything bad in the character of 'Aisha or Safwan even before this incident. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And then he commanded Muslims to kill 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai, who used this incident to question Muhammad's prophethood. Nevertheless, the people of 'Abdullah's tribe refused to obey Muhammad, and they defended him. The two tribes of Muslims almost started a fight upon it. Thus, Muhammad failed to kill him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai was not alone. In fact, almost all Sahaba were doubtful about 'Aisha, which was making them doubtful about Muhammad's prophethood too indirectly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please note that in that first public appearance (which happened one month after the incident of Ifk), the declaration of 'Aisha's and Safwan's innocence was not even dependent upon any revelation, but it was dependent upon a simple argument, which he had already known even before this incident (i.e. there was nothing wrong in their characters).&lt;strong&gt; So, why did Muhammad wait for one month for this first public appearance in order to claim 'Aisha's innocence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The rebellion of the Muslim tribe led by 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai further jeopardized Muhammad's position, as he began to lose influence over his followers as a prophet. In response, Muhammad, as he often did, claimed to receive new &quot;revelations.&quot; Not only did he assert a revelation regarding 'Aisha's innocence, but he claimed a series of revelations that served his political purposes concerning this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;'Aisha (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4757&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4757&lt;/a&gt;) stated that two days after Muhammad's first public appearance (which itself happened after one month of the incident), he approached her and claimed to have received a revelation, specifically Surah an-Nur. Now, let us examine this Surah an-Nur and how it conveniently aligned with Muhammad's political objectives (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.1?context=30&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3598db;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Verses 1-3]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ... The woman and the man guilty of fornication, flog each one of them with a hundred stripes ...The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Purpose of these verses&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This verse should serve as an &quot;argument&quot; for the innocence of 'Aisha, i.e. since Muhammad is neither a fornicator nor a polytheist himself, thus he also didn't marry any female fornicator (i.e. 'Aisha). Nevertheless, this so-called Quranic Argument is flawed and totally against the logic and indeed a poor pious woman may get a husband who is a fornicator and vice versa. It only shows the colours of 'Human Error' in the so-called divine Revelation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3598db;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Verse 4]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As for those persons who charge chaste women with false accusations but do not produce &lt;strong&gt;four witnesses&lt;/strong&gt;, flog them with eighty stripes and never accept their evidence afterwards, for they themselves are transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Purpose of this verse&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;   Muhammad wanted to punish all those companions who doubted 'Aisha (as, by doing so, they were &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDIRECTLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; making the position of Muhammad as a prophet doubtful and weak too. After one month, Muhammad asked his companions to kill 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai (the alleged Hypocrite according to Islam). However, Muhammad failed in his plan and 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai managed to evade Muhammad's plan to have him killed (Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 &lt;/a&gt;). However, Muhammad still desired to set an example and impose severe punishment on those companions who testified against the character of 'Aisha and indirectly weakened his position as a prophet. To achieve this, Muhammad introduced a completely new condition, unprecedented in prior history. He decreed that if there were fewer than four witnesses, then the remaining 3 witnesses would be subjected to 80 lashes, even if their testimony was truthful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3598db;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Verses 5-25]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ... Why did the &lt;strong&gt;faithful&lt;/strong&gt; men and women &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;not (immediately) think well of their people&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. 'Aisha and Safwan)&lt;/strong&gt; when they heard this, and said: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;This is a Clear Lie?&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; ... Why did you not say as soon as you heard it: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;It is not for us to speak of it&lt;/span&gt;? God preserve us, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;it is a great Slander!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Purpose of these verses&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; It was not only 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai along with 3 more Sahaba, but almost all the companions were doubting 'Aisha and thus Muhammad's prophethood too indirectly. Thus, Muhammad used these verses in order to rebuke all of them, so that they stop doubting 'Aisha's character and Muhammad's claim of prophethood. But the issue is, inside the home:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Muhammad was himself fully doubtful about 'Aisha,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;and he himself didn't immediately think well of 'Aisha,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;and he himself didn't say: &quot;This is a lie clear&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;And he himself didn't ask for 4 witnesses, but he directly started consultation to divorce 'Aisha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It proves that Muhammad was himself doing exactly the opposite of what the Quran was saying. Or in more simple words, Muhammad declared the revelation of these verses in order to rebuke others, and he thought his own story (i.e. he was himself doubting 'Aisha) would perhaps not come to the light. But 'Aisha indeed told the inside story later too, exposing Muhammad that he was no different than those Sahaba who were doubting 'Aisha's character.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3598db;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Verse 26]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;strong&gt;mpure women are for impure men and impure men for impure women, and pure women are for pure men and pure men for pure women.&lt;/strong&gt; They are free from those scandals which the slanderers utter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Purpose of this verse&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Once more, the author of the Quran (Muhammad himself) employed this as an 'argument' to persuade people to believe in 'Aisha's innocence. However, this Quranic argument is fundamentally flawed and illogical. For example, the Quran itself claims that the wife of Lut was not righteous etc. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId278223&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad '&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;outside&lt;/span&gt;' the house vs. Muhammad '&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;inside&lt;/span&gt;' the house &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us examine Muhammad's conduct outside the house during his first public appearance, which occurred approximately a month later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4757&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4757&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Aisha: ... Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up and addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, he said, &quot;To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'forged story'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; against my wife. By Allah, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do not know anything bad about her&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man (i.e. Safwan) about whom I have &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;never known anything bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus In public:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad &lt;strong&gt;totally denied&lt;/strong&gt; this slander as a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;forged story&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And when he said {By Allah, &lt;strong&gt;I do not know anything bad about her&lt;/strong&gt;}, then he gave the impression that neither he ever doubted 'Aisha, nor he ever doubted Safwan (the man who found 'Aisha) right from the beginning. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad's fortune took a turn for the worse when 'Aisha revealed the complete opposite behaviour of Muhammad during the incident that transpired &quot;inside the house.&quot; It became evident that not only did Muhammad doubt 'Aisha from the beginning, but he continued to harbour doubts until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad doubted 'Aisha's Charter]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: ... &quot;After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers &lt;strong&gt;while I was unaware of anything of all that,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and leave&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad started consulting 'Ali about divorcing 'Aisha]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said) When the Divine Inspiration was delayed, &lt;strong&gt;Allah's Messenger called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me ... &lt;/strong&gt;(Muhammad then also asked Barira, the maid-servant about 'Aisha's charater) and Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad kept on doubting 'Aisha till the end ... i.e. even after ony month]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said that she went to her parents' house, while she was disturbed from those rumors and from Muhammad's behavior. Then after one month) Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. &lt;strong&gt;He had never sat with me since that day of the slander.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.&lt;/strong&gt; Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-and so about you; &lt;strong&gt;if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[It was Muhammad, who probably caused most pain to 'Aisha with his attitude of doubting her]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said) Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger .' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, &lt;strong&gt;'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me.&lt;/strong&gt; By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' &lt;strong&gt;Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed;&lt;/strong&gt; ... ('Aisha further said after that immediately revelation started coming to Muhammad and he said to her) 'O `Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger). I replied, &lt;strong&gt;'By Allah, I will not go to him,&lt;/strong&gt; and I praise none but Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it may not have been in Muhammad's interest to publicly express doubt about 'Aisha to those outside his household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this serves as evidence that Muhammad may have misled people by dismissing the story as &quot;forged&quot; while privately harbouring doubts about 'Aisha's character throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a logical perspective, one questions whether a person who resorts to such deception in pursuit of personal interests can truly be considered a genuine Prophet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId70939&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad continued with his claim of never doubting 'Aisha (but this time with the help of REVELATION)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his initial public appearance, Muhammad presented himself to the people outside of his household as if he had never doubted 'Aisha's character. After one month, he continued with the same strategy, but this time his claim came with the extra help of the revelation. Muhammad was deeply angered by those who continued to believe in the incident, which posed a threat to his claim of prophethood. In order to admonish these individuals, Muhammad claimed the revelation of the following Quranic verses approximately one month later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.12?context=4&quot;&gt;Quran 24:12-16&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did the &lt;strong&gt;faithful&lt;/strong&gt; men and women &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;not (immediately) think well of their people&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. 'Aisha and Safwan)&lt;/strong&gt; when they heard this, and said: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;This is a clear lie?&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; ... Why did you not say as soon as you heard it: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;It is not for us to speak of it&lt;/span&gt;? God preserve us, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;it is a great slander!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these verses, the Quran put these conditions of faithful men and women i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;thinking well about 'Aisha and Safwan immediately. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Absolutely not speaking of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;and denying it as an obvious falsehood, lie and a slander. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problem occurred when later, 'Aisha also told the story, which happened &lt;strong&gt;inside the house&lt;/strong&gt; during that period, where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;It was also Muhammad himself who neither thought good about 'Aisha,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;nor did he stop speaking about it, but he started consulting others about divorcing 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;nor did Muhammad immediately deny it as an obvious falsehood and a big lie and a slander. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, 'Aisha provides a different perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad began to doubt 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad's kindness towards 'Aisha diminished, even when she was ill. He would only greet her and then leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad initiated investigations into 'Aisha's character, seeking information from Ali, Zayd (the adopted son), and Barira (the maid-servant) within his home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He consulted them about the possibility of divorcing 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even after one month, Muhammad continued to doubt 'Aisha, asking her to confess and repent if she had committed a sin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha expressed deep disappointment with Muhammad's behavior, to the extent that she refused to engage in direct conversation with him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She also refused to testify her innocence to Muhammad, believing that he had already been influenced by planted slander and would not accept her testimony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha further explained that if she were to falsely confess to a sin, Muhammad would readily believe it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha turned her face away from Muhammad and laid on the other side of the bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite Muhammad claiming divine revelation that proved 'Aisha's innocence, she remained upset with his behavior. When her mother asked her to accompany Muhammad, 'Aisha refused to go with him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a logical perspective, it becomes apparent that Muhammad used the revelation to reprimand others for the very actions he himself had committed. In reality, Muhammad's behaviour inflicted the greatest pain on 'Aisha, surpassing the actions of any other individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId877911&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How did Muhammad know Allah would '&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;soon&lt;/span&gt;' reveal the verses of innocence of 'Aisha after one month?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the entire month, there was no revelation affirming 'Aisha's innocence. However, Muhammad visited 'Aisha at her parent's house and assured her that Allah would soon reveal the verses regarding her innocence. Astonishingly, merely a minute later, Muhammad claimed that the revelation had arrived, absolving 'Aisha of all accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of the slander. &lt;strong&gt;A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case&lt;/strong&gt;. Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so and so about you; if you are innocent,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;then soon Allah will reveal your innocence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness&lt;/strong&gt; for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance ... &lt;strong&gt;(Aisha said) 'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, &lt;/strong&gt;and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me ... Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed ... &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, by Allah, before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left his seat&lt;/strong&gt; and before any of the household left,&lt;strong&gt; the Divine inspiration came to Allah's Messenger&lt;/strong&gt; (about my innocence)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Muhammad's ability to claim that a revelation would soon come for 'Aisha's innocence indicates that he had full control over the timing of revelations. It is quite remarkable that the revelation arrived instantly, right after Muhammad and 'Aisha concluded their conversation, just as Muhammad had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This serves as evidence that there is no divine entity, Allah, in the heavens, but rather Muhammad himself was the source of these revelations, creating them at will and on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId182187&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quranic order to lash the eyewitnesses if their number is less than 4 (even if they are telling the truth)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the incident of Ifk, Muhammad asserted the revelation of verse 24 of Surah Nur. This verse introduced a completely novel condition that had no prior or subsequent precedent in the world. It mandated that if the number of witnesses is less than 4, all of them should be subjected to 80 lashes, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;even if their testimony is truthful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.4&quot;&gt;Surah Nur 24:4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses - &lt;strong&gt;lash them with eighty lashes&lt;/strong&gt; and do not accept from them testimony ever after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary motive behind the revelation of this order by the writer of the Quran (Muhammad) can be attributed to the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad aimed to establish &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Abdullah Ibn Ubai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a deterrent example for those who doubted 'Aisha's innocence and, by extension, Muhammad's prophethood. His plan to eliminate 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai as a punishment fell through when he managed to evade it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, Muhammad faced a significant challenge when the Muslim tribe led by 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai openly defied his authority as a prophet, fueling tensions that could potentially escalate into conflict. This situation posed a threat to Muhammad's influence over his followers, thereby necessitating a decisive action to regain control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, even if 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai managed to escape punishment, Muhammad still sought to administer severe penalties to someone else as a means of setting an example for all those who harbored doubts about his prophethood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up on the pulpit and complained about &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; before his companions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and he was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on quietening them till they became silent and so did he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human logic dictates that the Islamic ruling of lashing witnesses, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;even if they are telling the truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, goes against rationality. This illogical directive raises doubts about the divine origin of the revelations and suggests that Muhammad himself may have been fabricating them to suit his political agenda. Such evidence of &quot;human error&quot; undermines the credibility of the revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, many modern Muslim countries have recognized the absurdity of this Quranic ruling and have chosen to abandon it. Today, witnesses in cases of adultery are not subjected to the punishment of 80 lashes, even if their numbers are less than four. This pragmatic approach reflects a departure from the rigid application of an outdated and unreasonable directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId242783&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Quranic claim that Pure Men have only the pure Women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quranic assertion that pure men have only pure women is presented as an argument supporting 'Aisha's innocence, as she was married to a pure man, Muhammad, according to the revelation in Surah Nur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.3?context=24&quot;&gt;Surah Nur 4:3 and 4:26&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist, and that has been made unlawful to the believers ۔۔۔ Women impure are for men impure, and men impure for women impure and women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity: these are not affected by what people say: for them there is forgiveness, and a provision honorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir wrote in his Tafsir under verse 26 of Surah Nur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Evil women are for evil men and evil men are for evil women, and good women are for good men and good men are for good women.&lt;em&gt; This also necessarily refers back to what they said, i.e., &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allah would not have made `A'ishah the wife of His Messenger unless she had been good, because he is the best of the best of mankind. If she had been evil, she would not have been a suitable partner either according to His Laws or His decree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://m.qtafsir.com/Surah-An-Noor/The-Goodness-of-%60Aishah-becau---&quot;&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Nur 24:26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Qur'an itself provides examples that challenge the claim that pure men only have pure women. The story of Lut's wife, who was not pure-hearted despite Lut being a pure man, and the example of Pharaoh's wife, who was considered pure while Pharaoh himself was not, contradict this argument. Additionally, the wife of Noah is also mentioned as not being pure. These examples reveal the flaws in the argument put forth by the Qur'an and Muhammad, indicating the human nature of the revelation and raising doubts about the existence of Allah and the authenticity of Muhammad's claims of being a prophet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId620933&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Role of so-called 'Islamic Modesty' in the incident of Ifk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the so-called 'Islamic Modesty' plays a &lt;strong&gt;negative&lt;/strong&gt; role in this incident too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: ... &lt;strong&gt;I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt)&lt;/strong&gt;. So we went on till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. &lt;strong&gt;(In the meanwhile) the people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it&lt;/strong&gt;...They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of hijab in Islam requires the complete separation of women from unrelated men in society. Even conversations and interactions between men and women are considered inappropriate and contrary to Islamic modesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, during this journey, Aisha was concealed from the view of men behind the curtains of her howdah. Since men and women were not even allowed to greet each other, the men who lifted her howdah couldn't confirm her presence by simply saying hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of these circumstances were severe. Aisha spent the entire month in tears and pain, despite her innocence. Even Muhammad, who harbored no kindness towards her, allowed this slander to affect him, further exacerbating the situation. This division among Muslims led to a dangerous conflict between the two factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Imposing such restrictions in the name of Islamic modesty goes against human nature. These unnatural limitations instill paranoia and skepticism within society, resulting in a disturbed state of mind. Muslims struggle to comprehend why companions like Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah slandered Aisha. However, it seems that these unnatural restrictions have made members of Islamic society so paranoid that they start believing in things that are not actually true. (Note: Muslims still hold high regard for these two companions by using &quot;Radhi Allahu 'Anhu&quot; when referring to them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, thousands of &lt;strong&gt;honor killings&lt;/strong&gt; occur in Islamic societies, based solely on suspicions and paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause of this month-long ordeal was the restriction on interaction between men and women in the name of Islamic modesty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, see this lack of interaction between them when Safwan found 'Asiha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated 'Aisha: ... While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me &lt;strong&gt;as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed)&lt;/strong&gt;. So I woke up when he recited Istirja' (i.e. &quot;Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un&quot;) as soon as he recognized me, &lt;strong&gt;I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word&lt;/strong&gt;, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;How could Islam be considered a 'religion of nature' when it has made it so difficult that even in emergencies, men and women don't even exchange a single word?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;What could have happened if they had greeted each other, and Safwan had asked her about the problem in detail (and perhaps helped her in finding her necklace), why she was alone there, and if she needed some other kind of help too in that situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in present times, Muslim women and girls face difficulty in seeking assistance without hesitation in various fields, whether it be from male doctors, male teachers, or others. The imposition of these unnatural restrictions drains a significant amount of energy from society, rendering half of the Islamic society, namely women, practically useless and unable to contribute to productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId548081&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why did Muhammad use to take his wives during the battles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the pre-Islamic era known as Jahiliyyah in Arabia, kings ruled like dictators. They forbade their common soldiers from bringing their wives along on journeys, yet they themselves indulged in the company of their own wives, despite the added burden it placed on their armies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad, too, followed the practices of these dictatorial kings. The incident of Ifk took place when Muhammad took 'Aisha with him on a particular journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same Hadith regarding the incident of Ifk, 'Aisha narrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots amongst his wives, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to take with him the one on whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the Ghazwat (in which the incident of Ifk happened) which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId961194&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Summary:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unfortunate that in the incident of IFK, the Most Important issues never come to light, which totally EXPOSE Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad wanted his followers to stop DOUBTING Aisha, as it was alo a threat to his claim of prophethood. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;after one month&lt;/strong&gt; of the IFK incident, Muhammad claimed the revelation of the fowlling verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did the &lt;strong&gt;faithful&lt;/strong&gt; men and women &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;not (immediately) think well of their people&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. 'Aisha and Safwan)&lt;/strong&gt; when they heard this, and said: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;This is a clear lie?&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; ... Why did you not say as soon as you heard it: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;It is not for us to speak of it&lt;/span&gt;? God preserve us, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;it is a great slander!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, according to Aisha's testimony in &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

  &quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141&lt;/a&gt;, Muhammad's behavior diverged from these expectations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doubted Aisha immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not declare it a lie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He discussed the matter with others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not immediately denounce it as slander&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;relative pointer-events-auto a cursor-pointer

  &quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141&lt;/a&gt; is a long Hadith, where 'Aisha is giving stunning details about the incident of IFK and what happened during the next one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the testimony of 'Aisha in this Hadith, the CLASH between the Quran and Muhammad's Actions was even wider than that. 'Aisha testified that during this one-month period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad immediately began to &lt;strong&gt;DOUBT&lt;/strong&gt; 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad's &lt;strong&gt;kindness&lt;/strong&gt; towards 'Aisha diminished, even when she was ill. He would only greet her and then leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad &lt;strong&gt;initiated investigations&lt;/strong&gt; into 'Aisha's character, seeking information from Ali, Zayd (the adopted son), and Barira (the maid-servant) within his home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He consulted Ali about the possibility of &lt;strong&gt;DIVORCING&lt;/strong&gt; 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even after one month, Muhammad continued to doubt 'Aisha, &lt;strong&gt;asking her to confess and repent&lt;/strong&gt; if she had committed a sin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha expressed deep disappointment with Muhammad's behavior, to the extent that &lt;strong&gt;she refused to engage in direct conversation with him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She also &lt;strong&gt;refused to testify&lt;/strong&gt; her innocence to Muhammad, believing that he had already been influenced by planted slander and would not accept her testimony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha further explained that if she were to falsely confess to the sin, Muhammad would readily believe it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha &lt;strong&gt;turned her face away from Muhammad&lt;/strong&gt; and laid on the other side of the bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite Muhammad claiming divine revelation that proved 'Aisha's innocence, &lt;strong&gt;she remained upset with Muhammad's behavior.&lt;/strong&gt; When her mother asked her to accompany Muhammad, &lt;strong&gt;'Aisha refused to go with him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a logical perspective, it becomes apparent that Muhammad used the revelation to reprimand others for the very actions he himself had committed. In reality, Muhammad's behaviour inflicted the greatest pain on 'Aisha, surpassing the actions of any other individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the important parts of this Hadith (with our comments to make it easy for people to undersand):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad doubted 'Aisha's Charter]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: ... &quot;After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers &lt;strong&gt;while I was unaware of anything of all that,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and leave&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad started consulting 'Ali about divorcing 'Aisha]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said) When the Divine Inspiration was delayed, &lt;strong&gt;Allah's Messenger called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me ... &lt;/strong&gt;(Muhammad then also asked Barira, the maid-servant about 'Aisha's charater) and Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad kept on doubting 'Aisha till the end ... i.e. even after ony month]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said that she went to her parents' house, while she was disturbed from those rumors and from Muhammad's behavior. Then after one month) Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. &lt;strong&gt;He had never sat with me since that day of the slander.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.&lt;/strong&gt; Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-and so about you; &lt;strong&gt;if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[It was Muhammad, who probably caused most pain to 'Aisha with his attitude of doubting her]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said) Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger .' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, &lt;strong&gt;'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me.&lt;/strong&gt; By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' &lt;strong&gt;Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed;&lt;/strong&gt; ... ('Aisha further said after that immediately revelation started coming to Muhammad and he said to her) 'O `Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger). I replied, &lt;strong&gt;'By Allah, I will not go to him,&lt;/strong&gt; and I praise none but Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discrepancies between Quranic verses and Muhammad's reported behaviour in the Ifk incident are evident. However, this raises an important &lt;strong&gt;OBJECTION&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muslim Objection:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-Muslims believe that the Quran and Muhammad are one and the same (i.e., Muhammad himself was creating the revelations). How, then, can such a clash occur between the Quran and Muhammad's actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt; This clash occurred due to Muhammad's &lt;strong&gt;DOUBLE behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Behaviour (outside the house):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad tried to save Aisha from slander&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was partly to protect his claim of Prophethood. It was INDIRECTLY challenging his claim of Prophethood as people were making FUN of him for not being able to control his wife&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Behaviour (inside the house):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the house, Muhammad was fully doubtful about Aisha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He consulted Ali about divorcing her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad likely assumed people would not learn about his private actions. However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aisha later exposed the inside story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revealed Muhammad's contradictory behaviours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual behavior ultimately led to the apparent clash between Quranic Verses (which were meant ONLY for Public) and Muhammad's actions (inside the house).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId278223&quot;&gt;Muhammad 'outside' the house VS Muhammad 'inside' the house &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId70939&quot;&gt;Muhammad was the one who caused the most pain to 'Aisha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId877911&quot;&gt;How did Muhammad know Allah would 'soon' reveal the verses of innocence of 'Aisha after one month?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId182187&quot;&gt;Quranic order to lash the eyewitnesses if their number is less than 4 (even if they are telling the truth)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId242783&quot;&gt;The Quranic claim that Pure Men have only the pure Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId620933&quot;&gt;The Role of so-called 'Islamic Modesty' in the incident of Ifk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId548081&quot;&gt;Why did Muhammad use to take his wives during the battles?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an expedition, the Muslim caravan accidentally left 'Aisha behind at the camp. Safwan, a companion of Muhammad, later found her in the camp and they spent the night there. The next day, Safwan brought 'Aisha back to Muhammad. However, rumours began to circulate, accusing 'Aisha and Safwan of committing adultery. This incident, known as the IFK, posed a danger to Muhammad and indirectly affected his claim of prophethood. Despite having multiple wives and slave women, Muhammad remained childless.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;After almost one month, Muhammad made his first public appearance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4757&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4757&lt;/a&gt;), where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;He declared it (even without any revelation) to be a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;forged story&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, by making an &lt;strong&gt;'&lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt;' that he never saw anything bad in the character of 'Aisha or Safwan even before this incident. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And then he commanded Muslims to kill 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai, who used this incident to question Muhammad's prophethood. Nevertheless, the people of 'Abdullah's tribe refused to obey Muhammad, and they defended him. The two tribes of Muslims almost started a fight upon it. Thus, Muhammad failed to kill him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai was not alone. In fact, almost all Sahaba were doubtful about 'Aisha, which was making them doubtful about Muhammad's prophethood too indirectly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please note that in that first public appearance (which happened one month after the incident of Ifk), the declaration of 'Aisha's and Safwan's innocence was not even dependent upon any revelation, but it was dependent upon a simple argument, which he had already known even before this incident (i.e. there was nothing wrong in their characters).&lt;strong&gt; So, why did Muhammad wait for one month for this first public appearance in order to claim 'Aisha's innocence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The rebellion of the Muslim tribe led by 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai further jeopardized Muhammad's position, as he began to lose influence over his followers as a prophet. In response, Muhammad, as he often did, claimed to receive new &quot;revelations.&quot; Not only did he assert a revelation regarding 'Aisha's innocence, but he claimed a series of revelations that served his political purposes concerning this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;'Aisha (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4757&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4757&lt;/a&gt;) stated that two days after Muhammad's first public appearance (which itself happened after one month of the incident), he approached her and claimed to have received a revelation, specifically Surah an-Nur. Now, let us examine this Surah an-Nur and how it conveniently aligned with Muhammad's political objectives (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.1?context=30&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3598db;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Verses 1-3]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ... The woman and the man guilty of fornication, flog each one of them with a hundred stripes ...The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Purpose of these verses&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This verse should serve as an &quot;argument&quot; for the innocence of 'Aisha, i.e. since Muhammad is neither a fornicator nor a polytheist himself, thus he also didn't marry any female fornicator (i.e. 'Aisha). Nevertheless, this so-called Quranic Argument is flawed and totally against the logic and indeed a poor pious woman may get a husband who is a fornicator and vice versa. It only shows the colours of 'Human Error' in the so-called divine Revelation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3598db;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Verse 4]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As for those persons who charge chaste women with false accusations but do not produce &lt;strong&gt;four witnesses&lt;/strong&gt;, flog them with eighty stripes and never accept their evidence afterwards, for they themselves are transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Purpose of this verse&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;   Muhammad wanted to punish all those companions who doubted 'Aisha (as, by doing so, they were &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDIRECTLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; making the position of Muhammad as a prophet doubtful and weak too. After one month, Muhammad asked his companions to kill 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai (the alleged Hypocrite according to Islam). However, Muhammad failed in his plan and 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai managed to evade Muhammad's plan to have him killed (Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 &lt;/a&gt;). However, Muhammad still desired to set an example and impose severe punishment on those companions who testified against the character of 'Aisha and indirectly weakened his position as a prophet. To achieve this, Muhammad introduced a completely new condition, unprecedented in prior history. He decreed that if there were fewer than four witnesses, then the remaining 3 witnesses would be subjected to 80 lashes, even if their testimony was truthful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3598db;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Verses 5-25]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ... Why did the &lt;strong&gt;faithful&lt;/strong&gt; men and women &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;not (immediately) think well of their people&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. 'Aisha and Safwan)&lt;/strong&gt; when they heard this, and said: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;This is a Clear Lie?&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; ... Why did you not say as soon as you heard it: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;It is not for us to speak of it&lt;/span&gt;? God preserve us, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;it is a great Slander!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Purpose of these verses&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; It was not only 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai along with 3 more Sahaba, but almost all the companions were doubting 'Aisha and thus Muhammad's prophethood too indirectly. Thus, Muhammad used these verses in order to rebuke all of them, so that they stop doubting 'Aisha's character and Muhammad's claim of prophethood. But the issue is, inside the home:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Muhammad was himself fully doubtful about 'Aisha,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;and he himself didn't immediately think well of 'Aisha,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;and he himself didn't say: &quot;This is a lie clear&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;And he himself didn't ask for 4 witnesses, but he directly started consultation to divorce 'Aisha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It proves that Muhammad was himself doing exactly the opposite of what the Quran was saying. Or in more simple words, Muhammad declared the revelation of these verses in order to rebuke others, and he thought his own story (i.e. he was himself doubting 'Aisha) would perhaps not come to the light. But 'Aisha indeed told the inside story later too, exposing Muhammad that he was no different than those Sahaba who were doubting 'Aisha's character.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3598db;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Verse 26]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;strong&gt;mpure women are for impure men and impure men for impure women, and pure women are for pure men and pure men for pure women.&lt;/strong&gt; They are free from those scandals which the slanderers utter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Purpose of this verse&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Once more, the author of the Quran (Muhammad himself) employed this as an 'argument' to persuade people to believe in 'Aisha's innocence. However, this Quranic argument is fundamentally flawed and illogical. For example, the Quran itself claims that the wife of Lut was not righteous etc. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId278223&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad '&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;outside&lt;/span&gt;' the house vs. Muhammad '&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;inside&lt;/span&gt;' the house &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us examine Muhammad's conduct outside the house during his first public appearance, which occurred approximately a month later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4757&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4757&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Aisha: ... Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up and addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, he said, &quot;To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'forged story'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; against my wife. By Allah, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do not know anything bad about her&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man (i.e. Safwan) about whom I have &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;never known anything bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus In public:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad &lt;strong&gt;totally denied&lt;/strong&gt; this slander as a &quot;&lt;strong&gt;forged story&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And when he said {By Allah, &lt;strong&gt;I do not know anything bad about her&lt;/strong&gt;}, then he gave the impression that neither he ever doubted 'Aisha, nor he ever doubted Safwan (the man who found 'Aisha) right from the beginning. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad's fortune took a turn for the worse when 'Aisha revealed the complete opposite behaviour of Muhammad during the incident that transpired &quot;inside the house.&quot; It became evident that not only did Muhammad doubt 'Aisha from the beginning, but he continued to harbour doubts until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad doubted 'Aisha's Charter]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: ... &quot;After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers &lt;strong&gt;while I was unaware of anything of all that,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and leave&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad started consulting 'Ali about divorcing 'Aisha]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said) When the Divine Inspiration was delayed, &lt;strong&gt;Allah's Messenger called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me ... &lt;/strong&gt;(Muhammad then also asked Barira, the maid-servant about 'Aisha's charater) and Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[Muhammad kept on doubting 'Aisha till the end ... i.e. even after ony month]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said that she went to her parents' house, while she was disturbed from those rumors and from Muhammad's behavior. Then after one month) Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. &lt;strong&gt;He had never sat with me since that day of the slander.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.&lt;/strong&gt; Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-and so about you; &lt;strong&gt;if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;[It was Muhammad, who probably caused most pain to 'Aisha with his attitude of doubting her]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... ('Aisha further said) Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger .' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, &lt;strong&gt;'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me.&lt;/strong&gt; By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' &lt;strong&gt;Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed;&lt;/strong&gt; ... ('Aisha further said after that immediately revelation started coming to Muhammad and he said to her) 'O `Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger). I replied, &lt;strong&gt;'By Allah, I will not go to him,&lt;/strong&gt; and I praise none but Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, it may not have been in Muhammad's interest to publicly express doubt about 'Aisha to those outside his household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this serves as evidence that Muhammad may have misled people by dismissing the story as &quot;forged&quot; while privately harbouring doubts about 'Aisha's character throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a logical perspective, one questions whether a person who resorts to such deception in pursuit of personal interests can truly be considered a genuine Prophet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId70939&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad continued with his claim of never doubting 'Aisha (but this time with the help of REVELATION)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his initial public appearance, Muhammad presented himself to the people outside of his household as if he had never doubted 'Aisha's character. After one month, he continued with the same strategy, but this time his claim came with the extra help of the revelation. Muhammad was deeply angered by those who continued to believe in the incident, which posed a threat to his claim of prophethood. In order to admonish these individuals, Muhammad claimed the revelation of the following Quranic verses approximately one month later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.12?context=4&quot;&gt;Quran 24:12-16&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did the &lt;strong&gt;faithful&lt;/strong&gt; men and women &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;not (immediately) think well of their people&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. 'Aisha and Safwan)&lt;/strong&gt; when they heard this, and said: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;This is a clear lie?&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; ... Why did you not say as soon as you heard it: &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;It is not for us to speak of it&lt;/span&gt;? God preserve us, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;it is a great slander!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these verses, the Quran put these conditions of faithful men and women i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;thinking well about 'Aisha and Safwan immediately. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Absolutely not speaking of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;and denying it as an obvious falsehood, lie and a slander. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problem occurred when later, 'Aisha also told the story, which happened &lt;strong&gt;inside the house&lt;/strong&gt; during that period, where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;It was also Muhammad himself who neither thought good about 'Aisha,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;nor did he stop speaking about it, but he started consulting others about divorcing 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;nor did Muhammad immediately deny it as an obvious falsehood and a big lie and a slander. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, 'Aisha provides a different perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad began to doubt 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad's kindness towards 'Aisha diminished, even when she was ill. He would only greet her and then leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad initiated investigations into 'Aisha's character, seeking information from Ali, Zayd (the adopted son), and Barira (the maid-servant) within his home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He consulted them about the possibility of divorcing 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even after one month, Muhammad continued to doubt 'Aisha, asking her to confess and repent if she had committed a sin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha expressed deep disappointment with Muhammad's behavior, to the extent that she refused to engage in direct conversation with him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She also refused to testify her innocence to Muhammad, believing that he had already been influenced by planted slander and would not accept her testimony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha further explained that if she were to falsely confess to a sin, Muhammad would readily believe it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha turned her face away from Muhammad and laid on the other side of the bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite Muhammad claiming divine revelation that proved 'Aisha's innocence, she remained upset with his behavior. When her mother asked her to accompany Muhammad, 'Aisha refused to go with him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a logical perspective, it becomes apparent that Muhammad used the revelation to reprimand others for the very actions he himself had committed. In reality, Muhammad's behaviour inflicted the greatest pain on 'Aisha, surpassing the actions of any other individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId877911&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How did Muhammad know Allah would '&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;soon&lt;/span&gt;' reveal the verses of innocence of 'Aisha after one month?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the entire month, there was no revelation affirming 'Aisha's innocence. However, Muhammad visited 'Aisha at her parent's house and assured her that Allah would soon reveal the verses regarding her innocence. Astonishingly, merely a minute later, Muhammad claimed that the revelation had arrived, absolving 'Aisha of all accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of the slander. &lt;strong&gt;A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case&lt;/strong&gt;. Allah's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so and so about you; if you are innocent,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;then soon Allah will reveal your innocence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness&lt;/strong&gt; for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance ... &lt;strong&gt;(Aisha said) 'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, &lt;/strong&gt;and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me ... Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed ... &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, by Allah, before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left his seat&lt;/strong&gt; and before any of the household left,&lt;strong&gt; the Divine inspiration came to Allah's Messenger&lt;/strong&gt; (about my innocence)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Muhammad's ability to claim that a revelation would soon come for 'Aisha's innocence indicates that he had full control over the timing of revelations. It is quite remarkable that the revelation arrived instantly, right after Muhammad and 'Aisha concluded their conversation, just as Muhammad had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This serves as evidence that there is no divine entity, Allah, in the heavens, but rather Muhammad himself was the source of these revelations, creating them at will and on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId182187&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quranic order to lash the eyewitnesses if their number is less than 4 (even if they are telling the truth)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the incident of Ifk, Muhammad asserted the revelation of verse 24 of Surah Nur. This verse introduced a completely novel condition that had no prior or subsequent precedent in the world. It mandated that if the number of witnesses is less than 4, all of them should be subjected to 80 lashes, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;even if their testimony is truthful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.4&quot;&gt;Surah Nur 24:4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses - &lt;strong&gt;lash them with eighty lashes&lt;/strong&gt; and do not accept from them testimony ever after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary motive behind the revelation of this order by the writer of the Quran (Muhammad) can be attributed to the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad aimed to establish &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Abdullah Ibn Ubai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a deterrent example for those who doubted 'Aisha's innocence and, by extension, Muhammad's prophethood. His plan to eliminate 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai as a punishment fell through when he managed to evade it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, Muhammad faced a significant challenge when the Muslim tribe led by 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai openly defied his authority as a prophet, fueling tensions that could potentially escalate into conflict. This situation posed a threat to Muhammad's influence over his followers, thereby necessitating a decisive action to regain control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, even if 'Abdullah Ibn Ubai managed to escape punishment, Muhammad still sought to administer severe penalties to someone else as a means of setting an example for all those who harbored doubts about his prophethood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up on the pulpit and complained about &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; before his companions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and he was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on quietening them till they became silent and so did he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human logic dictates that the Islamic ruling of lashing witnesses, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;even if they are telling the truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, goes against rationality. This illogical directive raises doubts about the divine origin of the revelations and suggests that Muhammad himself may have been fabricating them to suit his political agenda. Such evidence of &quot;human error&quot; undermines the credibility of the revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, many modern Muslim countries have recognized the absurdity of this Quranic ruling and have chosen to abandon it. Today, witnesses in cases of adultery are not subjected to the punishment of 80 lashes, even if their numbers are less than four. This pragmatic approach reflects a departure from the rigid application of an outdated and unreasonable directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId242783&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Quranic claim that Pure Men have only the pure Women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quranic assertion that pure men have only pure women is presented as an argument supporting 'Aisha's innocence, as she was married to a pure man, Muhammad, according to the revelation in Surah Nur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.3?context=24&quot;&gt;Surah Nur 4:3 and 4:26&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist, and that has been made unlawful to the believers ۔۔۔ Women impure are for men impure, and men impure for women impure and women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity: these are not affected by what people say: for them there is forgiveness, and a provision honorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir wrote in his Tafsir under verse 26 of Surah Nur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Evil women are for evil men and evil men are for evil women, and good women are for good men and good men are for good women.&lt;em&gt; This also necessarily refers back to what they said, i.e., &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allah would not have made `A'ishah the wife of His Messenger unless she had been good, because he is the best of the best of mankind. If she had been evil, she would not have been a suitable partner either according to His Laws or His decree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://m.qtafsir.com/Surah-An-Noor/The-Goodness-of-%60Aishah-becau---&quot;&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Nur 24:26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Qur'an itself provides examples that challenge the claim that pure men only have pure women. The story of Lut's wife, who was not pure-hearted despite Lut being a pure man, and the example of Pharaoh's wife, who was considered pure while Pharaoh himself was not, contradict this argument. Additionally, the wife of Noah is also mentioned as not being pure. These examples reveal the flaws in the argument put forth by the Qur'an and Muhammad, indicating the human nature of the revelation and raising doubts about the existence of Allah and the authenticity of Muhammad's claims of being a prophet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId620933&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Role of so-called 'Islamic Modesty' in the incident of Ifk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the so-called 'Islamic Modesty' plays a &lt;strong&gt;negative&lt;/strong&gt; role in this incident too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: ... &lt;strong&gt;I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt)&lt;/strong&gt;. So we went on till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. &lt;strong&gt;(In the meanwhile) the people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it&lt;/strong&gt;...They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of hijab in Islam requires the complete separation of women from unrelated men in society. Even conversations and interactions between men and women are considered inappropriate and contrary to Islamic modesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, during this journey, Aisha was concealed from the view of men behind the curtains of her howdah. Since men and women were not even allowed to greet each other, the men who lifted her howdah couldn't confirm her presence by simply saying hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of these circumstances were severe. Aisha spent the entire month in tears and pain, despite her innocence. Even Muhammad, who harbored no kindness towards her, allowed this slander to affect him, further exacerbating the situation. This division among Muslims led to a dangerous conflict between the two factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Imposing such restrictions in the name of Islamic modesty goes against human nature. These unnatural limitations instill paranoia and skepticism within society, resulting in a disturbed state of mind. Muslims struggle to comprehend why companions like Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah slandered Aisha. However, it seems that these unnatural restrictions have made members of Islamic society so paranoid that they start believing in things that are not actually true. (Note: Muslims still hold high regard for these two companions by using &quot;Radhi Allahu 'Anhu&quot; when referring to them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, thousands of &lt;strong&gt;honor killings&lt;/strong&gt; occur in Islamic societies, based solely on suspicions and paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause of this month-long ordeal was the restriction on interaction between men and women in the name of Islamic modesty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, see this lack of interaction between them when Safwan found 'Asiha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated 'Aisha: ... While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me &lt;strong&gt;as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed)&lt;/strong&gt;. So I woke up when he recited Istirja' (i.e. &quot;Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un&quot;) as soon as he recognized me, &lt;strong&gt;I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word&lt;/strong&gt;, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;How could Islam be considered a 'religion of nature' when it has made it so difficult that even in emergencies, men and women don't even exchange a single word?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;What could have happened if they had greeted each other, and Safwan had asked her about the problem in detail (and perhaps helped her in finding her necklace), why she was alone there, and if she needed some other kind of help too in that situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in present times, Muslim women and girls face difficulty in seeking assistance without hesitation in various fields, whether it be from male doctors, male teachers, or others. The imposition of these unnatural restrictions drains a significant amount of energy from society, rendering half of the Islamic society, namely women, practically useless and unable to contribute to productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId548081&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why did Muhammad use to take his wives during the battles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the pre-Islamic era known as Jahiliyyah in Arabia, kings ruled like dictators. They forbade their common soldiers from bringing their wives along on journeys, yet they themselves indulged in the company of their own wives, despite the added burden it placed on their armies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad, too, followed the practices of these dictatorial kings. The incident of Ifk took place when Muhammad took 'Aisha with him on a particular journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same Hadith regarding the incident of Ifk, 'Aisha narrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-4141/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 4141 (Dar-us-Salam Ref)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots amongst his wives, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to take with him the one on whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the Ghazwat (in which the incident of Ifk happened) which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs unfortunately became scapegoats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This began when the pagans of Mecca presented three questions to Muhammad as a test. However, he was unable to provide answers for the next 15 days. Muhammad then offered an excuse, stating that Gabriel had not visited him with the answers because there was a puppy in his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Syuti documented the following tradition in the commentary on verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;amp;tAyahNo=23&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;18:23 (link)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextResultArabic&quot;&gt;أخرج ابن المنذرعن مجاهد، أن قريشاً اجتمعت فقالوا: &quot; يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، فما هذا الدين الذي جئت به؟ قال: هذا دين جئت به من الرحمن. فقالوا: إنا لا نعرف الرحمن، إلا رحمن اليمامة - يعنون مسيلمة الكذاب - ثم كاتبوا اليهود فقالوا: قد نبغ فينا رجل يزعم أنه نبي، وقد رغب عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، ويزعم أن الذي جاء به من الرحمن. قلنا: لا نعرف الرحمن إلا رحمن اليمامة، وهو أمين لا يخون.. وفيّ لا يغدر.. صدوق لا يكذب، وهو في حسب وثروة من قومه، فاكتبوا إلينا بأشياء نسأله عنها. فاجتمعت يهود فقالوا: إن هذا لوصفه وزمانه الذي يخرج فيه. فكتبوا إلى قريش: أن سلوه عن أمر أصحاب الكهف، وعن ذي القرنين، وعن الروح. فإن يكن الذي أتاكم به من الرحمن، فإن الرحمن هو الله عز وجل، وإن يكن من رحمن اليمامة فينقطع. فلما أتى ذلك قريشاً أتى الظفر في أنفسها فقالوا: يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائك... فحدثنا عن أمر أصحاب الكهف وذي القرنين والروح. قال: ائتوني غداً. ولم يستثن، فمكث جبريل عنه ما شاء الله لا يأتيه، ثم أتاه فقال: سألوني عن أشياء لم يكن عندي بها علم فأجيب حتى شق ذلك عليّ. قال: ألم ترنا لا ندخل بيتاً فيه كلب ولا صورة؟ - وكان في البيت جرو كلب - ونزلت { ولا تقولن لشيء إني فاعل ذلك غداً إلا أن يشاء الله واذكر ربك إذا نسيت وقل عسى أن يهدين ربي لأقرب من هذا رشداً } من علم الذي سألتموني عنه أن يأتي قبل غد؟ ونزل ما ذكر من أصحاب الكهف ونزل&lt;b&gt;{ &lt;span class=&quot;TextAyah&quot;&gt;ويسألونك عن الروح...&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;/b&gt; [الإسراء: 85] الآية &quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextResultArabic&quot;&gt;Ibn Mundhir narrated from Mujahid that the pagans of Quraysh gathered and said to Muhammad, &quot;You have deviated from the religion of our ancestors. Where did you get this new religion from?&quot; Muhammad replied, &quot;This religion is from Rahman (i.e. another name of Allah).&quot; The Quraysh responded, &quot;We only know Rahman  from Yemen.&quot; They associated Musaylmah Kadhab with it, who was another person claiming false prophethood during Muhammad's era and also claimed his new religion was from al-Rahman, i.e., God. Then, the Quraysh wrote to the Jews, informing them that a person had emerged among them claiming to be a prophet, having abandoned the religion of their ancestors ... The Jews replied, &quot;Ask him three questions about the Ashab-e-Kuhf (the People of the Cave), Dhulqarnain, and the spirit. If he can answer these questions, then he is from Rahman, who is God. But if Rahman is from Yemen, he will not be able to answer them.&quot; The Quraysh became pleased with this and said to Muhammad, &quot;If you have already abandoned the religion of our ancestors, then tell us about the Ashab-e-Kuhf, Dhulqarnain, and the spirit.&quot; Muhammad told them, &quot;Come to me tomorrow (and I will answer).&quot; However, Muhammad forgot to say Insha-Allah (i.e., if Allah wills). Gabriel appeared to him after only 15 days. Muhammad said to Gabriel, &quot;The Quraysh came to me and asked me about certain things (as a test of my prophethood), but I didn't know the answers. I was in a very difficult situation during this period.&quot; Gabriel replied, &quot;Have you not seen that we (i.e., the angels) do not enter a house with a dog or a picture? There was a puppy in your house, and you were not aware of it.&quot; Consequently, the following revelation was sent down: &quot;[... and do not say of anything, 'Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,' except (when adding), 'If Allah wills.' Quran 18:22-24]&quot; (i.e., the puppy entered his house while he forgot to say Insha-Allah).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3227&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3227&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Salim's father: Once Gabriel promised the Prophet (that he would visit him, but Gabriel did not come) and later on he said, &quot;We, angels, do not enter a house which contains a picture or a dog.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual situation was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad neither knew the answers to the three questions nor was he in contact with any Allah or angel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, Muhammad began seeking information from others, which took him 15 days to gather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, Muhammad made an excuse that he was unable to answer the questions as he had forgotten to say Insha-Allah (if God wills). And he claimed that a puppy entering his house prevented Gabriel from delivering the answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to question the validity of this excuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad went outside of his house during those 15 days to relieve himself and pray in the mosques. Why didn't Gabriel come to him there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How was it that the purity of a great angel like Gabriel could not overcome the presence of a small puppy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why couldn't the purity of Muhammad himself overcome the impurity of a small puppy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about the two angels, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiraman_Katibin&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kiraman Katibin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who are said to sit on the shoulders of every person, recording their deeds? Are Kiraman Katibin also expelled from the house by dogs, allowing one to commit sins inside without being recorded?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, if dogs are truly considered impure, why did the &quot;people of the cave أصحاب الكهف&quot; take a dog along with them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, it appears that Muhammad used the puppy as a scapegoat for his inability to answer the questions the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So his example is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants. That is the example of the people who denied Our signs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verse compares the actions of those who deny the signs of Allah to the behavior of a dog, stating that if you chase him or leave him, he pants. This analogy raises questions about the connection between panting and accepting or rejecting the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's Allah seemingly did not acknowledge that panting is a natural process for dogs to regulate their body temperature through evaporation, similar to how humans cool down through sweating. However, using panting as a symbol of rejecting the message appears to be an illogical and erroneous comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweating, a natural bodily process in humans, does not imply rejection of a message. Therefore, it is puzzling why the panting of dogs would be attributed to message rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example is highly flawed and does not align with the wisdom one would expect from a divine entity characterized as All-Wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId833021&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Orders of killing all Dogs in Medina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation in Medina after Muhammad's arrival unfolded as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad had already declared dogs to be impure and discouraged their presence as pets inside homes, as it would invalidate prayers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the people of the desert, whose livelihoods revolved around livestock, cherished their dogs, considering them highly valuable. Consequently, there were roaming dogs within the city of Medina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jewish community in Medina was aware of the incident in which Muhammad used the excuse of a puppy in his house to explain the delay in Gabriel's arrival with revelation for 15 days. Simultaneously, they observed that Muslims from the Aus and Khazraj tribes in Medina kept dogs in close proximity to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that Muhammad grew displeased with the behavior of the Aus and Khazraj tribes, who disregarded his explicit orders to remove dogs from their houses. This might have been a motivating factor behind Muhammad eventually issuing a command to kill all dogs in Medina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId567896&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Hints of Human Drama in the Revelations Regarding the Killing of Dogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Evolution of Sharia Ruling on the Killing of Dogs in Four Stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st Stage: Initially, Muhammad commanded the killing of all dogs, regardless of their roles or appearances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd Stage: In response to public outcry against the mass killing of dogs, then Allah (i.e. Muhammad) revised the ruling, allowing people to keep dogs for hunting and livestock protection while maintaining the directive to kill all other dogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd Stage: However, further protests led to another revision, whereby the Divine Allah rescinded the order to kill all other dogs, except those with black coloration. In this stage, black dogs were deemed as associated with devils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4th Stage: Continuing opposition to the killing of black dogs prompted yet another revision. Then Allah (i.e. Muhammad) reversed the ruling once more, abolishing the killing of all black dogs, except for those that were jet-black with two spots on their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout these four stages, the Sharia ruling regarding the killing of dogs underwent transformations due to the protests and concerns raised by the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1572&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1572&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill (all) dogs, and we carried out this order so much so that we also kill the dog coming with a woman from the desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2845&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2845&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Were dogs not a species of creature I should command that they all be killed; but kill every pure black one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:510a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 510a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dharr reported: The Messenger of 'Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguishes it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as you are asking me, and he said: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The black dog is a devil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1572&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1572&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill (all) dogs ... Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) forbade their killing. He (the Prophet further) said: It is your duty (to kill) the jet-black (dog) having&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;two spots (on the eyes), for it is a devil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an Intriguing Contradiction in the Sharia Rulings on Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contradiction becomes apparent when considering that if the devil was not present in dogs other than the jet-black ones with two spots on their eyes, why did Muhammad/Allah initially decree the killing of all other innocent dogs who did not possess any demonic qualities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to remember that a &quot;divine revelation&quot; should not be subject to trial and error but rather should embody the flawless wisdom of an All-Wise God from its very inception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When examining the evolution of Islamic orders regarding alcohol, we observe a progression from leniency to strictness in three stages, reflecting an understanding of human psychology. Initially, praying while intoxicated was prohibited, followed by a complete prohibition of alcohol, and finally, the introduction of 80 lashes as punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the case of dogs follows an opposite trajectory—orders transitioned from strict to lenient. This means that the initial decree to kill all dogs went against human psychology, and subsequent modifications were made due to the protests of people who vehemently opposed the killing of their pet dogs and advocated for the retention of dogs for hunting and guarding purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad/Allah was indeed compelled to change the orders due to the intense opposition and protest from people who were unwilling to part with their beloved canine companions. This sentiment of resistance is evident in the hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1573a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1573a&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Mughaffal reported: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered the killing of dogs and then said: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what is the trouble with them (i.e. Why were the people protesting)? How are dogs a nuisance to them (the citizens of Medina)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; He then permitted the keeping of dogs for hunting and (the protection of) herds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, a divine revelation should be grounded in divine wisdom rather than relying on a trial-and-error approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId213799&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Hints of Human Drama within the Revelations (Part 2: The Influence of Superstitions on Muhammad's Beliefs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In various parts of the world, the belief that encountering a black cat is a sign of bad luck prevails. Muslims, however, reject this notion and often mock Hindus and others who adhere to such superstitions. Look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20121107043021/http://shaheedeislam.com/aap-k-masaul-or-un-ka-hal/ap-k-masail-or-unka-hal-jild-1/1267-toham-parasti&quot;&gt;Fatwa&lt;/a&gt;, where the Mufti is asserting that believing in such superstitions is a sign of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims are justified in their dismissal of this superstition, as there is no inherent malevolence associated with either black cats or their act of crossing paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is noteworthy that Muhammad himself was influenced by superstitions prevalent in the ignorant Arab society of his time. One such superstition pertained to the black ram, which Muhammad adopted due to the customs and beliefs of his society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1967&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a ram with black legs, black belly and black (circles) round the eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; should be brought to him, so that he should sacrifice it. He said to 'A'isha: Give me the large knife, and then said: Sharpen it on a stone. She did that. He then took it (the knife) and then the ram; he placed it on the ground and then sacrificed it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad took the prevailing superstition surrounding the color black a step further by associating it with black dogs, resulting in more severe implications. While other cultures limited their belief in black cats as bad omens, Muhammad declared that black dogs were not only ill-fated signs but considered devils themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Muhammad's teachings, the presence of a black dog could disrupt prayers or even sever the connection to the divine if they were in the vicinity or present within a household. Such beliefs were taken to an extreme extent, with Muhammad advocating for the killing of all black dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By intertwining superstition with his religious teachings, Muhammad reinforced the negative perception of black dogs, exacerbating the superstitions surrounding them and promoting their harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:510a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 510a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of 'Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguish it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as you are asking me, and he said: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The black dog is a devil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/black%20dog.png&quot; alt=&quot;Black dog devil or best &amp;amp; loyal friend&quot; width=&quot;658&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/black dog.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Muslims,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at this black dog, do you perceive it as a devil deserving to be killed? Alternatively, do you recognize it as a loving, caring, and loyal friend to this baby?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to tap into the humanity within you to make a compassionate and informed decision. Trust in your innate sense of compassion, as it will always guide you in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to remember that the historical orders attributed to Muhammad, commanding the killing of all black dogs or black dogs with two spots on their eyes, still exist today. Consider carefully whether you truly believe in implementing such directives in the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let empathy and reason guide your actions, ensuring that you treat all living beings with kindness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId145170&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Questionable Fabrication: Separating the Puppy Excuse from Gabriel's Delay in Muslim Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims claim that the incident of the puppy didn't happen during Muhammad's test in Mecca, but later in Medina. They present the following tradition by 'Aisha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2104a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2104a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A'isha reported that Gabriel (peace be upon him) made a promise with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to come at a definite hour; that hour came but he did not visit him. And there was in his hand (in the hand of Allah's Apostle) a staff. He threw it from his hand and said: Never has Allah or His messengers (angels) ever broken their promise. Then he cast a glance (and by chance) found a puppy under his cot &lt;strong&gt;and said: 'A'isha, when did this dog enter here? She said: By Allah, I don't know &lt;/strong&gt;He then commanded and it was turned out. Then Gabriel came and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: You promised me and I waited for you, but you did not come, whereupon he said: It was the dog in your house which prevented me (to come), for we (angels) do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's explanation that the presence of a puppy prevented Gabriel from visiting him for 15 days appears to be a highly implausible excuse. As a result, it seems that Muslims attempted to disassociate the puppy incident from Muhammad's inability to answer the questions during that time. This intention becomes evident through the creation of fabricated Hadiths aimed at separating the dog's involvement from Muhammad's 15-day struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabrication becomes even more apparent when we examine the &lt;strong&gt;contradictory&lt;/strong&gt; Hadith attributed to 'Aisha herself. I&lt;strong&gt;n this Hadith, she denies witnessing such an incident unfold before her eyes &lt;/strong&gt;(although in the first tradition, she is present on the spot and witnesses the incident directly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises doubts about the authenticity of the accounts that aim to isolate the puppy incident from Gabriel's delay, suggesting a deliberate effort to alter the narrative and mitigate Muhammad's inability to answer the questions during that critical period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2106f&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2106f&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Talha Ansari reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture or portraits. I came to 'A'isha and said to her: This is a news that I have received that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had said: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture or a dog, (and further added)&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;whether she had heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) making a mention of it. She said: No (I did not hear this myself)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;but I narrate to you what I saw him doing. I bear testimony to the fact that he (the Holy Prophet) set out for an expedition. I took a carpet and screened the door with it. When he (the Holy Prophet) came back he saw that carpet and I perceived signs of disapproval on his face. He pulled it until it was torn or it was cut (into pieces) and he said: God has not commanded us to clothe stones and clay. We cut it (the curtain) and prepared two pillowa out of it by stuffing them with the fibre of date-palms and he (the Holy Prophet) did not find fault with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon examining the contradictory traditions present in Sahih Muslim, a clear 180-degree contradiction emerges. This raises several logical possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first tradition could have been fabricated by later Islamic apologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, the second tradition may have been fabricated by later Islamic apologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also plausible that both traditions were fabricated by later Islamic apologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These contradictory traditions strongly suggest that the later Islamic apologists had a motive for concealing or altering certain aspects of the narrative. It is highly probable that their intention was to obscure or downplay Muhammad's excuse of the puppy's presence hindering Gabriel's entry into his house, which ultimately resulted in Muhammad's failure to provide timely answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of these traditions serves as evidence that later Islamic apologists aimed to manipulate the narrative, possibly to shield or downplay Muhammad's shortcomings during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId277709&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2nd Apologetic Excuse: Traditions of Ali and Maimuna also prove that this incident happened in Medina and not in Mecca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam algologists also bring the following 2 traditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ahmad:845&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 845:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;It was narrated that ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I used to come to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) every morning. If he cleared his throat, I would enter, and if he remained silent, I would not enter. He came out to me (on one occasion) and said: “Something happened last night. I heard some movement in the house, then I saw Jibreel (عليه السلام). I said: ‘What prevented you from entering the house?` He said: “In the house there is a dog.` I went in and I saw a puppy belonging to al-Hasan beneath a chair of ours. He [Jibreel] said: “The angels do not enter a house if there are three things in it: a dog or an image or a person who is junub.`&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2105&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2105:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maimuna reported that one morning Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was silent with grief. Maimuna said: Allah's Messenger, I find a change in your mood today. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Gabriel had promised me that he would meet me tonight, but he did not meet me. By Allah, he never broke his promises, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) spent the day in this sad (mood). Then it occurred to him that there had been a puppy under their cot. He commanded and it was turned out. He then took some water in his hand and sprinkled it at that place. When it was evening Gabriel met him and he said to him: you promised me that you would meet me the previous night. He said: Yes, but we do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 2 more Ahadith are not proving the point of view of Islam apologists (i.e. this incident happened in Medina), but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These 2 more Ahadith are also proving the presence of the FABRICATION Factory of Ahadith by Islam apologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only these 2 more Ahadith are &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contradicting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; each other, but they are also contradicting the hadith of 'Aisha too. Logically, this incident can happen with either one of them among 'Aisha, 'Ali and Maimuna. Thus, it is again proof of the fabrication of Ahadith in order to hide the real story. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no limit to the fabrication of Ahadith by Islam apologists. The whole FACTORY was present there for this purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We request the readers to read our 2 articles on Muslims deception of Fabricating Hadiths:&lt;/p&gt;

But later Hadith Fabrication Factory by Islam apologists fabricated 133 traditions (including Sahih Ahadith) in order to counter the first Statement and they claimed it was Ismael who was sacrificed. Through this, they wanted to give preference to Muhammad and his ancestor (Ismael) over Jews and their ancestor Ishaq. &lt;/li&gt;

But all these lies caught red-handed while the Quran itself became a witness that Allah/Muhammad failed to show even a tiniest of any miracle in front of the Meccan Pagans. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unfortunate dogs were unjustly made scapegoats for Muhammad's failure to answer the questions during those 15 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout the 1400 years of Islamic history, they were despised and held responsible for a crime they were not even guilty of. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And perhaps the most unfortunate issue is, still today 1.5 billion people HATE dogs due to Muhammad/Allah. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we were to assume that the incident with the puppy was unrelated to Muhammad's inability to answer the questions, it remains impossible to accept these Sharia Orders as a &quot;divine revelation&quot; from an All-Wise and All-Knowing entity. These orders are characterized by cruelty, superstitions, and a trial-and-error approach that changes multiple times in response to people's anger and protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without the explicit order to kill dogs, Muhammad's claim that black dogs are devils is inherently illogical, contradicting the natural sense of compassion within humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aspects are not indicative of divine revelation but rather reflect the intricate complexities and dynamics of human drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs unfortunately became scapegoats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This began when the pagans of Mecca presented three questions to Muhammad as a test. However, he was unable to provide answers for the next 15 days. Muhammad then offered an excuse, stating that Gabriel had not visited him with the answers because there was a puppy in his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Syuti documented the following tradition in the commentary on verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;amp;tAyahNo=23&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;18:23 (link)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextResultArabic&quot;&gt;أخرج ابن المنذرعن مجاهد، أن قريشاً اجتمعت فقالوا: &quot; يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، فما هذا الدين الذي جئت به؟ قال: هذا دين جئت به من الرحمن. فقالوا: إنا لا نعرف الرحمن، إلا رحمن اليمامة - يعنون مسيلمة الكذاب - ثم كاتبوا اليهود فقالوا: قد نبغ فينا رجل يزعم أنه نبي، وقد رغب عن ديننا ودين آبائنا، ويزعم أن الذي جاء به من الرحمن. قلنا: لا نعرف الرحمن إلا رحمن اليمامة، وهو أمين لا يخون.. وفيّ لا يغدر.. صدوق لا يكذب، وهو في حسب وثروة من قومه، فاكتبوا إلينا بأشياء نسأله عنها. فاجتمعت يهود فقالوا: إن هذا لوصفه وزمانه الذي يخرج فيه. فكتبوا إلى قريش: أن سلوه عن أمر أصحاب الكهف، وعن ذي القرنين، وعن الروح. فإن يكن الذي أتاكم به من الرحمن، فإن الرحمن هو الله عز وجل، وإن يكن من رحمن اليمامة فينقطع. فلما أتى ذلك قريشاً أتى الظفر في أنفسها فقالوا: يا محمد، قد رغبت عن ديننا ودين آبائك... فحدثنا عن أمر أصحاب الكهف وذي القرنين والروح. قال: ائتوني غداً. ولم يستثن، فمكث جبريل عنه ما شاء الله لا يأتيه، ثم أتاه فقال: سألوني عن أشياء لم يكن عندي بها علم فأجيب حتى شق ذلك عليّ. قال: ألم ترنا لا ندخل بيتاً فيه كلب ولا صورة؟ - وكان في البيت جرو كلب - ونزلت { ولا تقولن لشيء إني فاعل ذلك غداً إلا أن يشاء الله واذكر ربك إذا نسيت وقل عسى أن يهدين ربي لأقرب من هذا رشداً } من علم الذي سألتموني عنه أن يأتي قبل غد؟ ونزل ما ذكر من أصحاب الكهف ونزل&lt;b&gt;{ &lt;span class=&quot;TextAyah&quot;&gt;ويسألونك عن الروح...&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;/b&gt; [الإسراء: 85] الآية &quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextResultArabic&quot;&gt;Ibn Mundhir narrated from Mujahid that the pagans of Quraysh gathered and said to Muhammad, &quot;You have deviated from the religion of our ancestors. Where did you get this new religion from?&quot; Muhammad replied, &quot;This religion is from Rahman (i.e. another name of Allah).&quot; The Quraysh responded, &quot;We only know Rahman  from Yemen.&quot; They associated Musaylmah Kadhab with it, who was another person claiming false prophethood during Muhammad's era and also claimed his new religion was from al-Rahman, i.e., God. Then, the Quraysh wrote to the Jews, informing them that a person had emerged among them claiming to be a prophet, having abandoned the religion of their ancestors ... The Jews replied, &quot;Ask him three questions about the Ashab-e-Kuhf (the People of the Cave), Dhulqarnain, and the spirit. If he can answer these questions, then he is from Rahman, who is God. But if Rahman is from Yemen, he will not be able to answer them.&quot; The Quraysh became pleased with this and said to Muhammad, &quot;If you have already abandoned the religion of our ancestors, then tell us about the Ashab-e-Kuhf, Dhulqarnain, and the spirit.&quot; Muhammad told them, &quot;Come to me tomorrow (and I will answer).&quot; However, Muhammad forgot to say Insha-Allah (i.e., if Allah wills). Gabriel appeared to him after only 15 days. Muhammad said to Gabriel, &quot;The Quraysh came to me and asked me about certain things (as a test of my prophethood), but I didn't know the answers. I was in a very difficult situation during this period.&quot; Gabriel replied, &quot;Have you not seen that we (i.e., the angels) do not enter a house with a dog or a picture? There was a puppy in your house, and you were not aware of it.&quot; Consequently, the following revelation was sent down: &quot;[... and do not say of anything, 'Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,' except (when adding), 'If Allah wills.' Quran 18:22-24]&quot; (i.e., the puppy entered his house while he forgot to say Insha-Allah).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3227&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3227&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Salim's father: Once Gabriel promised the Prophet (that he would visit him, but Gabriel did not come) and later on he said, &quot;We, angels, do not enter a house which contains a picture or a dog.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual situation was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad neither knew the answers to the three questions nor was he in contact with any Allah or angel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, Muhammad began seeking information from others, which took him 15 days to gather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, Muhammad made an excuse that he was unable to answer the questions as he had forgotten to say Insha-Allah (if God wills). And he claimed that a puppy entering his house prevented Gabriel from delivering the answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to question the validity of this excuse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad went outside of his house during those 15 days to relieve himself and pray in the mosques. Why didn't Gabriel come to him there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How was it that the purity of a great angel like Gabriel could not overcome the presence of a small puppy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why couldn't the purity of Muhammad himself overcome the impurity of a small puppy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about the two angels, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiraman_Katibin&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kiraman Katibin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who are said to sit on the shoulders of every person, recording their deeds? Are Kiraman Katibin also expelled from the house by dogs, allowing one to commit sins inside without being recorded?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, if dogs are truly considered impure, why did the &quot;people of the cave أصحاب الكهف&quot; take a dog along with them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, it appears that Muhammad used the puppy as a scapegoat for his inability to answer the questions the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId277709&quot;&gt;2nd Apologetic Excuse: Traditions of Ali and Maimuna also prove that this incident happened in Medina and not in Mecca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId692962&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId949643&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad's Allah didn't know about the Panting of dogs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the incident of Muhammad's test, he continued to present dogs in a bad light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.176&quot;&gt;7:176&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So his example is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants. That is the example of the people who denied Our signs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verse compares the actions of those who deny the signs of Allah to the behavior of a dog, stating that if you chase him or leave him, he pants. This analogy raises questions about the connection between panting and accepting or rejecting the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's Allah seemingly did not acknowledge that panting is a natural process for dogs to regulate their body temperature through evaporation, similar to how humans cool down through sweating. However, using panting as a symbol of rejecting the message appears to be an illogical and erroneous comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweating, a natural bodily process in humans, does not imply rejection of a message. Therefore, it is puzzling why the panting of dogs would be attributed to message rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example is highly flawed and does not align with the wisdom one would expect from a divine entity characterized as All-Wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId833021&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Orders of killing all Dogs in Medina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation in Medina after Muhammad's arrival unfolded as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad had already declared dogs to be impure and discouraged their presence as pets inside homes, as it would invalidate prayers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the people of the desert, whose livelihoods revolved around livestock, cherished their dogs, considering them highly valuable. Consequently, there were roaming dogs within the city of Medina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jewish community in Medina was aware of the incident in which Muhammad used the excuse of a puppy in his house to explain the delay in Gabriel's arrival with revelation for 15 days. Simultaneously, they observed that Muslims from the Aus and Khazraj tribes in Medina kept dogs in close proximity to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that Muhammad grew displeased with the behavior of the Aus and Khazraj tribes, who disregarded his explicit orders to remove dogs from their houses. This might have been a motivating factor behind Muhammad eventually issuing a command to kill all dogs in Medina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId567896&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Hints of Human Drama in the Revelations Regarding the Killing of Dogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Evolution of Sharia Ruling on the Killing of Dogs in Four Stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st Stage: Initially, Muhammad commanded the killing of all dogs, regardless of their roles or appearances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd Stage: In response to public outcry against the mass killing of dogs, then Allah (i.e. Muhammad) revised the ruling, allowing people to keep dogs for hunting and livestock protection while maintaining the directive to kill all other dogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd Stage: However, further protests led to another revision, whereby the Divine Allah rescinded the order to kill all other dogs, except those with black coloration. In this stage, black dogs were deemed as associated with devils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4th Stage: Continuing opposition to the killing of black dogs prompted yet another revision. Then Allah (i.e. Muhammad) reversed the ruling once more, abolishing the killing of all black dogs, except for those that were jet-black with two spots on their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout these four stages, the Sharia ruling regarding the killing of dogs underwent transformations due to the protests and concerns raised by the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1572&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1572&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill (all) dogs, and we carried out this order so much so that we also kill the dog coming with a woman from the desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2845&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2845&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Were dogs not a species of creature I should command that they all be killed; but kill every pure black one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:510a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 510a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dharr reported: The Messenger of 'Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguishes it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as you are asking me, and he said: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The black dog is a devil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1572&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1572&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered us to kill (all) dogs ... Then Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) forbade their killing. He (the Prophet further) said: It is your duty (to kill) the jet-black (dog) having&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;two spots (on the eyes), for it is a devil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an Intriguing Contradiction in the Sharia Rulings on Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contradiction becomes apparent when considering that if the devil was not present in dogs other than the jet-black ones with two spots on their eyes, why did Muhammad/Allah initially decree the killing of all other innocent dogs who did not possess any demonic qualities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to remember that a &quot;divine revelation&quot; should not be subject to trial and error but rather should embody the flawless wisdom of an All-Wise God from its very inception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When examining the evolution of Islamic orders regarding alcohol, we observe a progression from leniency to strictness in three stages, reflecting an understanding of human psychology. Initially, praying while intoxicated was prohibited, followed by a complete prohibition of alcohol, and finally, the introduction of 80 lashes as punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the case of dogs follows an opposite trajectory—orders transitioned from strict to lenient. This means that the initial decree to kill all dogs went against human psychology, and subsequent modifications were made due to the protests of people who vehemently opposed the killing of their pet dogs and advocated for the retention of dogs for hunting and guarding purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad/Allah was indeed compelled to change the orders due to the intense opposition and protest from people who were unwilling to part with their beloved canine companions. This sentiment of resistance is evident in the hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1573a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1573a&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Mughaffal reported: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered the killing of dogs and then said: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what is the trouble with them (i.e. Why were the people protesting)? How are dogs a nuisance to them (the citizens of Medina)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; He then permitted the keeping of dogs for hunting and (the protection of) herds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, a divine revelation should be grounded in divine wisdom rather than relying on a trial-and-error approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId213799&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Hints of Human Drama within the Revelations (Part 2: The Influence of Superstitions on Muhammad's Beliefs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In various parts of the world, the belief that encountering a black cat is a sign of bad luck prevails. Muslims, however, reject this notion and often mock Hindus and others who adhere to such superstitions. Look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20121107043021/http://shaheedeislam.com/aap-k-masaul-or-un-ka-hal/ap-k-masail-or-unka-hal-jild-1/1267-toham-parasti&quot;&gt;Fatwa&lt;/a&gt;, where the Mufti is asserting that believing in such superstitions is a sign of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims are justified in their dismissal of this superstition, as there is no inherent malevolence associated with either black cats or their act of crossing paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is noteworthy that Muhammad himself was influenced by superstitions prevalent in the ignorant Arab society of his time. One such superstition pertained to the black ram, which Muhammad adopted due to the customs and beliefs of his society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1967&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) commanded that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a ram with black legs, black belly and black (circles) round the eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; should be brought to him, so that he should sacrifice it. He said to 'A'isha: Give me the large knife, and then said: Sharpen it on a stone. She did that. He then took it (the knife) and then the ram; he placed it on the ground and then sacrificed it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad took the prevailing superstition surrounding the color black a step further by associating it with black dogs, resulting in more severe implications. While other cultures limited their belief in black cats as bad omens, Muhammad declared that black dogs were not only ill-fated signs but considered devils themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Muhammad's teachings, the presence of a black dog could disrupt prayers or even sever the connection to the divine if they were in the vicinity or present within a household. Such beliefs were taken to an extreme extent, with Muhammad advocating for the killing of all black dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By intertwining superstition with his religious teachings, Muhammad reinforced the negative perception of black dogs, exacerbating the superstitions surrounding them and promoting their harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:510a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 510a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of 'Allah (ﷺ) said: When any one of you stands for prayer and there is a thing before him equal to the back of the saddle that covers him and in case there is not before him (a thing) equal to the back of the saddle, his prayer would be cut off by (passing of an) ass, woman, and black Dog. I said: O Abu Dharr, what feature is there in a black dog which distinguish it from the red dog and the yellow dog? He said: O, son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) as you are asking me, and he said: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The black dog is a devil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/black%20dog.png&quot; alt=&quot;Black dog devil or best &amp;amp; loyal friend&quot; width=&quot;658&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/black dog.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Muslims,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at this black dog, do you perceive it as a devil deserving to be killed? Alternatively, do you recognize it as a loving, caring, and loyal friend to this baby?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to tap into the humanity within you to make a compassionate and informed decision. Trust in your innate sense of compassion, as it will always guide you in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to remember that the historical orders attributed to Muhammad, commanding the killing of all black dogs or black dogs with two spots on their eyes, still exist today. Consider carefully whether you truly believe in implementing such directives in the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let empathy and reason guide your actions, ensuring that you treat all living beings with kindness and respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId145170&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Questionable Fabrication: Separating the Puppy Excuse from Gabriel's Delay in Muslim Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims claim that the incident of the puppy didn't happen during Muhammad's test in Mecca, but later in Medina. They present the following tradition by 'Aisha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2104a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2104a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A'isha reported that Gabriel (peace be upon him) made a promise with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to come at a definite hour; that hour came but he did not visit him. And there was in his hand (in the hand of Allah's Apostle) a staff. He threw it from his hand and said: Never has Allah or His messengers (angels) ever broken their promise. Then he cast a glance (and by chance) found a puppy under his cot &lt;strong&gt;and said: 'A'isha, when did this dog enter here? She said: By Allah, I don't know &lt;/strong&gt;He then commanded and it was turned out. Then Gabriel came and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him: You promised me and I waited for you, but you did not come, whereupon he said: It was the dog in your house which prevented me (to come), for we (angels) do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's explanation that the presence of a puppy prevented Gabriel from visiting him for 15 days appears to be a highly implausible excuse. As a result, it seems that Muslims attempted to disassociate the puppy incident from Muhammad's inability to answer the questions during that time. This intention becomes evident through the creation of fabricated Hadiths aimed at separating the dog's involvement from Muhammad's 15-day struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabrication becomes even more apparent when we examine the &lt;strong&gt;contradictory&lt;/strong&gt; Hadith attributed to 'Aisha herself. I&lt;strong&gt;n this Hadith, she denies witnessing such an incident unfold before her eyes &lt;/strong&gt;(although in the first tradition, she is present on the spot and witnesses the incident directly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises doubts about the authenticity of the accounts that aim to isolate the puppy incident from Gabriel's delay, suggesting a deliberate effort to alter the narrative and mitigate Muhammad's inability to answer the questions during that critical period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2106f&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2106f&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Talha Ansari reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture or portraits. I came to 'A'isha and said to her: This is a news that I have received that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had said: Angels do not enter the house in which there is a picture or a dog, (and further added)&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;whether she had heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) making a mention of it. She said: No (I did not hear this myself)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;but I narrate to you what I saw him doing. I bear testimony to the fact that he (the Holy Prophet) set out for an expedition. I took a carpet and screened the door with it. When he (the Holy Prophet) came back he saw that carpet and I perceived signs of disapproval on his face. He pulled it until it was torn or it was cut (into pieces) and he said: God has not commanded us to clothe stones and clay. We cut it (the curtain) and prepared two pillowa out of it by stuffing them with the fibre of date-palms and he (the Holy Prophet) did not find fault with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon examining the contradictory traditions present in Sahih Muslim, a clear 180-degree contradiction emerges. This raises several logical possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first tradition could have been fabricated by later Islamic apologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, the second tradition may have been fabricated by later Islamic apologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also plausible that both traditions were fabricated by later Islamic apologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These contradictory traditions strongly suggest that the later Islamic apologists had a motive for concealing or altering certain aspects of the narrative. It is highly probable that their intention was to obscure or downplay Muhammad's excuse of the puppy's presence hindering Gabriel's entry into his house, which ultimately resulted in Muhammad's failure to provide timely answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of these traditions serves as evidence that later Islamic apologists aimed to manipulate the narrative, possibly to shield or downplay Muhammad's shortcomings during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId277709&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2nd Apologetic Excuse: Traditions of Ali and Maimuna also prove that this incident happened in Medina and not in Mecca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam algologists also bring the following 2 traditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ahmad:845&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 845:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;It was narrated that ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I used to come to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) every morning. If he cleared his throat, I would enter, and if he remained silent, I would not enter. He came out to me (on one occasion) and said: “Something happened last night. I heard some movement in the house, then I saw Jibreel (عليه السلام). I said: ‘What prevented you from entering the house?` He said: “In the house there is a dog.` I went in and I saw a puppy belonging to al-Hasan beneath a chair of ours. He [Jibreel] said: “The angels do not enter a house if there are three things in it: a dog or an image or a person who is junub.`&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2105&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2105:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maimuna reported that one morning Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was silent with grief. Maimuna said: Allah's Messenger, I find a change in your mood today. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Gabriel had promised me that he would meet me tonight, but he did not meet me. By Allah, he never broke his promises, and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) spent the day in this sad (mood). Then it occurred to him that there had been a puppy under their cot. He commanded and it was turned out. He then took some water in his hand and sprinkled it at that place. When it was evening Gabriel met him and he said to him: you promised me that you would meet me the previous night. He said: Yes, but we do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 2 more Ahadith are not proving the point of view of Islam apologists (i.e. this incident happened in Medina), but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These 2 more Ahadith are also proving the presence of the FABRICATION Factory of Ahadith by Islam apologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only these 2 more Ahadith are &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contradicting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; each other, but they are also contradicting the hadith of 'Aisha too. Logically, this incident can happen with either one of them among 'Aisha, 'Ali and Maimuna. Thus, it is again proof of the fabrication of Ahadith in order to hide the real story. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no limit to the fabrication of Ahadith by Islam apologists. The whole FACTORY was present there for this purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We request the readers to read our 2 articles on Muslims deception of Fabricating Hadiths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=114&amp;amp;catid=26&quot;&gt;The Hadith Fabrication Factory in order to save the honour of Islam&lt;/a&gt;: There were 131 traditions (including Sahih Ahadith), which were present in Hadith books, which claimed Ishaq was the son who was sacrificed. But later Hadith Fabrication Factory by Islam apologists fabricated 133 traditions (including Sahih Ahadith) in order to counter the first Statement and they claimed it was Ismael who was sacrificed. Through this, they wanted to give preference to Muhammad and his ancestor (Ismael) over Jews and their ancestor Ishaq. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=295&amp;amp;catid=41&quot;&gt;The Lie of Moon Splitting: Ample Proof that Hadiths Cannot Be Trusted&lt;/a&gt;: There are many of so-called Sahih Hadiths which claim that Muhammad split the moon into two in front of the Meccan Pagans. But all these lies caught red-handed while the Quran itself became a witness that Allah/Muhammad failed to show even a tiniest of any miracle in front of the Meccan Pagans. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId692962&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unfortunate dogs were unjustly made scapegoats for Muhammad's failure to answer the questions during those 15 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout the 1400 years of Islamic history, they were despised and held responsible for a crime they were not even guilty of. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And perhaps the most unfortunate issue is, still today 1.5 billion people HATE dogs due to Muhammad/Allah. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we were to assume that the incident with the puppy was unrelated to Muhammad's inability to answer the questions, it remains impossible to accept these Sharia Orders as a &quot;divine revelation&quot; from an All-Wise and All-Knowing entity. These orders are characterized by cruelty, superstitions, and a trial-and-error approach that changes multiple times in response to people's anger and protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without the explicit order to kill dogs, Muhammad's claim that black dogs are devils is inherently illogical, contradicting the natural sense of compassion within humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aspects are not indicative of divine revelation but rather reflect the intricate complexities and dynamics of human drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the death of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Khadijah%20bint%20Khuwaylid&quot; rel=&quot;mw:WikiLink&quot; data-ve-attributes=&quot;{&amp;quot;rel&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;mw:WikiLink&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;Khadijah&lt;/a&gt;, Muhammad had about 16 (+/-) wives and slave women, but he got no children from any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2771&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2771&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anas reported that a person (a Coptic slave whose name was &quot;Mabur&quot; and he was the cousin of Maria al-Qibtiyya) was charged with fornication with the slave girl of Allah's Messenger (i.e. Maria al-Qibtiyya). Thereupon Allah's Messenger said to 'Ali: Go and strike his neck. 'Ali came to him and he found him in a well making his body cool. 'Ali said to him: Come out, and as he took hold of his hand and brought him out, he found that his sexual organ had been cut. Hadrat 'Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah's Apostle and said: Allah's Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Hakim recorded the following tradition in his book al-Mustadrak (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211010105134/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=74&amp;amp;ID=6740&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;«عن عايشة قالت : اهديت مارية إلى رسول اللّه ومعها ابن عم لها . قالت : فوقع عليها وقعة فاستمرت حاملا . قالت : فعز لها عند ابن عمها . قالت : فقال اهل الافك والزور : «من حاجته إلى الولد ادعى ولد غيره» وكانت امّه قليلة اللبن فابتاعت له ضائنة لبون فكان يغذى بلبنها فحسن عليه لحمه . قالت عايشة : فدخل به علىّ النبى صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم ذات يوم فقال : «كيف ترين»؟ فقلت : من غذى بلحم الضأن يحسن لحمه . قال : «ولا الشبه» قالت : فحملنى ما يحمل النساء من الغيرة أن قلت : ما أرى شبها . قالت : وبلغ رسول اللّه ما يقول الناس فقال لعلى ... ».&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Aisha said: &quot; Maria&quot; was presented to the prophet of Islam (as a slave woman) and her cousin (a coptic male slave) was with her. After a while Maria became pregnant. Upon that, the people started slandering that since he [the prophet of Islam] needed child, he related the son of that slave-man to himself. Since Maria, as a mother, didn’t have enough breast milk, they fed him by sheep 's milk that’s why he (the son Ibrahim) was fat. 'Aisha said: Once the prophet brought him to me and asked what I thought about him, I replied, &quot;everyone fed by sheep 's milk will get fat.&quot; The holy prophet said doesn’t he look like me?&lt;strong&gt; Aisha said, &quot;I jealously said &quot;No&quot;.&quot; and then the prophet heard of the untrue accusations of people toward Maria. Upon that the prophet sent Ali to kill her cousin&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. the Coptic slave) ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, when it comes to Muhammad's personal life, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad did not give the Coptic slave a chance to have a fair trial in court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He didn’t ask the people (who accused that Coptic slave) to bring the 4 witnesses for fornication. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, all the companions who falsely accused the slave and Mariyah of fornication should have received 80 lashes, as per the Islamic punishment of &quot;حد القذف.&quot; Their testimonies should have been invalidated in court from that point onward. This aligns with Muhammad's own actions during the incident of Ifk involving 'Aisha, where he lashed all the Sahaba who made false accusations of fornication against her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Islamic law, the prescribed punishment for fornication in the case of slaves is 50 lashes. However, Muhammad deviated from Sharia and ordered the direct execution of the slave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that Muslims claim Muhammad to be the epitome of exemplary behavior, shouldn't the best example adhere to the established rules so that people can follow suit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of why honor killings still occur in Muslim countries. If the leader himself did not adhere to the rules, it is likely that the followers would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Muslims have tried to justify this by suggesting that Muhammad may have been aware that he lacked a sexual organ. However, even if we assume this to be true, he would have had two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, if he had prior knowledge of his condition, he should have taken no action against the Coptic slave, as he would have known the individual was innocent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, if he still wished to take action despite being aware of the reality, he should have followed the proper legal procedures and initiated a court trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, Muhammad was not only accusing the Coptic slave of fornication but indirectly accusing Mariyah as well. Even after Ali informed Muhammad that the Coptic slave was without a sex organ, Muhammad continued to doubt Mariyah's fidelity and questioned the parentage of Ibrahim. Ultimately, Jibrael had to intervene and confirm that Ibrahim was indeed Muhammad's son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir recorded the following tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://al-hakawati.net/Books/BookDetails/7518/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B3--%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87-%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن أنس قال‏:‏ لما ولدت مارية إبراهيم كاد أن يقع في النَّبيّ صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم منه شيء حتَّى نزل جبريل عليه السلام فقال‏:‏ ‏(‏‏(‏السلام عليك يا أبا إبراهيم‏)‏‏)‏‏.&lt;br&gt;Anas said, when Ibrahim was born to Maria, then Muhammad became doubtful if Ibrahim was really his son or not. Upon that angel Jibrael came to him and said: Peace be upon you, O the Father of Ibrahim (i.e. confirmed to him that Ibrahim was indeed his son). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, there exists absolutely no Jibrael, and Muhammad had to use the name of revelation and Jibrael in order to keep the Sahaba quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this tradition is also proof that Muhammad didn't know previously if the Coptic slave had a sexual organ or not, while he kept on doubting Mariyah even after Ali told him that the Coptic slave didn't fornicate with Mariya due to his inability. Therefore, the prime suspect in the eyes of Muhammad was Mariyah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rumours continued till the time of the death of Ibrahim. Thus, on his death, Muhammad was unintentionally claiming that Ibrahim was indeed his son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2316&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;فلما توفى إبراهيم قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ان إبراهيم ابني وانه مات في الثدي وان له لظئرين تكملان رضاعه في الجنة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;...  &lt;strong&gt;Ibrahim is (indeed) my son&lt;/strong&gt; and he dies as a suckling babe. He now has two foster-mothers who would complete his suckling period in Paradise.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;There were doubts surrounding Muhammad's fertility, especially considering that according to Muslim scholars, he married Khadija, who was 40 years old at the time. It is widely accepted that all of Muhammad's children, except Ibrahim, were born from his marriage to Khadija. This raises the question of how he had only one child from numerous young women but had six children with one older woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honour Killings in Islamic Countries: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This is truly one of the WEAKEST aspects of Islam. In Islamic countries, killings in the name of &quot;Ghairah&quot; (honour) occur without requiring courts or witnesses. The roots of such killings can be traced back to this incident involving Muhammad, where he ordered the killing of the Coptic slave without any witnesses or trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Muslim Excuse: This was the punishment for Insulting Muhammad for &quot;Entering his private chamber&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Islam apologist wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islam.stackexchange.com/questions/62501/did-prophet-muhammad-peace-be-upon-him-order-killing-of-the-person-who-was-acc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual wording of the hadith says أم ولد which means that it refers to Mariyah al-Qibtiyyah, the mother of the Prophet's son Ibrahim. The accused was a person who had accompanied her from Egypt, sometimes claimed to be her cousin. He would visit her too often and people speculated that he was attracted to her and had relations with her. It is inferable that he persisted even though he knew of the rumors about him and had previously been warned about his inappropriate behavior ... Entering in the private chamber of the Prophet's Umm al-Walad and being alone with her repeatedly would be basis enough for a Ta'zir punishment and that much would have been proven through the reports of witnesses who had informed the Prophet in the first place. &lt;strong&gt;Insult to the prophet is punishable by death&lt;/strong&gt; ... The evidence criterion for Insult and Ta'zir is different from that of fornication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Islam apologists are true that it was the Ta'zir punishment for insulting Muhammad by entering his chamber (and not fornication),&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; why then Ali didn't kill him for this insult in the end? &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;His so-called crime of insulting Muhammad by entering the Chamber of Muhammad despite so-called warnings didn't end with him not having the sexual organ. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving no punishment to that slave person is proof enough that it had nothing to do with the so-called accusation of &quot;insult&quot; by the Islam apologists, but it had to do with the accusation of fornication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is apparent that the notion of a &quot;previous warning&quot; against the slave is simply fabricated by the Islam apologists themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, these Islam apologists don't realize that by claiming that that slave man used to enter in the chamber with Mariyah al-Qubtiyya, they are in fact insulting their Prophet themselves by accusing him of indecent behaviour, where he let that person visit Mariyah and didn't stop him, or to Mariyah to meet each other in his chamber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if they were really meeting each other in his chamber, then it was the duty of Muhammad and he should have forbidden him from visiting her. And if they claim prophet Muhammad didn't stop them from meeting each other in his chamber while Mariyah was a slave, then how come that became an act of insult to Muhammad in the case of that slave man? After all, then it is Halal in Sharia to meet the slave girls of other men in the chambers and Muhammad didn't stop him to visit Mariyah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the story of the lamb and the wolf, where the cunning wolf wanted to eat the lamb by making false accusations against him? The wolf initially blamed the lamb for dirtying his drinking water, even though the water was flowing from the wolf to the lamb. Then the wolf made the next accusation that the lamb had abused him last year, even though the lamb was not yet born. Finally, the wolf came up with the accusation that it was the lamb's father who had abused him last year, using it as an excuse to eat the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Islamic apologists are similar to that cunning wolf, making false accusations repeatedly against the innocent in order to further their own sinister agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;A slave-girl belonging to the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) committed fornication. He (the Prophet) said: Rush up, Ali, and inflict the prescribed punishment on her. I then hurried up, and saw that blood was flowing from her, and did not stop. So I came to him and he said: Have you finished inflicting (punishment on her)? I said: I went to her while her blood was flowing. He said: Leave her alone till her bleeding stops; then inflict the prescribed punishment on her. And inflict the prescribed punishment on those whom your right hands possess (i.e. slaves).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dawud said: A similar tradition has been transmitted by Abu al-Ahwas from 'Abd al-A'la, and also by Shu'bah from 'Abd al-A'la. This version has: He said: Do not give her beating until she gives birth to a child. But the former (version) is sounder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2771&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2771&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anas reported that a person (a Coptic slave whose name was &quot;Mabur&quot; and he was the cousin of Maria al-Qibtiyya) was charged with fornication with the slave girl of Allah's Messenger (i.e. Maria al-Qibtiyya). Thereupon Allah's Messenger said to 'Ali: Go and strike his neck. 'Ali came to him and he found him in a well making his body cool. 'Ali said to him: Come out, and as he took hold of his hand and brought him out, he found that his sexual organ had been cut. Hadrat 'Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah's Apostle and said: Allah's Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Hakim recorded the following tradition in his book al-Mustadrak (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20211010105134/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=74&amp;amp;ID=6740&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;«عن عايشة قالت : اهديت مارية إلى رسول اللّه ومعها ابن عم لها . قالت : فوقع عليها وقعة فاستمرت حاملا . قالت : فعز لها عند ابن عمها . قالت : فقال اهل الافك والزور : «من حاجته إلى الولد ادعى ولد غيره» وكانت امّه قليلة اللبن فابتاعت له ضائنة لبون فكان يغذى بلبنها فحسن عليه لحمه . قالت عايشة : فدخل به علىّ النبى صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم ذات يوم فقال : «كيف ترين»؟ فقلت : من غذى بلحم الضأن يحسن لحمه . قال : «ولا الشبه» قالت : فحملنى ما يحمل النساء من الغيرة أن قلت : ما أرى شبها . قالت : وبلغ رسول اللّه ما يقول الناس فقال لعلى ... ».&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Aisha said: &quot; Maria&quot; was presented to the prophet of Islam (as a slave woman) and her cousin (a coptic male slave) was with her. After a while Maria became pregnant. Upon that, the people started slandering that since he [the prophet of Islam] needed child, he related the son of that slave-man to himself. Since Maria, as a mother, didn’t have enough breast milk, they fed him by sheep 's milk that’s why he (the son Ibrahim) was fat. 'Aisha said: Once the prophet brought him to me and asked what I thought about him, I replied, &quot;everyone fed by sheep 's milk will get fat.&quot; The holy prophet said doesn’t he look like me?&lt;strong&gt; Aisha said, &quot;I jealously said &quot;No&quot;.&quot; and then the prophet heard of the untrue accusations of people toward Maria. Upon that the prophet sent Ali to kill her cousin&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. the Coptic slave) ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, when it comes to Muhammad's personal life, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad did not give the Coptic slave a chance to have a fair trial in court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He didn’t ask the people (who accused that Coptic slave) to bring the 4 witnesses for fornication. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, all the companions who falsely accused the slave and Mariyah of fornication should have received 80 lashes, as per the Islamic punishment of &quot;حد القذف.&quot; Their testimonies should have been invalidated in court from that point onward. This aligns with Muhammad's own actions during the incident of Ifk involving 'Aisha, where he lashed all the Sahaba who made false accusations of fornication against her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Islamic law, the prescribed punishment for fornication in the case of slaves is 50 lashes. However, Muhammad deviated from Sharia and ordered the direct execution of the slave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that Muslims claim Muhammad to be the epitome of exemplary behavior, shouldn't the best example adhere to the established rules so that people can follow suit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of why honor killings still occur in Muslim countries. If the leader himself did not adhere to the rules, it is likely that the followers would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Muslims have tried to justify this by suggesting that Muhammad may have been aware that he lacked a sexual organ. However, even if we assume this to be true, he would have had two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, if he had prior knowledge of his condition, he should have taken no action against the Coptic slave, as he would have known the individual was innocent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, if he still wished to take action despite being aware of the reality, he should have followed the proper legal procedures and initiated a court trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, Muhammad was not only accusing the Coptic slave of fornication but indirectly accusing Mariyah as well. Even after Ali informed Muhammad that the Coptic slave was without a sex organ, Muhammad continued to doubt Mariyah's fidelity and questioned the parentage of Ibrahim. Ultimately, Jibrael had to intervene and confirm that Ibrahim was indeed Muhammad's son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir recorded the following tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://al-hakawati.net/Books/BookDetails/7518/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B3--%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87-%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن أنس قال‏:‏ لما ولدت مارية إبراهيم كاد أن يقع في النَّبيّ صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم منه شيء حتَّى نزل جبريل عليه السلام فقال‏:‏ ‏(‏‏(‏السلام عليك يا أبا إبراهيم‏)‏‏)‏‏.&lt;br&gt;Anas said, when Ibrahim was born to Maria, then Muhammad became doubtful if Ibrahim was really his son or not. Upon that angel Jibrael came to him and said: Peace be upon you, O the Father of Ibrahim (i.e. confirmed to him that Ibrahim was indeed his son). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, there exists absolutely no Jibrael, and Muhammad had to use the name of revelation and Jibrael in order to keep the Sahaba quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this tradition is also proof that Muhammad didn't know previously if the Coptic slave had a sexual organ or not, while he kept on doubting Mariyah even after Ali told him that the Coptic slave didn't fornicate with Mariya due to his inability. Therefore, the prime suspect in the eyes of Muhammad was Mariyah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rumours continued till the time of the death of Ibrahim. Thus, on his death, Muhammad was unintentionally claiming that Ibrahim was indeed his son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2316&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;فلما توفى إبراهيم قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ان إبراهيم ابني وانه مات في الثدي وان له لظئرين تكملان رضاعه في الجنة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;...  &lt;strong&gt;Ibrahim is (indeed) my son&lt;/strong&gt; and he dies as a suckling babe. He now has two foster-mothers who would complete his suckling period in Paradise.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;There were doubts surrounding Muhammad's fertility, especially considering that according to Muslim scholars, he married Khadija, who was 40 years old at the time. It is widely accepted that all of Muhammad's children, except Ibrahim, were born from his marriage to Khadija. This raises the question of how he had only one child from numerous young women but had six children with one older woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honour Killings in Islamic Countries: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;arabi&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This is truly one of the WEAKEST aspects of Islam. In Islamic countries, killings in the name of &quot;Ghairah&quot; (honour) occur without requiring courts or witnesses. The roots of such killings can be traced back to this incident involving Muhammad, where he ordered the killing of the Coptic slave without any witnesses or trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Muslim Excuse: This was the punishment for Insulting Muhammad for &quot;Entering his private chamber&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Islam apologist wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islam.stackexchange.com/questions/62501/did-prophet-muhammad-peace-be-upon-him-order-killing-of-the-person-who-was-acc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual wording of the hadith says أم ولد which means that it refers to Mariyah al-Qibtiyyah, the mother of the Prophet's son Ibrahim. The accused was a person who had accompanied her from Egypt, sometimes claimed to be her cousin. He would visit her too often and people speculated that he was attracted to her and had relations with her. It is inferable that he persisted even though he knew of the rumors about him and had previously been warned about his inappropriate behavior ... Entering in the private chamber of the Prophet's Umm al-Walad and being alone with her repeatedly would be basis enough for a Ta'zir punishment and that much would have been proven through the reports of witnesses who had informed the Prophet in the first place. &lt;strong&gt;Insult to the prophet is punishable by death&lt;/strong&gt; ... The evidence criterion for Insult and Ta'zir is different from that of fornication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Islam apologists are true that it was the Ta'zir punishment for insulting Muhammad by entering his chamber (and not fornication),&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; why then Ali didn't kill him for this insult in the end? &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;His so-called crime of insulting Muhammad by entering the Chamber of Muhammad despite so-called warnings didn't end with him not having the sexual organ. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving no punishment to that slave person is proof enough that it had nothing to do with the so-called accusation of &quot;insult&quot; by the Islam apologists, but it had to do with the accusation of fornication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is apparent that the notion of a &quot;previous warning&quot; against the slave is simply fabricated by the Islam apologists themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, these Islam apologists don't realize that by claiming that that slave man used to enter in the chamber with Mariyah al-Qubtiyya, they are in fact insulting their Prophet themselves by accusing him of indecent behaviour, where he let that person visit Mariyah and didn't stop him, or to Mariyah to meet each other in his chamber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if they were really meeting each other in his chamber, then it was the duty of Muhammad and he should have forbidden him from visiting her. And if they claim prophet Muhammad didn't stop them from meeting each other in his chamber while Mariyah was a slave, then how come that became an act of insult to Muhammad in the case of that slave man? After all, then it is Halal in Sharia to meet the slave girls of other men in the chambers and Muhammad didn't stop him to visit Mariyah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the story of the lamb and the wolf, where the cunning wolf wanted to eat the lamb by making false accusations against him? The wolf initially blamed the lamb for dirtying his drinking water, even though the water was flowing from the wolf to the lamb. Then the wolf made the next accusation that the lamb had abused him last year, even though the lamb was not yet born. Finally, the wolf came up with the accusation that it was the lamb's father who had abused him last year, using it as an excuse to eat the lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Islamic apologists are similar to that cunning wolf, making false accusations repeatedly against the innocent in order to further their own sinister agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4473&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, 4473&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;A slave-girl belonging to the house of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) committed fornication. He (the Prophet) said: Rush up, Ali, and inflict the prescribed punishment on her. I then hurried up, and saw that blood was flowing from her, and did not stop. So I came to him and he said: Have you finished inflicting (punishment on her)? I said: I went to her while her blood was flowing. He said: Leave her alone till her bleeding stops; then inflict the prescribed punishment on her. And inflict the prescribed punishment on those whom your right hands possess (i.e. slaves).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dawud said: A similar tradition has been transmitted by Abu al-Ahwas from 'Abd al-A'la, and also by Shu'bah from 'Abd al-A'la. This version has: He said: Do not give her beating until she gives birth to a child. But the former (version) is sounder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Sayyad was a 13 years old boy, who also claimed prophethood, just like Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While his claim of prophethood could have decreased the market value of Muhammad’s own claim of prophethood, thus Muhammad immediately declared him to be the ‘Dajjal’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, people became confused at that and some of them started doubting Muhammad. It was due to the reason that Muhammad had already told them the clear sins of ‘Dajjal’. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dajjal is blind in the right eye and his eye looks like a bulging out grape (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3439&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukahri, 3439&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the word KAFIR is written between his two eyes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2930a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2930a&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dajjal cannot enter in Medina (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7125&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 7125&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, Muhammad told tons of signs of Dajjal, but none of them fit Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Muhammad realized his mistake, he immediately retreated, and took a new position that he was only ‘&lt;b&gt;Doubtful&lt;/b&gt;’ if Ibn Sayyad was Dajjal or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It exposes the '&lt;strong&gt;Human Errors&lt;/strong&gt;' in the so-called '&lt;strong&gt;Divine Revelation&lt;/strong&gt;' which ultimately means that there is no Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelations on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very unfortunate that 99% of people (including Muslims) don’t know about this incident, although this incident of Ibn Sayyad is as important as the incident of ‘Satanic Verses’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help to spread this information among the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Sayyad was also known as Ibn Sa’id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId104130&quot;&gt;Muhammad found himself in the position of having to protect Ibn Sayyad from being killed due to a grave error on his part&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId789457&quot;&gt;First Issue: Why was it of no use to kill Ibn Sayyad if he was not the Dajjal?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId946010&quot;&gt;Second Issue: Why did Muhammad not receive any revelation specifically addressing Ibn Sayyad's identity as the Dajjal?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId212962&quot;&gt;Third Issue: Muhammad was himself unable to get &quot;revelation&quot; if Ibn Sayyad was the Dajjal or not, but demanded Ibn Sayyad to IMMEDIATELY (on the spot) show a miracle through &quot;revelation&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId840076&quot;&gt;Muhammad himself failed to show a miracle through &quot;revelation&quot; on the spot in front of the Meccans &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId813112&quot;&gt;Muhammad also failed in front of Jews of showing any miracle through &quot;revelation&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId547905&quot;&gt;Some more traditions about Ibn Sayyad:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId508853&quot;&gt;A Fantasy story of Tamim Dari (a Sahabi) meeting with Dajjal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId463147&quot;&gt;Excuse by Islam apologists: Ibn Sayyad was not the Dajjal, but Satan himself &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId524817&quot;&gt;Islam Apologists: Ibn Sayyad was a Jewish Conspiracy against Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId104130&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad found himself in the position of having to protect Ibn Sayyad from being killed due to a grave error on his part&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The declaration made by Muhammad, identifying Ibn Sayyad as the Dajjal (Anti-Christ), proved to be a fatal mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the successful strategies employed by Judaism and Christianity, which utilized the concept of the Dajjal to instill fear in their followers, Muhammad adopted similar tactics. By invoking the idea of the Dajjal, he aimed to ensure the unwavering loyalty of his own followers and prevent any thoughts of disloyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, Muhammad extensively relied on revelations, speaking at length about the Dajjal and the dire consequences awaiting those who betrayed him. He also provided numerous signs to help his followers readily identify the Dajjal and protect themselves. Through this dramatic display, Muhammad sought to cultivate a sense of gratitude among his followers for providing them with vital information to defend themselves against the impending threat of the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, one of Muhammad's teachings regarding the unseen (ilm-ul-Ghaib) was that no Muslim would be able to kill the Dajjal. According to this belief, only Christ himself possessed the power to eliminate the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Ibn Sayyad had been killed, it would have constituted evidence that Muhammad had been fabricating claims about his knowledge of the unseen. Additionally, the belief in the Dajjal and all associated narratives would have perished alongside Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, it is noteworthy that Muhammad went so far as to protect Ibn Sayyad from harm, as eliminating him would have not only undermined Muhammad's credibility but also threatened the very foundation of the belief in the Dajjal. This situation unfolded when Umar Ibn Khattab took it upon himself to assassinate Ibn Sayyad for falsely proclaiming prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1354&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 1354&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Umar set out along with the Prophet with a group of people to Ibn Saiyad till they saw him playing with the boys near the hillocks of Bani Mughala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet) stroked him with his hand and said to him, &quot;Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger)? &quot; Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, &lt;b&gt;&quot;I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet, &lt;b&gt;&quot;Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger?&quot;&lt;/b&gt; The Prophet refuted it and said, &quot;I believe in Allah and His Apostles.&quot; Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), &quot;What do you think?&quot; Ibn Saiyad answered, &quot;True people and liars visit me.&quot; The Prophet) said, &quot;You have been confused as to this matter.&quot;&lt;b&gt; Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, &quot;I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)&quot; Ibn Saiyad said, &quot;It is Al-Dukh (the smoke).&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; On that `Umar, said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger)! Allow me to chop his head off.&quot; The Prophet said, &lt;b&gt;&quot;If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot overpower him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him.&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there are three additional concerns to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId789457&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First Issue: &lt;b&gt;Why was it of no use to kill Ibn Sayyad if he was not the Dajjal?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is understandable that Muhammad informed Umar that he would be unable to kill Ibn Sayyad if he were the real Dajjal, the question remains regarding Muhammad's statement that there would be no benefit in killing Ibn Sayyad if he was not the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that Ibn Sayyad was a liar who falsely claimed prophethood. This false claim made him an &lt;strong&gt;apostate&lt;/strong&gt;, and he openly denied the fundamental belief of Islam, which is the &quot;Finality of the Prophethood of Muhammad.&quot; Thus, Ibn Sayyad can be considered the most severe kind of apostate, who was corrupting the belief of people by preaching his false prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these circumstances, the question arises as to why the Prophet Muhammad informed Umar that there would be no advantage in killing Ibn Sayyad if he was not the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that Ibn Sayyad remained alive until the Battle of Hara, which took place 50 years after the death of Muhammad. During this period, Ibn Sayyad continued to claim knowledge of Unseen future events beyond what was perceptible (i.e. Ilm-ul-Ghayb علم ألغيب). Considering this, one may wonder why it would not have been beneficial for Umar to eliminate him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When seeking an answer to this query, one is unlikely to receive a satisfactory response from ٰIslamic apologists, apart from the assertion that Allah knows the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId946010&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Second Issue: Why did Muhammad not receive any revelation specifically addressing Ibn Sayyad's identity as the Dajjal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pertinent question arises: If Muhammad truly received revelations from Allah, why did he not receive any revelation throughout his life that definitively revealed whether Ibn Sayyad was a true or false prophet, and whether he was the Dajjal or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Muhammad refrained from directly killing Ibn Sayyad to maintain the narrative surrounding the existence of the Dajjal, he also did not want people to be influenced by Ibn Sayyad and follow him as another prophet. Such a scenario would have diminished Muhammad's own influence and reputation. Thus, while Muhammad defended Ibn Sayyad from harm, he simultaneously cast doubt on his prophethood by suggesting to people that he &quot;might&quot; be the Dajjal. This served as a means to create uncertainty and prevent Ibn Sayyad from gaining a significant following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId212962&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Third Issue: Muhammad was himself unable to get &quot;revelation&quot; if Ibn Sayyad was the Dajjal or not, but demanded Ibn Sayyad to IMMEDIATELY (on the spot) show a miracle through &quot;revelation&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad found himself incapable of receiving a revelation in the moment to determine whether Ibn Sayyad was indeed the Dajjal or not. However, he still demanded that Ibn Sayyad demonstrate a miracle on the spot and reveal Muhammad's thoughts instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a situation raises questions about the double standards of prophethood. On one hand, Muhammad was unable to obtain immediate revelations himself, yet he expected Ibn Sayyad to possess this ability. This incongruity is evident and merits further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is noteworthy that throughout the remainder of his life, Muhammad never received a revelation that definitively confirmed or refuted Ibn Sayyad's status as the Dajjal. This inconsistency further emphasizes the existence of double standards within this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId840076&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muhammad himself failed to show a miracle through &quot;revelation&quot; on the spot in front of the Meccans &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad demanded Ibn Sayyad to show the miracle on the spot, but he himself failed to show any miracle through &quot;revelation&quot; in front of the Meccans and the Jews of Medina, and the Quran is itself a witness to it. Please read our article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mod-articles-category-title &quot; href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/48-miracle-the-quranic-excuses-for-muhammad-s-inability-to-perform-any-miracle&quot;&gt;Miracle: The Quranic Excuses for Muhammad's Inability to perform any Miracle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are citing here only one tradition, which is a summary of the Quranic excuses for the inability of Muhammad to show even a single miracle in the above-mentioned article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/TheLifeOfMohammedGuillaume/page/n90/mode/1up?q=nadr&quot;&gt;Sirah of Ibn Ishaq, page 134&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, Muhammad,&quot; they said, &quot;if you won't accept any of our propositions, you know that no people are more short of land and water, and live a harder life than we, so ask your Lord, who has sent you, &lt;i&gt;to remove for us these mountains which shut us in, and to straighten out our country for us, and to open up in it rivers like those of Syria and Iraq ... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muhammad replied that he had not been sent to them with such an object. He had conveyed to them God's message, and they could either accept it with advantage, or reject it and await God's judgment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They said that if he would not do that for them, let him do something for himself. Ask God to send an angel with him to confirm what he said and to contradict them; ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muhammad replied that he would not do it, and would not ask for such things, for he was not sent to do so, and he repeated what he had said before.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said, 'Then let the heavens be dropped on us in pieces,' as you assert that your Lord could do if He wished, for we will not believe you unless you do so.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The apostle replied that this was a matter for God; if He wanted to do it with them, He would do it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said, &lt;em&gt;'Did not your Lord know that we would sit with you, and ask you these questions, so that He might come to you and instruct you how to answer us, and tell you what He was going to do with us, if we did not receive your message?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information has reached us that you are taught by this fellow in al-Yamama, called al-Rahman,&lt;/em&gt; and by God we will never believe in al-Rahman. Our conscience is clear. By God, we will not leave you and our treatment of you, until either we destroy you or you destroy us.' Some said, 'We worship the angels, who are the daughters of Allah.' Others said,&lt;em&gt; 'We will not believe in you until you come to us with God and the angels as a surety&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they said this the apostle of Allah got up and left them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see these &quot;Double Standards&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, neither Muhammad nor Ibn 'Sayyad were able to present any miracles. However, the key distinction lies in Muhammad's skilful ability to provide explanations and justifications for his inability, whereas Ibn 'Sayyad did not possess the same adeptness in offering excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that both individuals lacked the ability to demonstrate supernatural phenomena or miracles. Yet, Muhammad's talent for rationalizing his shortcomings allowed him to maintain his followers' faith and provide plausible reasons for the absence of miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Ibn 'Sayyad did not possess the same persuasive prowess and was unable to offer convincing excuses for his lack of miraculous demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contrast in their abilities to address their inability to perform miracles highlights Muhammad's proficiency in navigating such challenges and preserving his credibility in the eyes of his followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId547905&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some more traditions about Ibn Sayyad:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;st&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Tradition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1354&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 1354&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Later on Allah's Messenger once again went along with Ubai bin Ka`b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet saw him lying covered with a sheet &lt;strong&gt;and from where his murmurs were heard&lt;/strong&gt;. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw Allah's Apostle &lt;b&gt;while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees&lt;/b&gt;. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &quot;O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad.&quot; And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &quot;Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), &lt;b&gt;then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us reflect upon this intriguing aspect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Muhammad really got a &lt;strong&gt;revelation&lt;/strong&gt; from Allah, why was then it needed that Muhammad had to try to become a spy like James Bond 007, and to go near Ibn Sayyad secretly in order to hear what he was murmuring?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furthermore, how did Muhammad possess the knowledge, without any explicit &quot;revelation&quot;, that Ibn Sayyad was on the verge of revealing his true identity during those murmurs? &lt;/strong&gt;Such a claim could only have been made if a revelation had been received, as the information regarding Ibn Sayyad's intentions would fall under the category of the Unseen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, it appears perplexing that no direct revelation was forthcoming to confirm whether Ibn Sayyad was indeed the Dajjal or not. However, a revelation seemingly arrived on the spot, informing Muhammad that Ibn Sayyad was about to disclose his secret identity during that murmuring and prompting Muhammad to become Bond 007, to clandestinely listen to his murmurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These circumstances raise thought-provoking questions about the inconsistency of the revelation process and the sudden appearance of a specific revelation addressing Ibn Sayyad's actions. It introduces a peculiar contrast between the lack of direct revelations on Ibn Sayyad's identity as the Dajjal and the seemingly tailored revelation guiding Muhammad's covert actions at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;nd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Tradition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2927c&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2927c&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Sa`id al-Khudri reported: We came back after having performed Pilgrimage or `Umra and lbn Sa'id was along with us. And we encamped at a place and the people dispersed and I and he were left behind. I felt terribly frightened of him as it was said about him that he was the Dajjal. He brought his goods and placed them by my luggage and I said: It is intense heat. Would you not place that under that tree? And he did that. Then there appeared before us a flock of sheep. He went and brought a cup of milk and said: Abu Sa`id, drink that. I said it is intense heat and the milk is also hot (whereas the fact was) that I did not like to drink from his hands or to take it from his hand and he said: Abu Sa`id, I think that I should take a rope and suspend it by the tree and then commit suicide because of the talks of the people, and he further said. Abu Sa`id he who is ignorant of the saying of Allah's Messenger) (he is to be pardoned), but O people of Ansar, is this hadith of Allah's Messenger) concealed from you whereas you have the best knowledge of the hadith of Allah's Messenger) amongst people? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did Allah's Messenger) not say that he (Dajjal) would be a non believer whereas I am a believer? Did Allah's Messenger) not say he would be barren and no child would be born to him, whereas I have left my children in Medina? Did Allah's Messenger (may peace upon him) not say: He would not get into Medina and Mecca whereas I have been coming from Medina and now I intend to go to Mecca? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Abu Sa`id said: I was about to accept the excuse put forward by him. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then he said: I know the place where he would be born and where he is now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;So I said to him: May your whole day be spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is quite intriguing that Ibn Sayyad, who was believed by some to be the Dajjal, not only had children but his offspring were also Muslims. This raises questions and highlights the complexity surrounding this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is noteworthy that Ibn Sayyad continued to propagate false information about future events beyond the lifetime of Muhammad. This persistence in sharing supposed knowledge of the Unseen future leads one to contemplate Muhammad's earlier statement that killing Ibn Sayyad would serve no purpose if he was not the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;rd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Tradition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2932a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2932a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nafi' reported that Ibn 'Umar met Ibn Si'id on some of the paths of Medina and he said to him a word which enraged him and &lt;b&gt;he was so much swollen with anger that the way was blocked&lt;/b&gt;. Ibn 'Umar went to Hafsa and informed her about this. Thereupon she said: May Allah have mercy upon you, why did you incite Ibn Sayyad in spite of the fact that you knew it would be the extreme anger which would make Dajjal appear in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, it is highly unlikely for any rational individual to believe in such a fantastical tale where Ibn Sayyad's anger supposedly caused him to become swollen and an entire pathway to become blocked. Embracing such a narrative would not only be a disservice to human intellect but also a disregard for the principles of critical thinking and logical reasoning that define our understanding of the world. It is important to approach such stories with a skeptical mindset and base our beliefs on evidence, reason, and scientific inquiry rather than accepting unfounded and implausible assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId508853&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Fantasy story of Tamim Dari (a Sahabi) meeting with Dajjal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamim Dari, a former Christian, converted to Islam after Muhammad gained power in Medina. To please and impress Muhammad, Tamim concocted a fictional account of his encounter with the Dajjal. In this fabricated story, he claimed that the Dajjal acknowledged and confirmed Muhammad's prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad found great favor in this tale crafted by Tamim Dari, as it seemingly provided validation of his own divine status. The narrative aligned with Muhammad's teachings and strengthened the perception of his authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2942a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2942a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Allah's Messenger had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, &lt;b&gt;but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was telling, you about the Dajjal&lt;/b&gt;. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that island. &lt;b&gt;There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. &lt;/b&gt;They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. ... &lt;b&gt;He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet (i.e. Muhammad); what has he done? &lt;/b&gt;We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). &lt;strong&gt;He (the Dajjal) said: Do the Arabs fight against him?&lt;/strong&gt; We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with them? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Thereupon he said to us: Has it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said:&lt;b&gt; If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him.&lt;/b&gt; I am going to tell you about myself and &lt;b&gt;I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me&lt;/b&gt; and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allah's Messenger striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. &lt;b&gt;Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? 'The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hadith claims that Dajjal asked people that they should show obedience to Muhammad {&lt;b&gt;If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him&lt;/b&gt;}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reflecting on this narrative, a few questions arise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would the Dajjal, who harbored intense hostility towards Muhammad, encourage the Arabs to &lt;strong&gt;obey Muhammad&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logically, one would expect the Dajjal to advocate for the opposite, advising people not to follow Muhammad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes apparent that Muhammad and his companion Tamim Dari likely fabricated this story themselves. Muhammad propagated the fictional account of Tamim Dari to affirm his own prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this concocted tale posed a predicament for Muhammad. People could discern that the description, appearance, and other signs of the Dajjal presented in Tamim Dari's story differed significantly from those attributed to Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, according to Tamim Dari's account, the Dajjal was incapable of entering Medina, while Ibn Sayyad himself resided in Medina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Muhammad nor his companions were able to resolve this mystery. Even after 1400 years, Muslims today continue to grapple with the unresolved enigma presented by this narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId463147&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Excuse by Islam apologists: Ibn Sayyad was not the Dajjal, but Satan himself &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One prominent Muslim website, Islam Q&amp;amp;A, managed by Saudi Salafi Muftis, presents this excuse in an attempt to reconcile the inconsistencies related to the Dajjal and Ibn Sayyad(&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8301/who-was-ibn-sayyaad-was-he-the-false-messiah-al-maseeh-al-dajjaal&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scholars were &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;confused&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by the reports about Ibn Sayyaad. Some scholars said that he was the Dajjaal, and others said that he was not. Both groups had evidence (daleel) for what they said, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and their views conflicted a great deal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Ibn Hajar tried to reconcile the two views by saying: the best way in which we may reconcile what is said in the hadeeth of Tameem al-Daari and the view that Ibn Sayyaad was the Dajjaal is to say that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Dajjaal is the exact same person whom Tameem al-Daari saw chained up, and that Ibn Sayyaad was a shaytaan (a devil) who appeared in the image of the Dajjaal at that time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Fath al-Baari, 13/328)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 14 centuries, Muslims have grappled with the contradictions surrounding the stories of the Dajjal and Ibn Sayyad, leading them to resort to various excuses that were not originally put forth by Muhammad or his companions. Two of these excuses are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claiming that Ibn Sayyad was not the Dajjal but actually Satan himself, who took on the form of Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asserting that Ibn Sayyad was not the Dajjal, but rather a &quot;Smaller Dajjal&quot; or a lesser version of the Dajjal (الدجال الأصغر).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To refute these newly created excuses, it is worth noting that neither Prophet Muhammad nor his companions presented such explanations throughout their lives. None of them declared Ibn Sayyad to be either Satan or a Smaller Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in other traditions, Muhammad himself claimed to possess significant power, stating that he could see and recognize Satan and even had the ability to subdue him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/21/14&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 1210&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, 'Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to accept the notion that Muhammad possessed such remarkable power, it raises valid questions regarding his inability to recognize Ibn Sayyad as Satan and engage in a confrontation with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Muhammad truly had the ability to see and identify Satan, it begs the question of why he did not perceive the true nature of Ibn Sayyad. Additionally, one might wonder why Muhammad did not engage in physical combat or attempt to subdue Ibn Sayyad, considering his claimed capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These inquiries highlight a significant inconsistency within the narrative. If Muhammad possessed extraordinary powers as described in certain traditions, it becomes perplexing as to why he did not utilize them in the case of Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is worth considering why Muhammad did not recite the Islamic prayer &quot;Lahola Wala Quwat&quot; (meaning &quot;There is no power or strength except with Allah&quot;) if Ibn Sayyad was indeed Satan. According to Islamic beliefs, reciting this prayer is believed to help ward off Satan. If Ibn Sayyad was truly Satan, one would expect Muhammad to invoke this prayer to repel him. However, the reality contradicts this assumption, as Ibn Sayyad was observed participating in Islamic practices such as hearing the Adhan (call to prayer), offering prayers, and even performing Hajj pilgrimage. These actions serve as evidence that Ibn Sayyad was engaged in acts of devotion and indicate that he was not a Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId524817&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Islam Apologists: Ibn Sayyad was a Jewish Conspiracy against Islam&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Islam apologists have resorted to their familiar tactic of attributing Ibn Sayyad to a Jewish conspiracy (just like ‘Abdullah Ibn Saba). They propagate the idea that Ibn Sayyad converted to Islam after the death of Prophet Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the truth remains quite different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ibn Sayyad actually embraced Islam as a child when Muhammad encountered him while he was playing with other children. Muhammad asked Ibn Sayyad if he testified to the prophethood of Allah, and Ibn Sayyad affirmed his belief in Muhammad's prophethood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ibn Sayyad himself used to perform ‘Umra and ‘’Hajj’ too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, it is important to note that Ibn Sayyad's wife was also a Muslim, and their children followed the Islamic faith. 'Ammara bin 'Abdullah ibn Sayyad, one of their children, not only embraced Islam but also became a narrator of Hadiths from Muhammad. Imam Malik even included Ahadith narrated by him in his book, Muwatta Imam Malik. It is indeed peculiar that the offspring of someone believed to be the Dajjal/Satan were actively involved in transmitting the teachings of Muhammad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it not strange that the children of Dajjal/Satan were narrating the Ahadith of Muhammad, while the Dajjal/Satan was himself performing the Hajjs and ‘Umras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many Muslims have been indoctrinated and conditioned to believe that Ibn Sayyad was the so-called Antichrist Dajjal, as their prophet claimed. However, when one critically examines the incident surrounding Ibn Sayyad, it becomes increasingly challenging to accept the notion of Muhammad's prophethood and the authenticity of divine revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, when individuals with a discerning mind analyze the account of Ibn Sayyad, it becomes highly improbable for them to accept the concept of Muhammad's prophethood or the existence of divine revelation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Sayyad was a 13 years old boy, who also claimed prophethood, just like Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While his claim of prophethood could have decreased the market value of Muhammad’s own claim of prophethood, thus Muhammad immediately declared him to be the ‘Dajjal’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, people became confused at that and some of them started doubting Muhammad. It was due to the reason that Muhammad had already told them the clear sins of ‘Dajjal’. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dajjal is blind in the right eye and his eye looks like a bulging out grape (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3439&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukahri, 3439&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the word KAFIR is written between his two eyes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2930a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2930a&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dajjal cannot enter in Medina (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7125&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 7125&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, Muhammad told tons of signs of Dajjal, but none of them fit Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Muhammad realized his mistake, he immediately retreated, and took a new position that he was only ‘&lt;b&gt;Doubtful&lt;/b&gt;’ if Ibn Sayyad was Dajjal or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It exposes the '&lt;strong&gt;Human Errors&lt;/strong&gt;' in the so-called '&lt;strong&gt;Divine Revelation&lt;/strong&gt;' which ultimately means that there is no Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelations on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very unfortunate that 99% of people (including Muslims) don’t know about this incident, although this incident of Ibn Sayyad is as important as the incident of ‘Satanic Verses’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help to spread this information among the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Sayyad was also known as Ibn Sa’id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId212962&quot;&gt;Third Issue: Muhammad was himself unable to get &quot;revelation&quot; if Ibn Sayyad was the Dajjal or not, but demanded Ibn Sayyad to IMMEDIATELY (on the spot) show a miracle through &quot;revelation&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId840076&quot;&gt;Muhammad himself failed to show a miracle through &quot;revelation&quot; on the spot in front of the Meccans &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId813112&quot;&gt;Muhammad also failed in front of Jews of showing any miracle through &quot;revelation&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId547905&quot;&gt;Some more traditions about Ibn Sayyad:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId508853&quot;&gt;A Fantasy story of Tamim Dari (a Sahabi) meeting with Dajjal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId463147&quot;&gt;Excuse by Islam apologists: Ibn Sayyad was not the Dajjal, but Satan himself &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId524817&quot;&gt;Islam Apologists: Ibn Sayyad was a Jewish Conspiracy against Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId104130&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad found himself in the position of having to protect Ibn Sayyad from being killed due to a grave error on his part&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The declaration made by Muhammad, identifying Ibn Sayyad as the Dajjal (Anti-Christ), proved to be a fatal mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the successful strategies employed by Judaism and Christianity, which utilized the concept of the Dajjal to instill fear in their followers, Muhammad adopted similar tactics. By invoking the idea of the Dajjal, he aimed to ensure the unwavering loyalty of his own followers and prevent any thoughts of disloyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, Muhammad extensively relied on revelations, speaking at length about the Dajjal and the dire consequences awaiting those who betrayed him. He also provided numerous signs to help his followers readily identify the Dajjal and protect themselves. Through this dramatic display, Muhammad sought to cultivate a sense of gratitude among his followers for providing them with vital information to defend themselves against the impending threat of the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, one of Muhammad's teachings regarding the unseen (ilm-ul-Ghaib) was that no Muslim would be able to kill the Dajjal. According to this belief, only Christ himself possessed the power to eliminate the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if Ibn Sayyad had been killed, it would have constituted evidence that Muhammad had been fabricating claims about his knowledge of the unseen. Additionally, the belief in the Dajjal and all associated narratives would have perished alongside Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, it is noteworthy that Muhammad went so far as to protect Ibn Sayyad from harm, as eliminating him would have not only undermined Muhammad's credibility but also threatened the very foundation of the belief in the Dajjal. This situation unfolded when Umar Ibn Khattab took it upon himself to assassinate Ibn Sayyad for falsely proclaiming prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1354&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 1354&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Umar set out along with the Prophet with a group of people to Ibn Saiyad till they saw him playing with the boys near the hillocks of Bani Mughala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet) stroked him with his hand and said to him, &quot;Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger)? &quot; Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, &lt;b&gt;&quot;I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet, &lt;b&gt;&quot;Do you testify that I am Allah's Messenger?&quot;&lt;/b&gt; The Prophet refuted it and said, &quot;I believe in Allah and His Apostles.&quot; Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), &quot;What do you think?&quot; Ibn Saiyad answered, &quot;True people and liars visit me.&quot; The Prophet) said, &quot;You have been confused as to this matter.&quot;&lt;b&gt; Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, &quot;I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)&quot; Ibn Saiyad said, &quot;It is Al-Dukh (the smoke).&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; On that `Umar, said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger)! Allow me to chop his head off.&quot; The Prophet said, &lt;b&gt;&quot;If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot overpower him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him.&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there are three additional concerns to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId789457&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First Issue: &lt;b&gt;Why was it of no use to kill Ibn Sayyad if he was not the Dajjal?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is understandable that Muhammad informed Umar that he would be unable to kill Ibn Sayyad if he were the real Dajjal, the question remains regarding Muhammad's statement that there would be no benefit in killing Ibn Sayyad if he was not the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that Ibn Sayyad was a liar who falsely claimed prophethood. This false claim made him an &lt;strong&gt;apostate&lt;/strong&gt;, and he openly denied the fundamental belief of Islam, which is the &quot;Finality of the Prophethood of Muhammad.&quot; Thus, Ibn Sayyad can be considered the most severe kind of apostate, who was corrupting the belief of people by preaching his false prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these circumstances, the question arises as to why the Prophet Muhammad informed Umar that there would be no advantage in killing Ibn Sayyad if he was not the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that Ibn Sayyad remained alive until the Battle of Hara, which took place 50 years after the death of Muhammad. During this period, Ibn Sayyad continued to claim knowledge of Unseen future events beyond what was perceptible (i.e. Ilm-ul-Ghayb علم ألغيب). Considering this, one may wonder why it would not have been beneficial for Umar to eliminate him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When seeking an answer to this query, one is unlikely to receive a satisfactory response from ٰIslamic apologists, apart from the assertion that Allah knows the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId946010&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Second Issue: Why did Muhammad not receive any revelation specifically addressing Ibn Sayyad's identity as the Dajjal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pertinent question arises: If Muhammad truly received revelations from Allah, why did he not receive any revelation throughout his life that definitively revealed whether Ibn Sayyad was a true or false prophet, and whether he was the Dajjal or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Muhammad refrained from directly killing Ibn Sayyad to maintain the narrative surrounding the existence of the Dajjal, he also did not want people to be influenced by Ibn Sayyad and follow him as another prophet. Such a scenario would have diminished Muhammad's own influence and reputation. Thus, while Muhammad defended Ibn Sayyad from harm, he simultaneously cast doubt on his prophethood by suggesting to people that he &quot;might&quot; be the Dajjal. This served as a means to create uncertainty and prevent Ibn Sayyad from gaining a significant following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId212962&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Third Issue: Muhammad was himself unable to get &quot;revelation&quot; if Ibn Sayyad was the Dajjal or not, but demanded Ibn Sayyad to IMMEDIATELY (on the spot) show a miracle through &quot;revelation&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad found himself incapable of receiving a revelation in the moment to determine whether Ibn Sayyad was indeed the Dajjal or not. However, he still demanded that Ibn Sayyad demonstrate a miracle on the spot and reveal Muhammad's thoughts instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a situation raises questions about the double standards of prophethood. On one hand, Muhammad was unable to obtain immediate revelations himself, yet he expected Ibn Sayyad to possess this ability. This incongruity is evident and merits further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is noteworthy that throughout the remainder of his life, Muhammad never received a revelation that definitively confirmed or refuted Ibn Sayyad's status as the Dajjal. This inconsistency further emphasizes the existence of double standards within this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId840076&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muhammad himself failed to show a miracle through &quot;revelation&quot; on the spot in front of the Meccans &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad demanded Ibn Sayyad to show the miracle on the spot, but he himself failed to show any miracle through &quot;revelation&quot; in front of the Meccans and the Jews of Medina, and the Quran is itself a witness to it. Please read our article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mod-articles-category-title &quot; href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/divine-revelation-or-human-drama/48-miracle-the-quranic-excuses-for-muhammad-s-inability-to-perform-any-miracle&quot;&gt;Miracle: The Quranic Excuses for Muhammad's Inability to perform any Miracle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are citing here only one tradition, which is a summary of the Quranic excuses for the inability of Muhammad to show even a single miracle in the above-mentioned article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/TheLifeOfMohammedGuillaume/page/n90/mode/1up?q=nadr&quot;&gt;Sirah of Ibn Ishaq, page 134&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, Muhammad,&quot; they said, &quot;if you won't accept any of our propositions, you know that no people are more short of land and water, and live a harder life than we, so ask your Lord, who has sent you, &lt;i&gt;to remove for us these mountains which shut us in, and to straighten out our country for us, and to open up in it rivers like those of Syria and Iraq ... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muhammad replied that he had not been sent to them with such an object. He had conveyed to them God's message, and they could either accept it with advantage, or reject it and await God's judgment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They said that if he would not do that for them, let him do something for himself. Ask God to send an angel with him to confirm what he said and to contradict them; ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muhammad replied that he would not do it, and would not ask for such things, for he was not sent to do so, and he repeated what he had said before.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said, 'Then let the heavens be dropped on us in pieces,' as you assert that your Lord could do if He wished, for we will not believe you unless you do so.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The apostle replied that this was a matter for God; if He wanted to do it with them, He would do it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said, &lt;em&gt;'Did not your Lord know that we would sit with you, and ask you these questions, so that He might come to you and instruct you how to answer us, and tell you what He was going to do with us, if we did not receive your message?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information has reached us that you are taught by this fellow in al-Yamama, called al-Rahman,&lt;/em&gt; and by God we will never believe in al-Rahman. Our conscience is clear. By God, we will not leave you and our treatment of you, until either we destroy you or you destroy us.' Some said, 'We worship the angels, who are the daughters of Allah.' Others said,&lt;em&gt; 'We will not believe in you until you come to us with God and the angels as a surety&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they said this the apostle of Allah got up and left them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see these &quot;Double Standards&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, neither Muhammad nor Ibn 'Sayyad were able to present any miracles. However, the key distinction lies in Muhammad's skilful ability to provide explanations and justifications for his inability, whereas Ibn 'Sayyad did not possess the same adeptness in offering excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that both individuals lacked the ability to demonstrate supernatural phenomena or miracles. Yet, Muhammad's talent for rationalizing his shortcomings allowed him to maintain his followers' faith and provide plausible reasons for the absence of miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Ibn 'Sayyad did not possess the same persuasive prowess and was unable to offer convincing excuses for his lack of miraculous demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contrast in their abilities to address their inability to perform miracles highlights Muhammad's proficiency in navigating such challenges and preserving his credibility in the eyes of his followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId547905&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some more traditions about Ibn Sayyad:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;st&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Tradition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1354&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 1354&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Later on Allah's Messenger once again went along with Ubai bin Ka`b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet saw him lying covered with a sheet &lt;strong&gt;and from where his murmurs were heard&lt;/strong&gt;. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw Allah's Apostle &lt;b&gt;while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees&lt;/b&gt;. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &quot;O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad.&quot; And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &quot;Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), &lt;b&gt;then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us reflect upon this intriguing aspect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Muhammad really got a &lt;strong&gt;revelation&lt;/strong&gt; from Allah, why was then it needed that Muhammad had to try to become a spy like James Bond 007, and to go near Ibn Sayyad secretly in order to hear what he was murmuring?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furthermore, how did Muhammad possess the knowledge, without any explicit &quot;revelation&quot;, that Ibn Sayyad was on the verge of revealing his true identity during those murmurs? &lt;/strong&gt;Such a claim could only have been made if a revelation had been received, as the information regarding Ibn Sayyad's intentions would fall under the category of the Unseen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, it appears perplexing that no direct revelation was forthcoming to confirm whether Ibn Sayyad was indeed the Dajjal or not. However, a revelation seemingly arrived on the spot, informing Muhammad that Ibn Sayyad was about to disclose his secret identity during that murmuring and prompting Muhammad to become Bond 007, to clandestinely listen to his murmurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These circumstances raise thought-provoking questions about the inconsistency of the revelation process and the sudden appearance of a specific revelation addressing Ibn Sayyad's actions. It introduces a peculiar contrast between the lack of direct revelations on Ibn Sayyad's identity as the Dajjal and the seemingly tailored revelation guiding Muhammad's covert actions at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;nd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Tradition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2927c&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2927c&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Sa`id al-Khudri reported: We came back after having performed Pilgrimage or `Umra and lbn Sa'id was along with us. And we encamped at a place and the people dispersed and I and he were left behind. I felt terribly frightened of him as it was said about him that he was the Dajjal. He brought his goods and placed them by my luggage and I said: It is intense heat. Would you not place that under that tree? And he did that. Then there appeared before us a flock of sheep. He went and brought a cup of milk and said: Abu Sa`id, drink that. I said it is intense heat and the milk is also hot (whereas the fact was) that I did not like to drink from his hands or to take it from his hand and he said: Abu Sa`id, I think that I should take a rope and suspend it by the tree and then commit suicide because of the talks of the people, and he further said. Abu Sa`id he who is ignorant of the saying of Allah's Messenger) (he is to be pardoned), but O people of Ansar, is this hadith of Allah's Messenger) concealed from you whereas you have the best knowledge of the hadith of Allah's Messenger) amongst people? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did Allah's Messenger) not say that he (Dajjal) would be a non believer whereas I am a believer? Did Allah's Messenger) not say he would be barren and no child would be born to him, whereas I have left my children in Medina? Did Allah's Messenger (may peace upon him) not say: He would not get into Medina and Mecca whereas I have been coming from Medina and now I intend to go to Mecca? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Abu Sa`id said: I was about to accept the excuse put forward by him. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then he said: I know the place where he would be born and where he is now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;So I said to him: May your whole day be spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is quite intriguing that Ibn Sayyad, who was believed by some to be the Dajjal, not only had children but his offspring were also Muslims. This raises questions and highlights the complexity surrounding this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is noteworthy that Ibn Sayyad continued to propagate false information about future events beyond the lifetime of Muhammad. This persistence in sharing supposed knowledge of the Unseen future leads one to contemplate Muhammad's earlier statement that killing Ibn Sayyad would serve no purpose if he was not the Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;rd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Tradition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2932a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2932a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nafi' reported that Ibn 'Umar met Ibn Si'id on some of the paths of Medina and he said to him a word which enraged him and &lt;b&gt;he was so much swollen with anger that the way was blocked&lt;/b&gt;. Ibn 'Umar went to Hafsa and informed her about this. Thereupon she said: May Allah have mercy upon you, why did you incite Ibn Sayyad in spite of the fact that you knew it would be the extreme anger which would make Dajjal appear in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, it is highly unlikely for any rational individual to believe in such a fantastical tale where Ibn Sayyad's anger supposedly caused him to become swollen and an entire pathway to become blocked. Embracing such a narrative would not only be a disservice to human intellect but also a disregard for the principles of critical thinking and logical reasoning that define our understanding of the world. It is important to approach such stories with a skeptical mindset and base our beliefs on evidence, reason, and scientific inquiry rather than accepting unfounded and implausible assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId508853&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Fantasy story of Tamim Dari (a Sahabi) meeting with Dajjal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamim Dari, a former Christian, converted to Islam after Muhammad gained power in Medina. To please and impress Muhammad, Tamim concocted a fictional account of his encounter with the Dajjal. In this fabricated story, he claimed that the Dajjal acknowledged and confirmed Muhammad's prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad found great favor in this tale crafted by Tamim Dari, as it seemingly provided validation of his own divine status. The narrative aligned with Muhammad's teachings and strengthened the perception of his authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2942a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2942a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Allah's Messenger had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, &lt;b&gt;but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was telling, you about the Dajjal&lt;/b&gt;. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that island. &lt;b&gt;There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. &lt;/b&gt;They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. ... &lt;b&gt;He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet (i.e. Muhammad); what has he done? &lt;/b&gt;We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). &lt;strong&gt;He (the Dajjal) said: Do the Arabs fight against him?&lt;/strong&gt; We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with them? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Thereupon he said to us: Has it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said:&lt;b&gt; If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him.&lt;/b&gt; I am going to tell you about myself and &lt;b&gt;I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me&lt;/b&gt; and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allah's Messenger striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. &lt;b&gt;Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? 'The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hadith claims that Dajjal asked people that they should show obedience to Muhammad {&lt;b&gt;If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him&lt;/b&gt;}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reflecting on this narrative, a few questions arise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would the Dajjal, who harbored intense hostility towards Muhammad, encourage the Arabs to &lt;strong&gt;obey Muhammad&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logically, one would expect the Dajjal to advocate for the opposite, advising people not to follow Muhammad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes apparent that Muhammad and his companion Tamim Dari likely fabricated this story themselves. Muhammad propagated the fictional account of Tamim Dari to affirm his own prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this concocted tale posed a predicament for Muhammad. People could discern that the description, appearance, and other signs of the Dajjal presented in Tamim Dari's story differed significantly from those attributed to Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, according to Tamim Dari's account, the Dajjal was incapable of entering Medina, while Ibn Sayyad himself resided in Medina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Muhammad nor his companions were able to resolve this mystery. Even after 1400 years, Muslims today continue to grapple with the unresolved enigma presented by this narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId463147&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Excuse by Islam apologists: Ibn Sayyad was not the Dajjal, but Satan himself &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One prominent Muslim website, Islam Q&amp;amp;A, managed by Saudi Salafi Muftis, presents this excuse in an attempt to reconcile the inconsistencies related to the Dajjal and Ibn Sayyad(&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8301/who-was-ibn-sayyaad-was-he-the-false-messiah-al-maseeh-al-dajjaal&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scholars were &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;confused&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by the reports about Ibn Sayyaad. Some scholars said that he was the Dajjaal, and others said that he was not. Both groups had evidence (daleel) for what they said, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and their views conflicted a great deal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Ibn Hajar tried to reconcile the two views by saying: the best way in which we may reconcile what is said in the hadeeth of Tameem al-Daari and the view that Ibn Sayyaad was the Dajjaal is to say that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Dajjaal is the exact same person whom Tameem al-Daari saw chained up, and that Ibn Sayyaad was a shaytaan (a devil) who appeared in the image of the Dajjaal at that time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Fath al-Baari, 13/328)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 14 centuries, Muslims have grappled with the contradictions surrounding the stories of the Dajjal and Ibn Sayyad, leading them to resort to various excuses that were not originally put forth by Muhammad or his companions. Two of these excuses are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claiming that Ibn Sayyad was not the Dajjal but actually Satan himself, who took on the form of Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asserting that Ibn Sayyad was not the Dajjal, but rather a &quot;Smaller Dajjal&quot; or a lesser version of the Dajjal (الدجال الأصغر).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To refute these newly created excuses, it is worth noting that neither Prophet Muhammad nor his companions presented such explanations throughout their lives. None of them declared Ibn Sayyad to be either Satan or a Smaller Dajjal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in other traditions, Muhammad himself claimed to possess significant power, stating that he could see and recognize Satan and even had the ability to subdue him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/21/14&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 1210&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, 'Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to accept the notion that Muhammad possessed such remarkable power, it raises valid questions regarding his inability to recognize Ibn Sayyad as Satan and engage in a confrontation with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Muhammad truly had the ability to see and identify Satan, it begs the question of why he did not perceive the true nature of Ibn Sayyad. Additionally, one might wonder why Muhammad did not engage in physical combat or attempt to subdue Ibn Sayyad, considering his claimed capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These inquiries highlight a significant inconsistency within the narrative. If Muhammad possessed extraordinary powers as described in certain traditions, it becomes perplexing as to why he did not utilize them in the case of Ibn Sayyad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is worth considering why Muhammad did not recite the Islamic prayer &quot;Lahola Wala Quwat&quot; (meaning &quot;There is no power or strength except with Allah&quot;) if Ibn Sayyad was indeed Satan. According to Islamic beliefs, reciting this prayer is believed to help ward off Satan. If Ibn Sayyad was truly Satan, one would expect Muhammad to invoke this prayer to repel him. However, the reality contradicts this assumption, as Ibn Sayyad was observed participating in Islamic practices such as hearing the Adhan (call to prayer), offering prayers, and even performing Hajj pilgrimage. These actions serve as evidence that Ibn Sayyad was engaged in acts of devotion and indicate that he was not a Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId524817&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Islam Apologists: Ibn Sayyad was a Jewish Conspiracy against Islam&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Islam apologists have resorted to their familiar tactic of attributing Ibn Sayyad to a Jewish conspiracy (just like ‘Abdullah Ibn Saba). They propagate the idea that Ibn Sayyad converted to Islam after the death of Prophet Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the truth remains quite different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ibn Sayyad actually embraced Islam as a child when Muhammad encountered him while he was playing with other children. Muhammad asked Ibn Sayyad if he testified to the prophethood of Allah, and Ibn Sayyad affirmed his belief in Muhammad's prophethood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ibn Sayyad himself used to perform ‘Umra and ‘’Hajj’ too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, it is important to note that Ibn Sayyad's wife was also a Muslim, and their children followed the Islamic faith. 'Ammara bin 'Abdullah ibn Sayyad, one of their children, not only embraced Islam but also became a narrator of Hadiths from Muhammad. Imam Malik even included Ahadith narrated by him in his book, Muwatta Imam Malik. It is indeed peculiar that the offspring of someone believed to be the Dajjal/Satan were actively involved in transmitting the teachings of Muhammad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it not strange that the children of Dajjal/Satan were narrating the Ahadith of Muhammad, while the Dajjal/Satan was himself performing the Hajjs and ‘Umras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many Muslims have been indoctrinated and conditioned to believe that Ibn Sayyad was the so-called Antichrist Dajjal, as their prophet claimed. However, when one critically examines the incident surrounding Ibn Sayyad, it becomes increasingly challenging to accept the notion of Muhammad's prophethood and the authenticity of divine revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, when individuals with a discerning mind analyze the account of Ibn Sayyad, it becomes highly improbable for them to accept the concept of Muhammad's prophethood or the existence of divine revelation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the 6th year of Hijri, Muhammad and the Muslim community embarked on a journey to Mecca with the intention of performing the 'Umra (lesser pilgrimage) of the Kaaba. As they approached Mecca, Muhammad sent 'Uthman as a messenger to convey their peaceful intentions to the Meccans, emphasizing that their visit was not for the purpose of warfare but solely for the 'Umra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, rumors spread that 'Uthman had been killed by the Meccans, though in reality, he was unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing this news, Muhammad gathered the Muslims and called for a pledge of allegiance to fight against the Meccans and seek revenge for 'Uthman's alleged death. In that moment, Muhammad claimed that Jibril (Gabriel) had appeared to him, and Allah revealed a verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/48.10?context=3&quot;&gt;48:10&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br&gt;Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you, [O Muhammad] - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;they are actually pledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Allah is over their hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;So he who breaks his word only breaks it to the detriment of himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008000;&quot;&gt; And he who fulfills that which he has promised Allah - He will give him a great reward&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to everyone's surprise, 'Uthman himself appeared alive in the Muslim camp later, refuting the earlier belief of his demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why even send down Gabriel and revelation at this point to back up the wrong assumption? This &lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Full Participation&lt;/span&gt;&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;of Allah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in this allegiance raises questions about Allah's knowledge of the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fd0000;&quot;&gt;unseen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. Despite the participation of Allah in the process of allegiance and the promised rewards for avenging 'Uthman's blood, Allah seemingly did not know that 'Uthman was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer to this conundrum is that there is no Allah in the heavens, but rather Muhammad himself was responsible for the revelations. Since Muhammad was a human and did not possess knowledge of the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fd0000;&quot;&gt;unseen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, he mistakenly believed that 'Uthman had been killed, leading Allah to share the same belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident serves as significant evidence that Allah does not exist as a separate entity but that Muhammad himself was the source of the revelations&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Noto Sans, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;, i.e.: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial Black, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muhammad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;b&gt;=&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial Black, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allah&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Please deeply contemplate on this incident, as it alone provides sufficient evidence to see the reality of the religion and to make yourself free of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Muslim Apologist: It was a TEST from Allah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question arises that if it was indeed a test, then as soon as the test ended (i.e., as soon as the Companions finished taking the pledge), a divine revelation would have informed them that it was a test, and they have succeeded and Allah is pleased with them, and the good news was that Uthman was not killed but was alive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the issue is that even after the test and the pledge, divine revelation remains silent about Uthman being alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think about it; thinking is not a crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became impossible for modern Islamic apologists to deny millions of testimonies of these millions of Muslim gay people. This ultimately compelled modern Islamic apologists to come up with a new narrative i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&quot;Although one may feel helpless when they fall in love with someone of the same sex, nevertheless, Allah prohibited it, considering it a &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test or Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. You are not committing a sin simply because you are gay and feel attracted to someone of your own sex and fall in love with them, but engaging in sexual acts with them would be considered a sin and you must be killed in most horrible ways.. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ), and said: My wife does not prevent the hand of a man who touches her (i.e. who fornicates with her). He said: Divorce her. He then said: I am afraid my inner self may covet her. He said: Then (keep) enjoying her (as your wife).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for Ibn 'Abbas, this same hadith has also been narrated by Hisham (the slave of Muhammad) and companion Jabir bin Abdullah (جابر بن عبدالله).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir recorded it from Hisham and Jabir bin Abdullah Ansari (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/3597_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AC-%D9%A5/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_0?pageno=342&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ومنهم هشام مولى &lt;span title=&quot;الرسول الأكرم محمد بن عبد الله صلى الله عليه وآله&quot;&gt;النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم&lt;/span&gt; قال &lt;span title=&quot;محمد بن سعد&quot;&gt;محمد بن سعد&lt;/span&gt;: أنبأنا سليمان بن عبيد الله الرقي، أنبأنا &lt;span title=&quot;محمد بن أيوب&quot;&gt;محمد بن أيوب&lt;/span&gt; الرقي، عن سفيان، عن &lt;span title=&quot;عبد الكريم&quot;&gt;عبد الكريم&lt;/span&gt;، عن أبي الزبير عن هشام مولى &lt;span title=&quot;الرسول الأكرم محمد بن عبد الله صلى الله عليه وآله&quot;&gt;رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم&lt;/span&gt;. قال: جاء رجل فقال يا رسول الله إن امرأتي لا تدفع &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;يد لامس&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;، قال &quot; طلقها &quot; قال: إنها تعجبني، قال &quot; فتمتع بها &quot; قال ابن منده وقد رواه جماعة عن &lt;span title=&quot;سفيان الثوري&quot;&gt;سفيان الثوري&lt;/span&gt;، عن أبي الزبير، عن مولى &lt;span title=&quot;بنو هاشم&quot;&gt;بني هاشم&lt;/span&gt; عن &lt;span title=&quot;الرسول الأكرم محمد بن عبد الله صلى الله عليه وآله&quot;&gt;النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم&lt;/span&gt; ولم يسمه. ورواه &lt;span title=&quot;عبيد الله بن عمرو&quot;&gt;عبيد الله بن عمرو&lt;/span&gt; عن &lt;span title=&quot;عبد الكريم&quot;&gt;عبد الكريم&lt;/span&gt; عن أبي الزبير عن جابر.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot; A man came and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, my wife does not repel my touch.' He said, 'Divorce her.' The man said, 'But I love her.' He said, 'Then enjoy her.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: In this hadith, the phrase &quot;يَدَ لاَمِسٍ&quot; is used, which literally means &quot;to touch.&quot; However, according to Arabic language usage, it carries the meaning of &quot;to engage in sexual intercourse.&quot; The same term &quot;to touch&quot; has been employed with the same connotation of &quot;engaging in sexual intercourse&quot; in the Quran itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.237&quot;&gt;2:237&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَإِن طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; تَمَسُّوهُنَّ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if ye divorce them before &lt;strong&gt;touching them (i.e. doing intercourse)&lt;/strong&gt;, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (Is due to them)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Muslim Scholars are unanimous that “touching” here means to engage in sexual intercourse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Ibn Kathir writes in the commentary under this verse 2:237, that it means &quot;penetration دخول&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=2&amp;amp;tAyahNo=237&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;هذه الآية الكريمة مما يدل على اختصاص المتعة بما دلت عليه الآية الأولى، حيث إنما أوجب في هذه الآية نصف المهر المفروض إذا طلق الزوج قبل &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;الدخول&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Ayah (2:237) requires the husband to relinquish half of the appointed Mahr if he divorces his wife before the &lt;strong&gt;penetration &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;الدخول&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) i.e. before the marriage is consummated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see the contradiction where, on one hand, there is a draconian punishment of 'stoning till death' by Islamic Sharia if a married woman engages in sex? But on the other hand, if she is beautiful, then this same Islamic Sharia is teaching to keep enjoying her only for your lust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also see the verse An-Nisa 4:43&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.23&quot;&gt;4:43&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَقْرَبُواْ الصَّلاَةَ وَأَنتُمْ سُكَارَى حَتَّىَ تَعْلَمُواْ مَا تَقُولُونَ وَلاَ جُنُبًا إِلاَّ عَابِرِي سَبِيلٍ حَتَّىَ تَغْتَسِلُواْ وَإِن كُنتُم مَّرْضَى أَوْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَاءَ أَحَدٌ مِّنكُم مِّنَ الْغَائِطِ أَوْ لاَ&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;مَسْتُمُ النِّسَاء&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; فَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ مَاء فَتَيَمَّمُواْ صَعِيدًا طَيِّبًا فَامْسَحُواْ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُمْ إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ عَفُوًّا غَفُورًا&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;O you who believe! Approach not As-Salat (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state of Janaba, (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath) except when traveling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body. And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; or you have touched&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a women &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(i.e. engaged in sexual intercourse)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merely touching a woman does not require one to take a bath. However, it is sexual intercourse that leads to a state of Janaba, indicating sexual impurity, for which a bath is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The contradiction between the Quran and Muhammad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;highlightable&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #f8cac6;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Contradiction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Muhammad emphasized the importance of modesty, decency, chastity, and the practice of Hijab, discouraging interactions with the opposite gender, and prescribing the severe punishment of stoning for adultery. On the other hand, Muhammad instructed his companion to continue enjoying his beautiful wife, even in the event of her engaging in adultery with other men (companions?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #013b01; background-color: #bfedd2;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Contradiction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the incident of IFK, three companions testified against 'Aisha's character. However, Muhammad desired to clear 'Aisha of the accusation, as it indirectly challenged his claim of prophethood. Consequently, he claimed the revelation of the following verses, which were intended to serve as evidence of 'Aisha's innocence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.3&quot;&gt;24:3&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٱلزَّانِى لَا يَنكِحُ إِلَّا زَانِيَةً أَوْ مُشْرِكَةً وَٱلزَّانِيَةُ لَا يَنكِحُهَآ إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.26&quot;&gt;24:26&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٱلْخَبِيثَٰتُ لِلْخَبِيثِينَ وَٱلْخَبِيثُونَ لِلْخَبِيثَٰتِ ۖ وَٱلطَّيِّبَٰتُ لِلطَّيِّبِينَ وَٱلطَّيِّبُونَ لِلطَّيِّبَٰتِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مُبَرَّءُونَ مِمَّا يَقُولُونَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impure women are for impure men and impure men for impure women, and pure women are for pure men and pure men for pure women. They are free from those scandals which the slanderers utter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in instructing his companions to continue deriving sexual pleasure from his beautiful wife, Muhammad seemingly overlooked the fact that during the incident of IFK, he had already declared that pure men are meant for pure women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this occurrence proves that there exists no Allah in the heavens, and Muhammad, being human, made this mistake due to forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it is up to you to decide whether a religion with such significant contradictions can truly originate from a divine being in the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_10la _10lg&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0007ff; background-color: #bfedd2;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem; background-color: #bfedd2;&quot;&gt;3rd Contradiction: That companion was a cuckold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/nasai:2562&quot;&gt;Sunan Nisai, 2562&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Messenger of Allah said: &quot;There are three at whom Allah will not look on the Day of Resurrection: The one who disobeys his parents, the woman who imitates men in her outward appearance, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and the cuckold (i.e. a man whose wife is sexually unfaithful)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It serves as another evidence of Muhammad's contradiction. He expressed one viewpoint on a certain matter and contradicted himself on another. Being a human, he was susceptible to making such mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The issue of Parentage of the child&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect to consider is the issue of parentage, which becomes exceedingly complex if the woman is conceiving a child from her husband or other men who engage in sexual relations with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in this case, Muhammad seemed to overlook the fact that he had mandated severe punishments for unmarried couples, all in the name of safeguarding the child's lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Muslims are questioned about why Islam imposes such draconian punishments like stoning to death, they proudly assert that it is to protect the child's parentage, preventing them from living under the same roof as non-Mahram siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, do these Muslims realize that a child born to such a beautiful woman from another man is considered non-Mahram to the husband's other wives and daughters? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;Yet, the husband is obligated to bestow his name upon that child and raise him alongside his other wives and daughters in the same household.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that Muslims are unable to perceive these logical contradictions within their religion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1st excuse from Islamic apologists: This hadith is only about a barren women &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Islamic apologist stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abu Dawud recorded this hadith under the chapter titled &quot;Prohibition of Marrying Women Who Do Not Give Birth.&quot; This implies that there would be no issue of parentage while continuing to enjoy her as a wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no explicit indication within this hadith itself that it solely pertains to barren women. The absence of any mention of barren women is consistent across all versions of this hadith, including the one narrated by Ibn Abbas. Therefore, it holds no significance that Abu Dawud recorded it under a chapter concerning barren women. No angel came to Abu Dawud directly to inform him that this hadith exclusively applies to barren women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we consider this logically, there are many couples who do not conceive despite attempting for numerous years. However, after several years, the wife does become pregnant. In that era, there was no definitive way to determine if a woman was barren or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even in the case of a barren wife, it is not permissible to engage in sexual relations with other men. Would you continue to refer to her as a &quot;pure woman&quot; who is suitable for a &quot;pure religious husband&quot; like yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2nd Excuse: The Prophet didn't 'stone her to death while no 4 witnesses were present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize the tactics employed by some Islamic apologists. They initially frame the issue as &quot;stoning her to death&quot; and then proceed to defend Muhammad by suggesting that he could not carry out the punishment without the presence of four witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the focus should not be on stoning her to death but rather on simply divorcing and separating from her. For that, the husband did not require four witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet himself advised the man in this hadith to divorce her, indicating that it was a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the man expressed his desire to continue enjoying his wife's physical beauty, the Prophet allowed him to satisfy his lust with a wife who engaged in fornication with other men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same tradition is found in the Fiqh rulings as well. It is mentioned in the Fiqh book of Imam Hanifa (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220714191915/http://sachaai.com/15/images/Articles/dur_al_mukhtar_v2_p2511.jpg&quot;&gt;Dur-e-Mukhtar, vol. 2, Kitab-ul-Nikah&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It is permissible to wed a woman, who fornicates. Even if man has himself seen her doing fornication, still he can marry her ... and what Allah said in the Quran {The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.3&quot;&gt;24:3&lt;/a&gt;)}, then the answer to this objection is this, that this verse has been abrogated from this verse { فَانْكِحُوْا  مَا  طَابَ  لَكُمْ  then marry the women that seem good to you (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.3&quot;&gt;4:3&lt;/a&gt;)}. And the proof of this abrogation is this tradition, where a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ), and said: My wife does not prevent&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the hand of a man&lt;strong&gt; who touches her (i.e. who does sex with her)&lt;/strong&gt;. He (the Prophet) said: Divorce her. He then said: I am afraid my inner self may covet her. He (the Prophet) said: Then enjoy her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/4&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, 2049&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ), and said: My wife does not prevent the hand of a man who touches her (i.e. who fornicates with her). He said: Divorce her. He then said: I am afraid my inner self may covet her. He said: Then (keep) enjoying her (as your wife).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Al-Albani)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for Ibn 'Abbas, this same hadith has also been narrated by Hisham (the slave of Muhammad) and companion Jabir bin Abdullah (جابر بن عبدالله).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir recorded it from Hisham and Jabir bin Abdullah Ansari (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/3597_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AC-%D9%A5/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_0?pageno=342&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ومنهم هشام مولى &lt;span title=&quot;الرسول الأكرم محمد بن عبد الله صلى الله عليه وآله&quot;&gt;النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم&lt;/span&gt; قال &lt;span title=&quot;محمد بن سعد&quot;&gt;محمد بن سعد&lt;/span&gt;: أنبأنا سليمان بن عبيد الله الرقي، أنبأنا &lt;span title=&quot;محمد بن أيوب&quot;&gt;محمد بن أيوب&lt;/span&gt; الرقي، عن سفيان، عن &lt;span title=&quot;عبد الكريم&quot;&gt;عبد الكريم&lt;/span&gt;، عن أبي الزبير عن هشام مولى &lt;span title=&quot;الرسول الأكرم محمد بن عبد الله صلى الله عليه وآله&quot;&gt;رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم&lt;/span&gt;. قال: جاء رجل فقال يا رسول الله إن امرأتي لا تدفع &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;يد لامس&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;، قال &quot; طلقها &quot; قال: إنها تعجبني، قال &quot; فتمتع بها &quot; قال ابن منده وقد رواه جماعة عن &lt;span title=&quot;سفيان الثوري&quot;&gt;سفيان الثوري&lt;/span&gt;، عن أبي الزبير، عن مولى &lt;span title=&quot;بنو هاشم&quot;&gt;بني هاشم&lt;/span&gt; عن &lt;span title=&quot;الرسول الأكرم محمد بن عبد الله صلى الله عليه وآله&quot;&gt;النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم&lt;/span&gt; ولم يسمه. ورواه &lt;span title=&quot;عبيد الله بن عمرو&quot;&gt;عبيد الله بن عمرو&lt;/span&gt; عن &lt;span title=&quot;عبد الكريم&quot;&gt;عبد الكريم&lt;/span&gt; عن أبي الزبير عن جابر.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot; A man came and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, my wife does not repel my touch.' He said, 'Divorce her.' The man said, 'But I love her.' He said, 'Then enjoy her.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: In this hadith, the phrase &quot;يَدَ لاَمِسٍ&quot; is used, which literally means &quot;to touch.&quot; However, according to Arabic language usage, it carries the meaning of &quot;to engage in sexual intercourse.&quot; The same term &quot;to touch&quot; has been employed with the same connotation of &quot;engaging in sexual intercourse&quot; in the Quran itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.237&quot;&gt;2:237&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَإِن طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; تَمَسُّوهُنَّ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if ye divorce them before &lt;strong&gt;touching them (i.e. doing intercourse)&lt;/strong&gt;, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (Is due to them)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Muslim Scholars are unanimous that “touching” here means to engage in sexual intercourse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Ibn Kathir writes in the commentary under this verse 2:237, that it means &quot;penetration دخول&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=2&amp;amp;tAyahNo=237&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

Truly, Allah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merely touching a woman does not require one to take a bath. However, it is sexual intercourse that leads to a state of Janaba, indicating sexual impurity, for which a bath is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The contradiction between the Quran and Muhammad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;highlightable&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #f8cac6;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Contradiction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Muhammad emphasized the importance of modesty, decency, chastity, and the practice of Hijab, discouraging interactions with the opposite gender, and prescribing the severe punishment of stoning for adultery. On the other hand, Muhammad instructed his companion to continue enjoying his beautiful wife, even in the event of her engaging in adultery with other men (companions?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #013b01; background-color: #bfedd2;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Contradiction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the incident of IFK, three companions testified against 'Aisha's character. However, Muhammad desired to clear 'Aisha of the accusation, as it indirectly challenged his claim of prophethood. Consequently, he claimed the revelation of the following verses, which were intended to serve as evidence of 'Aisha's innocence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.3&quot;&gt;24:3&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٱلزَّانِى لَا يَنكِحُ إِلَّا زَانِيَةً أَوْ مُشْرِكَةً وَٱلزَّانِيَةُ لَا يَنكِحُهَآ إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.26&quot;&gt;24:26&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٱلْخَبِيثَٰتُ لِلْخَبِيثِينَ وَٱلْخَبِيثُونَ لِلْخَبِيثَٰتِ ۖ وَٱلطَّيِّبَٰتُ لِلطَّيِّبِينَ وَٱلطَّيِّبُونَ لِلطَّيِّبَٰتِ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ مُبَرَّءُونَ مِمَّا يَقُولُونَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impure women are for impure men and impure men for impure women, and pure women are for pure men and pure men for pure women. They are free from those scandals which the slanderers utter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in instructing his companions to continue deriving sexual pleasure from his beautiful wife, Muhammad seemingly overlooked the fact that during the incident of IFK, he had already declared that pure men are meant for pure women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this occurrence proves that there exists no Allah in the heavens, and Muhammad, being human, made this mistake due to forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it is up to you to decide whether a religion with such significant contradictions can truly originate from a divine being in the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_10la _10lg&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0007ff; background-color: #bfedd2;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem; background-color: #bfedd2;&quot;&gt;3rd Contradiction: That companion was a cuckold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/nasai:2562&quot;&gt;Sunan Nisai, 2562&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Messenger of Allah said: &quot;There are three at whom Allah will not look on the Day of Resurrection: The one who disobeys his parents, the woman who imitates men in her outward appearance, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and the cuckold (i.e. a man whose wife is sexually unfaithful)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It serves as another evidence of Muhammad's contradiction. He expressed one viewpoint on a certain matter and contradicted himself on another. Being a human, he was susceptible to making such mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The issue of Parentage of the child&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect to consider is the issue of parentage, which becomes exceedingly complex if the woman is conceiving a child from her husband or other men who engage in sexual relations with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in this case, Muhammad seemed to overlook the fact that he had mandated severe punishments for unmarried couples, all in the name of safeguarding the child's lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Muslims are questioned about why Islam imposes such draconian punishments like stoning to death, they proudly assert that it is to protect the child's parentage, preventing them from living under the same roof as non-Mahram siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, do these Muslims realize that a child born to such a beautiful woman from another man is considered non-Mahram to the husband's other wives and daughters? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;Yet, the husband is obligated to bestow his name upon that child and raise him alongside his other wives and daughters in the same household.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that Muslims are unable to perceive these logical contradictions within their religion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1st excuse from Islamic apologists: This hadith is only about a barren women &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Islamic apologist stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abu Dawud recorded this hadith under the chapter titled &quot;Prohibition of Marrying Women Who Do Not Give Birth.&quot; This implies that there would be no issue of parentage while continuing to enjoy her as a wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no explicit indication within this hadith itself that it solely pertains to barren women. The absence of any mention of barren women is consistent across all versions of this hadith, including the one narrated by Ibn Abbas. Therefore, it holds no significance that Abu Dawud recorded it under a chapter concerning barren women. No angel came to Abu Dawud directly to inform him that this hadith exclusively applies to barren women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we consider this logically, there are many couples who do not conceive despite attempting for numerous years. However, after several years, the wife does become pregnant. In that era, there was no definitive way to determine if a woman was barren or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even in the case of a barren wife, it is not permissible to engage in sexual relations with other men. Would you continue to refer to her as a &quot;pure woman&quot; who is suitable for a &quot;pure religious husband&quot; like yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2nd Excuse: The Prophet didn't 'stone her to death while no 4 witnesses were present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize the tactics employed by some Islamic apologists. They initially frame the issue as &quot;stoning her to death&quot; and then proceed to defend Muhammad by suggesting that he could not carry out the punishment without the presence of four witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the focus should not be on stoning her to death but rather on simply divorcing and separating from her. For that, the husband did not require four witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet himself advised the man in this hadith to divorce her, indicating that it was a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the man expressed his desire to continue enjoying his wife's physical beauty, the Prophet allowed him to satisfy his lust with a wife who engaged in fornication with other men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same tradition is found in the Fiqh rulings as well. It is mentioned in the Fiqh book of Imam Hanifa (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220714191915/http://sachaai.com/15/images/Articles/dur_al_mukhtar_v2_p2511.jpg&quot;&gt;Dur-e-Mukhtar, vol. 2, Kitab-ul-Nikah&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It is permissible to wed a woman, who fornicates. Even if man has himself seen her doing fornication, still he can marry her ... and what Allah said in the Quran {The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.3&quot;&gt;24:3&lt;/a&gt;)}, then the answer to this objection is this, that this verse has been abrogated from this verse { فَانْكِحُوْا  مَا  طَابَ  لَكُمْ  then marry the women that seem good to you (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.3&quot;&gt;4:3&lt;/a&gt;)}. And the proof of this abrogation is this tradition, where a man came to the Prophet (ﷺ), and said: My wife does not prevent&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the hand of a man&lt;strong&gt; who touches her (i.e. who does sex with her)&lt;/strong&gt;. He (the Prophet) said: Divorce her. He then said: I am afraid my inner self may covet her. He (the Prophet) said: Then enjoy her.&lt;/div&gt;

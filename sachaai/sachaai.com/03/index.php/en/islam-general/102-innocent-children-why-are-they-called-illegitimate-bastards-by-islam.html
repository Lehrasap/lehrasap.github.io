<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId778565"></a>Summary:</h2>
<p>Muhammad ordered that an illegitimate child will not belong to his father, but he will belong to the person on whose bed he is born, while the father has only a stone and he will have no connection with the child (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6817">Sahih Bukhari, 6817</a>)</p>
<p>Can Muslims tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the fault of this innocent child to whom Islam first declares "Wald-ul-Haram" (Bastard), and then</li>
<li>This innocent child will not be able to get the name of his father, while Sharia considers him a bastard.</li>
<li>This child cannot get the love of his father as Islam bans his father from even visiting him.</li>
<li>Due to their status as a bastard, the child receives no support or assistance from their father in terms of upbringing and education.</li>
<li>The illegitimate child will not get even any financial support from his father.</li>
<li>The child is excluded from any inheritance rights from their father.</li>
<li>If the child is a girl, she is considered a non-Mahram for her father and stepbrothers, depriving her of fatherly and brotherly love.</li>
<li>Islam not only separated this innocent child from his father but then Islam may also take away his mother from him by stoning (killing) her in the name of adultery.  Thus, Islam also took away from this child the love and support of his mother too. Now he is totally alone to face all the hardships of this world.</li>
<li>An illegitimate girl cannot marry without the permission of the Ruler, as her father cannot be her guardian.</li>
</ul>
<p>Human logic questions the rationale behind these Islamic practices: </p>
<ol>
<li>Consensual sexual activity between a man and a woman should not result in physical punishment.</li>
<li>If punishment is deemed necessary, it should be directed towards the responsible individuals rather than punishing an innocent child with the label of "Walad-ul-Haram" (Bastard).</li>
<li>Islam's punishment directly targets the child, causing undue harm to an innocent life.</li>

<p>These rulings came from this Hadith of Muhammad:</p>
<p><a href="https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/82700">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>أنَّ رسولَ اللَّهِ صلَّى اللَّهُ عليهِ وسلَّمَ قَضى أنَّ كلَّ مُستَلحقٍ يُستَلحَقُ بعدَ أبيهِ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ ، ادَّعاهُ ورثتُهُ من بعدِهِ ، فقَضى : إن كانَ من أَمةٍ يملِكُها يومَ أصابَها فقد لَحقَ بمنِ استلحقَهُ ، وليسَ لَهُ فيما قسمَ قبلَهُ منَ الميراثِ شيءٌ ، وما أدرَكَ مِن ميراثٍ لم يُقسَمْ ، فلَهُ نصيبُهُ ، ولا يَلحقُ إذا كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ أنكرَهُ ، وإن كانَ من أَمةٍ لا يملِكُها ، أو من حرَّةٍ عاهرَ بِها ، فإنَّهُ لا يَلحقُ ولا يرثُ ، وإن كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ هوَ الَّذي ادَّعاهُ ، وَهوَ ولدُ زنًا لأَهْلِ أمِّهِ ، من كانوا ، حرَّةً ، أو أمةً</p>
<p>"The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ruled that every child belongs to the one who claims him after his father. His heirs can claim him after his death. He ruled that if the child belongs to a slave whom he possessed on the day the child was born, then the child belongs to the one who claimed him, and he has no share in the inheritance that was divided before his claim. However, he will have a share in any remaining inheritance that has not been divided. But if the father to whom he is attributed denies him (i.e. his parentage), the the child will not joined to the heirs. If the child belongs to a slave whom he does not possess, or to a free woman with whom he committed adultery, then the child will not join the heirs and will not inherit him, even if the one to whom he was attributed is the one who claimed paternity, since he was a child of fornication whether his mother was free or a slave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grade: <strong>Sahih</strong> (<a href="https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/82700">Shakir</a>)</p>
<p>In a tradition in Sahih Bukhari, Muhammad said (<a href="http://www.hadithurdu.com/01/1-3-1756/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>الْوَلَدُ لِلْفِرَاشِ وَلِلْعَاهِرِ الْحَجَرُ</p>
<p>The Prophet said: The (illegitimate) child belongs to the owner of the bed, and for the fornicator (biological father) there is only stone (i.e. nothing).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Islamic scholars explained this hadith as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The biological father of an illegitimate child will have no legal or parental rights over the child. The father cannot give his name to the child, participate in their upbringing, or have any inheritance ties with the child. In the case of an illegitimate daughter, she will be considered "Na-Mahram" (non-Mahram) to her father, requiring her to observe Hijab in his presence.</li>
<li>If an unmarried woman gives birth, the child will solely carry the mother's name.</li>
<li>If a woman accepts adultery, then the mother will be stoned.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A detailed form of this hadith is also present in Sahih Bukhari, which explains this issue in detail:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4303">Sahih Bukhari, 4303</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated 'Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) Utba bin Abi Waqqas entrusted (his son) to his brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas saying, "The son of the slave-girl of Zam'a is my (illegal) son, take him into your custody." So during the year of the Conquest (of Mecca), Sad took the boy and said, "This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me." 'Abu bin Zam's got up and said, "He is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father and was born on my father's bed." Then both of them came to Allah's Apostle and Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me."<br>Then 'Abu bin Zam'a got up and said, "This is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father." Allah's Apostle said, "O Abu bin Zam'a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born), and for the adulterer is the stone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The questions that arise in our minds are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The child is undoubtedly innocent, even if they are born out of wedlock.</li>
<li>However, why should a child be punished by being deprived of their father's name?</li>
<li>If the child takes the mother's name, society automatically identifies them as a bastard.</li>
<li>Additionally, the child is denied the love of their father, as meeting or seeing them is not allowed. For a daughter, this situation makes her a non-Mahram to her father and stepbrothers, necessitating her to observe Hijab.</li>
<li>The child receives no upbringing or financial support from the father and inherits nothing from him. Instead, they only inherit from the mother. This raises the question of whether it is fair for the child to be deprived of their father's inheritance.</li>
<li>If the mother is also stoned to death due to adultery, the child loses both biological parents and their love and care. This innocent child is bound to face numerous hardships, even though it was not his fault.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId119860"></a>According to Islam, a child will still be considered a "Bastard" even if the mother was raped</h2>
<p>This raises questions about the Divine Wisdom behind such a ruling. Even if the mother was a victim of rape and unable to provide four eyewitnesses to prove the crime, she would face lashes as punishment, and her child would also be labeled as illegitimate under Sharia law. The child would only be recognized by their mother's name, and she would be compelled to bear all the expenses of the child alone. Meanwhile, the man responsible for the rape is absolved of any responsibility to financially support the child, as per Sharia law.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId528062"></a>The offspring of slave women often fell victim to the ruling that declared them illegitimate bastards</h2>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<p>A Muslim master used to rape the slave woman in a "<strong>Temporary"</strong> sexual relationship and then sold her to another master, or gave her to his brother or to his slave, and all of them raped her one by one. </p>
<p>Consequently, challenges arose regarding how to handle situations where doubts emerged about the biological parentage of the child in such cases.</p>
<p>Mohammad devised a solution wherein the owner had the privilege to deny the parentage of his own child, thus declaring the own child to be an illegitimate BASTARD (Arabic: Walad-ul-Haram). </p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://dorar.net/hadith/sharh/82700">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>أنَّ رسولَ اللَّهِ صلَّى اللَّهُ عليهِ وسلَّمَ قَضى أنَّ كلَّ مُستَلحقٍ يُستَلحَقُ بعدَ أبيهِ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ ، ادَّعاهُ ورثتُهُ من بعدِهِ ، فقَضى : إن كانَ من أَمةٍ يملِكُها يومَ أصابَها فقد لَحقَ بمنِ استلحقَهُ ، وليسَ لَهُ فيما قسمَ قبلَهُ منَ الميراثِ شيءٌ ، وما أدرَكَ مِن ميراثٍ لم يُقسَمْ ، فلَهُ نصيبُهُ ، ولا يَلحقُ إذا كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ أنكرَهُ ، وإن كانَ من أَمةٍ لا يملِكُها ، أو من حرَّةٍ عاهرَ بِها ، فإنَّهُ لا يَلحقُ ولا يرثُ ، وإن كانَ أبوهُ الَّذي يُدعَى لَهُ هوَ الَّذي ادَّعاهُ ، وَهوَ ولدُ زنًا لأَهْلِ أمِّهِ ، من كانوا ، حرَّةً ، أو أمةً</p>
<p>"The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ruled that every child belongs to the one who claims him after his father. His heirs can claim him after his death. He ruled that if the child belongs to a slave whom he possessed on the day the child was born, then the child belongs to the one who claimed him, and he has no share in the inheritance that was divided before his claim. However, he will have a share in any remaining inheritance that has not been divided. But if the father to whom he is attributed denies him (i.e. his parentage), the the child will not joined to the heirs. If the child belongs to a slave whom he does not possess, or to a free woman with whom he committed adultery, then the child will not join the heirs and will not inherit him, even if the one to whom he was attributed is the one who claimed paternity, since he was a child of fornication whether his mother was free or a slave.</p>

</div>
<p>In situations where the father disowns his own child from a slave woman, the child becomes enslaved to their father. Consequently, the father gains the ability to sell his own son or daughter in the slave market for profit.</p>
<p>Mercy!  It's distressing to contemplate such a situation.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId446342"></a>Perhaps the Slave Mothers suffered the MOST:</h2>
<p>We also really feel sorry for the slave women of the past centuries in the Islamic caliphates. They had to go through 2 additional steps of hardships. According to Sharia rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was the Master's choice to accept children from their slave girls as his own children or to deny them his name as the father. In later cases, those children got the name of their mother only and became illegitimate children.</li>
<li>And the master was allowed to separate the children from the slave woman when the children got 2 teeth and sell his own son/daughter in the slave markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (also known as the younger Imam Malik) wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf">link 1</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117184347/http://www.dhspriory.org/kenny/RISALA.htm">link 2</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="western">ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر<br>A slave-mother and her baby cannot be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) till the baby get two molar teeth (The two molar teeth alway appear in a pair, at the age of 6 to 8 months)</blockquote>
<p>The anguish experienced by a mother is indescribable when her six-month-old baby is forcibly taken away from her and sold in the slave market.</p>
<p>Free women got at least the right to live with their illegitimate children, but just imagine the poor slave mothers whose children were labelled as Bastards for the whole of their life, and then even separated from her after she had fostered the child her milk for 6 months. </p>

<p><strong>Here is one letter from a Muslim father Ali Smith:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I am a muslim man since I was born alhumdulillah but I went through a rough patch in my life and I caused zinnah with a non muslim woman out of wedlock. I have now turned to Allah and have been asking for repentance. I have recently found that the person I was in a relationship with is pregnant and wants to keep the child.<br>My family do not know about my situation and I do not want them to know. In islam, am I allowed to not know this child and not pay child support.<br>-Ali Smith</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Now look at this reply from Sister Aria:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I feel so sorry for this child who is going to be born in a world where his father does not want to be a father.<br>Islam is a wonderful religion teaching you about to be good, responsible,respect parents and other people, charity.......<br>Thinking about the last word: charity and help others. How are you ever going to be a good muslim when you do not want to provide some money for child support to your own flesh and blood.<br>This child is sinless even though he is born out of wedlock. Just become a mature man and learn how to be responsible not be more preocupied how to avoid to be involved in his life physically and financially or keep him away from knowing is grandparents.<br>If you start you life with a lie you will live in a lie your entire life.</i></p>

My sons mother came to me in November and told me she couldn't get my sons u.s. Passport until I sign authorizing it. My parents said not to sign. My ex is really angry with me because now she has to go to court and spend money getting full custody of my son so she can get the passport. She wants to move to Dubai for a job opportunity that's why my son needs his passport. I told her I would sign the paper but for 5 months I just lied to her , now she's very angry with me.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId522254"></a>Problems that are occurring for innocent daughters/sons due to this so-called "Divine Wisdom"</h2>
<p>We wonder what is the <b>wisdom </b>of All-Wise Allah behind all this. There are so many problems occurring for the daughters and sons in the name of being Bastards (Wald-ul-Haram). For example, look at this fatwa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Fatwa No : 325114 (<a href="http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=325114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>).<br>Telling an illegitimate daughter truth about her birth<br><br>Question:<br>I am a mother who has a child out of wedlock who vaguely remembers her "biological father" when he was around. My question is: do I have to tell my daughter that she was born out of wedlock? What if she asks what happened to him, and if so, when and how does one go about explaining it?<br><br>Answer:<br>You are not Islamically obliged to tell your daughter that she was born out of wedlock (even if she gets your name and not of her father), and there is no benefit for her in doing so. Rather, it is totally against her interest.<br>If she happened to ask about her father, you are allowed to resort to <b>tawriyah </b>(saying something which has more than one meaning and intending a meaning different from what the listener is likely to understand). Verily, tawriyah is a legitimate way to avoid lying. You can tell her, for instance, that her father has passed away with the intention of meaning that a “legitimate” father does not exist.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One wonders how this could protect the daughter while:</p>
<ol>
<li>By carrying the name of her mother (and not her father), she and the whole society already know that she is a BASTARD child.</li>
<li><strong>Tawriyah:</strong> It seems to be another name for Islamic Taqqiyyah.</li>
</ol>
<p>But we are afraid that telling a lie is again not going to solve the problems as she is carrying the name of her mother while the passing away of her legitimate father does not stop one from carrying his name.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId845242"></a>Allah claims that an illegitimate daughter/son is a bigger evil and sinner than his/her parents</h2>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3963">Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 3963:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، ‏‏‏‏‏‏قَالَ:‏‏‏‏ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ:‏‏‏‏ "وَلَدُ الزِّنَا شَرُّ الثَّلَاثَةِ"، ‏‏‏‏‏‏وقَالَ أَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ:‏‏‏‏ لَأَنْ أُمَتِّعَ بِسَوْطٍ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِنْ أَنْ أَعْتِقَ وَلَدَ زِنْيَةٍ.<br>The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: <b>The child of fornication is worst of the three</b> (among father, mother &amp; child). Abu Hurayrah said that<strong> he prefers to give dirt as alms in path of Allah then freeing such illegitimate slave (due to his/her being even bigger evil and sinner than his/her fornicating parents)</strong>.<br>Imam Albani graded this Hadith as "Sahih" (<a href="https://dorar.net/h/62ed0c7cd66b093496caf211775e3f47" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercy!</p>
<p>This Hadith raises the question of wisdom behind making this innocent child highly susceptible to becoming evil later in life.</p>
<p>Some Muslim scholars argue that the reason for this possibility lies in the child's lack of education and upbringing by the father. However, this argument is difficult to accept.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there arises a counter-argument that it is Islamic Sharia itself which initially deprives this innocent child of the education and upbringing by the father. Consequently, if the child does become the worst among them, the responsibility ultimately falls upon Islam.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId167989"></a>Sunni Imams: An illegitimate Child cannot lead a congregational prayer</h2>
<p>All 4 Fiqh Imams (i.e. Malik, Abu Hanifa, Shafi'i and Ahmed bin Hanbal) say that it is not allowed for an illegitimate child to lead a congregational prayer (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200108132848/https://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/PrintFatwa.php?lang=E&amp;Id=88469&amp;lang=E&amp;Id=88469">Reference: Biggest English Fatwa Website Islamweb.org</a>). Although Imam Ahmed allows it conditionally if it is established that he is really sound in religion (while this condition does not apply to legitimate children, and they can lead prayers even if they are not sound in religion). </p>
<p>The renowned Hanafi jurist, Imam Ibn Abidin presented the following excuse (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200108131733/https://seekersguidance.org/answers/hanafi-fiqh/can-an-illegitimate-son-lead-salat/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is due to the fact that he [i.e. the illegitimate] does not [normally] have a father to raise him, train him and teach him, hence ignorance (Jahl) overcomes him [and thus, he should not lead the prayer due to his ignorance].” (Radd al-Mukhtar ala ‘l-Durr al-Mukhtar, 1/562)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is perplexing to consider how this lame excuse holds any ground when it is Islam itself that initially deprives this innocent child of the education and upbringing provided by the father. Consequently, Islam itself keeps such a child in ignorance.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId13167"></a>If a mother was non-Muslim at the time of birth, then the illegitimate child will also not inherit from the mother</h2>
<p>Please read the complete <a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/89082/status-of-child-born-out-of-wedlock">Fatwa here (link).</a> According to this Fatwa:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the mother was non-Muslim at the time of birth, then the illegitimate child will also not inherit the Mother.</li>
<li>Even if the mother accepts Islam later, still the illegitimate child will not inherit her.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please don't forget that the divine Allah has already deprived the child of the inheritance from his father. And now Allah is depriving the child of inheritance from his mother too.</p>
<p>If a Muslim father has a child with a Western mother, and that child, despite being considered illegitimate, chooses to embrace Islam, he/she will be deprived of any inheritance from both the father and the mother.</p>
<p>And all this is done while, according to Islam, that child is illegitimate.</p>
<p>What type of "divine Wisdom" and "divine Justice" is this?</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId950183"></a>A father can even marry his illegitimate daughter</h2>
<p>According to Imam Shafi'i and Imam Malik, a father can even marry his illegitimate daughter as she is non-Mahram to him.</p>
<p>Book Al-Fiqh ala al-Madhahib al-Arba'a by al-Jazairi (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161218124532/http://islamport.com/d/2/fqh/1/29/337.html?zoom_highlightsub=%ED%CA%D2%E6%CC+%C8%E4%CA%E5">link</a>):</p>
<p>هذا ويجوز للرجل أن يتزوج بنته المخلوقة من مائه زنا فإذا زنا بامرأة وحملت منه سفاحا وجاءت ببنت فإنها لا تحرم عليه لأن ماء الزنا لا حرمة له وكما تحل له تحل لأصوله وفروعه ولكن يكره له نكاحها بخلاف الأم الزانية فإنها كسائر الأمهات في الحرمة على أبنائهن لأن نسبه ثابت منها ويتوارثان</p>
<p>It is permissible for a man to marry his biological daughter if she was (conceived) through fornication, if he committed fornication with a woman and she got pregnant from him and gave birth to a girl then the girl is not unmarriable for him because the sperm released through fornication doesn’t make someone unmarriable, as she is marriable for him, she is also marriable for his ancestors and progeny.</p>
<p>Al-Mughni, by Imam Ibn Qadama, Volume 7 page 485 (<a href="http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/الكتب/1004_المغني-عبد-الله-بن-قدامه-ج-٧/الصفحة_485">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ويحرم على الرجل نكاح بنته من الزنى ، وأخته ، وبنت ابنه ، وبنت بنته ، وبنت أخيه ، وأخته من الزنى . وهو قول عامة الفقهاء . وقال مالك ، والشافعي في المشهور من مذهبه : يجوز ذلك كله ; لأنها أجنبية منه ولا تنسب إليه شرعا</p>
<p>It’s not permissible for the man to marry his daughter born through adultery, or her sister, granddaughter, niece and sister and this is the statement of the scholars, but Malik and Shafiyee said that it is permissible because she is alien and does not relate to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These Fatwas emerged due to the inherent corruption within the foundation (i.e., the religion) itself.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId645657"></a>An illegitimate girl cannot marry without the permission of the Ruler</h2>
<p>The father of an illegitimate girl cannot be her guardian. Actually, an illegitimate girl has absolutely no male guardian, as she gets only the name of her mother. Thus, the Ruler will automatically become her guardian, and she cannot marry without the permission of the Ruler.</p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId352807"></a>Shia Madhab and injustices against Illegitimate Children:</h2>
<p>I have No Words to say against these great injustices in Shia Madhab against Illegitimate Children. Please read it yourself on their biggest Shia Website www.al-islam.org (<a href="https://www.al-islam.org/philosophy-islamic-laws-nasir-makarim-shirazi-jafar-subhani/question-15-why-illegitimate-children">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: </p>
<p><em>Why Illegitimate Children Are Kept Away From Some Posts like Jurist, Leader, Judge etc.?</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p><em>A child does not know his father, grandfather, grandmother and relatives (because Sharia does not allow the father to give child his name and to play any role in upbringing of the child). And (thus) generally many ethical, psychological, social, training, family, financially and sentimental defects come into existence because of it ...</em></p>
<p><em>Inheritance is the base for a person's future and makes the personality of an individual and prepares the ground for them for their good or bad fortune.</em></p>
<p><em>From these points we can derive the following results:</em></p>
<p><em>Illegitimate children inherit bad manners, breaking of laws and sins from their parents. For them the ground for sins and crime is more feasible. As compared to others they are more prepared for sins and if they personally get wrong training or if the environment is not good, then it is enough for them that their polluted soul, like sparks beneath the ash become fire and burn their good fortune.</em></p>
<p><em>As for the question about social posts for illegitimate persons, it is a logical precaution for the protection of social good on the basis of whatever is said above about their psychological state ...</em></p>
<p><em>When an illegitimate child is prepared to perform his duties and able to do work of training, if his deeds are good he will get rewards for it and if he does bad he will be punished.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Although the rebellious nature of illegitimate children (which have more interest and are more inclined to break the laws and commit sins) makes it difficult for them to avoid sin, and it is also difficult for them to perform their duties,</strong> but if they go against their desires and follow the orders of Almighty and right principles they will be given the best of the rewards ...</em></p>
<p><em><strong>In other words those children who are illegitimately born are like those children who are born to the parents having diseases (T.B, and sexual disorders). These children have more chances of contracting these diseases</strong> and if they are not cured as early as possible they are more likely to get these diseases.</em></p>
<p><em>Like the ill parents, illegitimate children are also prepared to break the laws and fall into crime if their training and studies are not provided in the right environment and healthy intentions. It is possible they may fall into a great depth and ally with the criminals. For those reasons, in order to protect the social cause, precautions should be taken that they remain away from some posts.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Can you ever agree with this Wisdom of Shia Madhab? </p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>One excuse put forth by Shia scholars is that these illegitimate children are more susceptible to engaging in crimes and sins due to the lack of education from their fathers. However, the reality is that it is Islamic Sharia itself that initially deprives these innocent children of receiving education from their fathers, under the label of being bastards.</p>
<p>Please see here a lot of Shia Ahadith and Fatwas that an <a href="http://ijtihadnet.com/illegitimate-children-not-allow-lead-congregational-prayer/">illegitimate child is not allowed to even lead a congregational prayer (link)</a></p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId213534"></a>Imran Khan and his alleged daughter Tyrian White:</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../images/Imran-Khan-love-child1.jpg" alt="Daughter of Imran khan" width="381" height="375" loading="lazy" data-path="https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/en/islam-general/local-images:/Imran-Khan-love-child1.jpg"></p>
<p>An Islamic society finds itself entangled in contradictions. People blame Imran Khan for not acknowledging his alleged daughter, Tyrian White, by giving her his name and fatherly love. However, the criticism should be directed towards Islam, not Imran Khan, as it is Islam that prohibits him from expressing fatherly love to his daughter. In an Islamic society, direct criticism of Islam is often avoided, leading Imran Khan to bear the burden of actions he didn't commit but are dictated by Islamic teachings.</p>
<p>Credit should be given to Imran Khan for not abandoning Tyrian and instead bringing her into the care of Jemima (his ex-wife) and his other sons. This act highlights that, without the constraints of Islamic teachings, Imran Khan might have taken full responsibility for his daughter.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Imran Khan's behavior also displays contradictions. While he proclaims his complete belief in Allah and His Sharia, he contradicts Sharia by taking care of Tyrian. Such contradictions can be seen as hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Under Sharia, it is considered a crime for Tyrian to reside under the same roof as her stepbrothers, as they are non-Mahrams. According to Sharia law, the punishment for this crime would be to lash Tyrian and her brothers.</p>
<p>These rulings of Islamic Sharia appear to lack any discernible Divine Wisdom.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId506875"></a>A Remarkable Achievement of the West: Eradicating the Suffering of Innocent Children Labeled as Illegitimate Bastards </h2>
<p>The modern non-religious West has not only abolished slavery worldwide but has also done a great favour to poor and innocent illegitimate children. And this favour is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complete eradication of the stigma of being an illegitimate bastard from innocent children.</li>
<li>Ensuring that these innocent children are granted EQUAL human rights.</li>
<li>Providing them with the love, upbringing, name, support, and inheritance they rightfully deserve.</li>
<li>Putting an end to the barbaric punishments associated with fornication, thereby saving the lives of countless innocent children. In some Islamic countries like Pakistan, mothers are tragically forced to kill their newborn children and dispose of their bodies in plastic bags in garbage dumps, all in an attempt to escape the horrific punishment of lashing or stoning (Please read our article:<a href="58-.html"> Killing of Newborn Babies by Their Own Mothers Due to the Fear of Draconian Islamic Punishments</a>). Conversely, in Western countries, mothers no longer live in fear of such brutal punishments, and as a result, they don't resort to such tragic actions but rather hand over their newborns to the appropriate authorities.</li>

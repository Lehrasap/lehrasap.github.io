        <p>Religious individuals claim their faith has a monopoly on morals. However, we frequently observe these same individuals deceiving the public and using unethical methods to propagate their beliefs. Modern Islamic apologists, in particular, are busy distorting Islamic texts through incorrect translations and other means. This dishonesty is unfortunate.</p>
<h2>Not even 10 Jews believed in the prophethood of Muhammad</h2>
<p>The Bible contains several passages that highlight the phenomenon of divine acceptance of a person's sacrificial offering through the appearance of a mysterious fire that consumes the offering. These instances can be found in verses such as Judges 6:20-21, 13:19-20, and 2 Chronicles 7:1-2.</p>
<p>Actually, Muhammad had already made a mistake, and he had also previously confirmed this method of the miracle of fire in the Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/5.27">5:27</a>, in the story of Adam and his sons, where a fire appeared and consumed the offering of one son who sacrificed a sheep.</p>
<p>Consequently, when Muhammad asserted his prophethood, the Jews asked him to provide proof through the manifestation of a miracle, specifically the fire consuming his offering.</p>
<p>Muhammad found himself unable to dismiss this demand outright, as he already acknowledged it in the story of Adam in the Quran.</p>
<p>However, Muhammad resorted to a different approach, offering a new excuse. He accepted the validity of the miracle involving the fire accepting the offering, but he refused to showcase this miracle. He justified his inability to show this miracle by accusing the Jews of Medina that their forefathers sinned by killing previous prophets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quran<a href="https://quranx.com/3.183?context=3"> 3:183</a>:</p>
<p>They (the Jews) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in any messenger <strong>unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire</strong> (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: <strong>why then did ye slay them</strong>, if ye speak the truth?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, this excuse by Allah/Muhammad was lame, as it is unjust to punish individuals for the sins of their ancestors. As a result, not even 10 Jews believed in the prophethood of Muhammad. </p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Note:</strong> The Islamic Translators of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim added these words in parenthesis on their own "<span style="background-color: #fcff01;"><em><strong>(amongst their chiefs)"</strong></em></span></span> or "<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;"><em><strong>Scholars of the Jews"</strong></em></span></span> It is a Distortion (TEHRIF) case, while these words have nothing to do with the original tradition, which is talking about normal 10 Jews, and not about any of their chiefs/scholars. Islamic preachers are compelled to do this TEHRIF (distortion) while it was a shame that not even 10 Jews believed in Muhammad and considered him a liar. </p>
<p>This distortion by Islamic preachers is utterly shameful and shows how dishonest they are and how ashamed they are of the truth.</p>
<p>It seems Muhammad repeated this statement multiple times, and his companion 'Auf ibn Malik is also a witness to a similar statement from him. </p>

<p>But the Jews of Medina still refused to accept him as a true prophet, and that was the point where Muhammad's enmity and hatred started against the Jews:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, Muhammad changed the Qibla once again from Bait-ul-Muqqadas to Ka'ba in Mecca. </li>
<li>Then he started openly threatening the Jews to accept Islam, otherwise, they would be expelled from Medina, and he would snatch away all of their lands by force. </li>

<p>Yes, that was the whole argument of Muhammad: "...<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="color: #843fa1;"><strong><span style="color: #e67e23;">that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle (only)</span></strong></span></span> ..."</p>

The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." Prophet said: <span style="color: #e67e23;"><em><strong>All the graze-lands belong to Allah and his prophet.</strong></em></span></span></p>

<p>Later Muhammad's anger and hatred against the Jews went so high that he was no more satisfied by expelling them from Medina, but he wanted to expel them from the whole Arab peninsula. It was due to the reason that it was a shame for him that he was claiming himself to be the promised prophet of the Jews, but the Jews were telling people that he was not that promised prophet. Muhammad didn't want the Jews to tell this to others, thus he wanted to expel them from the whole Arabian peninsula. </p>

<h2>Hadith of abusing Kafir to suck the clitoris of his female goddess al-Lat</h2>
<p>There is a Hadith in Sahih Bukhari, where Abu Bakr abused the ambassador of Quraysh, by telling him to "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Go and suck the clitoris of al-Lat (the female goddess)</span></strong>". Muhammad didn't stop Abu Bakr from this blasphemy but made such abuse a part of Islamic Sharia by keeping quiet about it instead of stopping Abu Bakr (This part of Sharia is known as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hazriah-Hasan/publication/336374711_PROPHETIC_SUNNAH/links/5d9ef1e0a6fdcc04fac678ad/PROPHETIC-SUNNAH.pdf">Taqriri Hadith</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/54/19">Sahih al-Bukhari 2731, 2732</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>… Then ‘Urwa said, “O Muhammad! Won’t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of any one amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.”  Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him by saying<strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">‘Go suck clitoris of al-Lat (the female Goddess)’</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>and said, "Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet  alone?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">But the Muslim English translator of Sahih Bukhari didn't translate the exact words of Abu Bakr, Instead of that, he distorted the translation and wrote (<a href="https://theislamissue.wordpress.com/2020/02/09/bukhari-translators-embarrassed-by-abu-bakrs-potty-mouth/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">" Hearing that, Abu Bakr <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>abused</strong></span> him and said, "Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet (ﷺ) alone?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western">So, the Muslim translator deleted the original words"Go suck clitoris of al-Lat (the female Goddess)", and used the word "abused" instead. </p>
<p class="western">This distortion is pure dishonesty from the Muslims. They are hiding this part of Sharia of Islam, which not only allows abusing the non-Muslims, but their gods too, and that too in the worst form. </p>
<p class="western">There was no insult or abuse present in the words of 'Urwah (i.e. the ambassador of Quraysh), and he was only telling his opinion as Muslims had already run away in the battle of Uhud, leaving Muhammad alone.  </p>
<p class="western">As we made clear above according to the Islamic standards, Muhammad didn't stop Abu Bakr from these abusive words, which automatically makes it a part of Islamic Sharia. Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqallani thus made it clear (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201122233718/https://theislamissue.wordpress.com/2020/02/09/bukhari-translators-embarrassed-by-abu-bakrs-potty-mouth/">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western">The clitoris is the piece of flesh that remains in the woman’s vulva after circumcision. Al-Laat is the name of one of the idols that Quraysh and Thaqeef used to worship. It was the custom of the Arabs to revile one another in this manner, but by mentioning the mother, so Abu Bakr wanted to go further in reviling ‘Urwah by referring to his object of worship instead of his mother. What made him do that was his anger towards him when he accused the Muslims of being cowards and saying that they would flee. This also indicates that it is permissible to say words that are regarded as foul or bad for the purpose of rebuking one who behaves in a manner that leads to him deserving that. Ibn al-Munayir said: In the words of Abu Bakr we see an insult to the enemy, rejection of their beliefs, and highlighting the flaws in their belief when they said that al-Laat was the daughter of Allah – exalted be Allah far above that – by suggesting that if she was a daughter that she would have what every female has<br>Fath al-Bari 5/340</p>

<p class="western">Please read more details <a href="../blasphemy/135-abu-bakr-s-blasphemy-telling-quraysh-to-go-and-suck-the-clitoris-of-their-female-goddess-al-lat.html">here. </a></p>
<h3 class="western">Blasphemy Laws: The reason why the translation of this Hadith was distorted</h3>
<p class="western">On one side, extremist Muslims introduced draconian Blasphemy Laws in Muslim countries (and now want the same blasphemy laws to be introduced in the Western Secular countries too), but on the other hand, the Quran and Hadith are themselves full of insult and blasphemy of the Non-Muslims. Please read our detailed article about <a href="../women-general/5-love-vs-hijab.html">Blasphemy Laws and the Insult of the Opponents by Quran and Muhammad</a>.</p>
<p class="western">Thus, these extremist Muslims had to hide this Hadith from the eyes of non-Muslims (whose majority don't know Arabic), while it is impossible to argue for the blasphemy laws against Islam/Muhammad in the presence of this Hadith. Therefore, the extremist Muslims thought to achieve their goal by deceiving the people through the distorted translation. </p>

<h2>Linguistic Mistake in the Quran, Indicating Its Human Origins</h2>
<p>Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/11/default.htm">4:11</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Allah is incorrectly using the phrase “<strong>more than two daughters</strong>” when He actually wanted to say “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”.</p>
<p>Please read the detailed article <a href="../divine-revelation-or-a-human-drama/166-quran-s-mathematical-mistakes-in-the-inheritance-laws.html">here.</a></p>
<p>It is a clear linguistic mistake, and it happened while no Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own, and he was not safe from making human mistakes like these. </p>
<p>All Muslim Scholars agree that two daughters will get 2/3 of the estate.</p>
<p>Muhammad himself distributed 2/3rd of the estate between two daughters. </p>
<p>Sunan Tirmidhi, 2092:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The wife of Sa’d bin Rabi’ came with the two daughters of Sa’d to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, these are the two daughters of Sa’d. He was killed with you on the day of Uhud, and their paternal uncle has taken all that their father left behind, and a woman is only married for her wealth.’ The Prophet (ﷺ) remained silent until the Verse of inheritance was revealed to him. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called the brother of Sa’d bin Rabi’ and said: ‘Give the two daughters of Sa’d two thirds of his wealth, and give his wife on eighth, and take what is left.’”</p>

<h3>Tehrif (Distortion) Case:</h3>
<p>It was such a big error, that modern Muslim Quran Translators have to make a TEHRIF (Distortion) in its translation, and change it to “<strong>two or more daughters</strong>”. For example, look at the translation of Yousuf Ali. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Quran 4:11</a>) Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, <span style="color: #236fa1; background-color: #eccafa;"><strong>two or more</strong></span>, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. (<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/st30.htm">Yusuf Ali, Saudi Revised Edition,1985</a>)</p>

<h2>May Allah KILL the Jews</h2>

</blockquote>
<p>English Translation by Mohsin Khan:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), in the year of the Conquest of Mecca, saying, "Allah and His Apostle made illegal the trade of alcohol, dead animals, pigs and idols." The people asked, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What about the fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the hides; and people use it for lights?" He said, "No, it is illegal." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) further said, <strong>"May Allah <span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ff0000;">curse</span> the Jews</strong>, for Allah made the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the fat and sold it and ate its price."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p>Muhammad used the word Qatal (<strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ff0000;">قَاتَلَ</span></strong>), which if translated correctly means “<strong>kill</strong>”  (i.e. May Allah <strong>KILL</strong> the Jews), nevertheless, Muslim Translation distorted the exact words of Muhammad, and used instead "<strong>curse</strong>".</p>
<p>These words of "May Allah kill the Jews) is also found 4 more times in Sahih Bukhari, and the Muslim Translator distorted the translation at all these places ( <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:437">437</a>, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2223">2223</a>, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2224">2224</a>, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2236">2236 </a>and <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4633">4633</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Question: Why was the Muslim Translator forced to distort the translation here?</strong></p>
<p><strong> Answer: </strong> </p>
<p>During the Meccan period, Muslims were weak and they feared the wrath of the people of Mecca. </p>
<p>When the opponents mocked Muhammad and even physically tortured him too for his claim of prophethood, the question was raised why didn't the Mighty Allah helps his prophet, and defend him against the Kuffar? </p>
<p>Muhammad had no answer to this question. Thus he made an excuse that the verse of Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/21.107">21:107</a> had been revealed by Allah, where he (i.e. Muhammad) was mentioned as رحمة للعالمين  (i.e. Mercy for whole mankind and the universe), and thus he cannot pray for the destruction of his opponents.</p>
<p>There are many Ahadith too, where the same situation happened. For example, when Muhammad went to Ta'if, his opponents mocked and tortured him. Thereupon, Muhammad claimed that Allah sent the angel Jibrael to kill all the people of Ta'if, but since Muhammad is a MERCY for mankind, he asked Jibrael not to destroy them. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/59/42">Sahih Bukhari, 3231</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Muhammad said, while returning back from Ta'if after they rejected his claim of prophethood) ... So I departed, overwhelmed with excessive sorrow, and proceeded on, and could not relax till I found myself at Qarnath-Tha-alib where I lifted my head towards the sky to see a cloud shading me unexpectedly. I looked up <strong>and saw Gabriel in it</strong>. He called me saying, 'Allah has heard your people's saying to you, and what they have replied back to you,<strong> Allah has sent the Angel of the Mountains to you so that you may order him to do whatever you wish to these people</strong>.' The Angel of the Mountains called and greeted me, and then said, "O Muhammad! Order what you wish. If you like, <strong>I will let Al-Akh-Shabain (i.e. two mountains) fall on them</strong>." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "<strong>No (don't destroy them)</strong> but I hope that Allah will let them beget children who will worship Allah Alone, and will worship None besides Him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, today all the Muslims are brainwashed to believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prophet Muhammad was a MERCY for the whole of mankind,</li>
<li>And prophet Muhammad never prayed anything bad even for his worst enemies, but always prayed to Allah to have mercy upon them. </li>
</ul>
<p>But indeed all that was Muhammad's own drama of revelation, and thus it had human mistakes and contradictions, and Muhammad was himself wishing for the "destruction/killing" of Jews (later in Madina) in the above-mentioned hadith. That is why Muslims distorted the English translation of this hadith. </p>

<h2>Destroying anything similar to the Christian Cross (Non-Muslim phobia of Muhammad)</h2>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5952">Sahih Bukhari, 5952</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>حَدَّثَنَا مُعَاذُ بْنُ فَضَالَةَ، حَدَّثَنَا هِشَامٌ، عَنْ يَحْيَى، عَنْ عِمْرَانَ بْنِ حِطَّانَ، أَنَّ عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ حَدَّثَتْهُ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم لَمْ يَكُنْ يَتْرُكُ فِي بَيْتِهِ شَيْئًا فِيهِ تَصَالِيبُ إِلاَّ نَقَضَهُ‏.‏</p>
</blockquote>
<p>English Translation by Mohsin Khan:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha:<strong> I</strong> never used to leave in the Prophet (ﷺ) house anything carrying images or crosses but he obliterated it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p>Correct Translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: Prophet never used to leave in his house anything which was similar to crosses (like the ones who Christians have) but he obliterated it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>The question is, who brought those crosses into his house? Was it Mariyah (his concubine), or someone else? </p>
<p>Moreover, Muhammad was suffering from a non-Muslim phobia, and he opposed each and everything which could have resembled the non-Muslims. For example, he said to Muslims <a href="https://dorar.net/h/eea2c998df42faaa64eed0096e0a361a">وقرّوا عنانينكُم ، وقصّروا سبالكُم ، وخالفوا أهلَ الكتابِ</a>  (Translation: Grow your beards long and cut your moustache and oppose the people of book i.e. Jews and Christians and Zoroastrians).  </p>

<h2>Proving through distorted translation that 'Aisha was 16 years old when Muhammad married her</h2>
<p>Here is the distorted Hadith:</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">(the wife of the Prophet) I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>age of puberty</strong></span>. Not a day passed but the Prophet (ﷺ) visited us, both in the mornings and evenings.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The hadith has Aisha addressing when his parents became Muslim.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is the line. قَالَتْ لَمْ أَعْقِلْ أَبَوَىَّ إِلاَّ وَهُمَا يَدِينَانِ الدِّينَ</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And according to the English translation, it's "My parents have been Muslim since I attained the <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">age of puberty</span>.</strong>"</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But an honest translation will be: "For as far as<span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong> I knew (i.e. I can remember)</strong></span>, my parents were always Muslims."</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The word أَعْقِلْ means thoughts or reasoning, but the translator, Muhsin Khan, has used the word 'puberty'. The meaning rather is simply that 'Aisha was aware that her parents were following Islam. A literal translation would be "I was not aware of my parents other than that the two of them both acknowledged the religion". The exact same Arabic phrase is translated correctly by the same translator in another narration of the same hadith (<a href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-3/Book-37/Hadith-494/">link</a>).</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The question is: "Why did Islamic apologists distort the translation?"</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The answer is that they want to prove when Abu Bakr accepted Islam, 'Aisha had already gained puberty. This would then mean that 'Aisha was not a minor girl of 6 years when Muhammad married her, but she was already a grown-up adult girl at the time of marriage. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>

She halted me at the door, <span style="color: #1200ff;"><strong>and I burst into laughter (Arabic: هِيهْ هِيهْ)</strong></span>. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Abu Dawud said: That is to say: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I </strong><strong>menstruated (Arabic:أَىْ تَنَفَّسَتْ)</strong></span>, and I was brought in a house, and there were some women of the Ansari in it.</span></p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Arabic words <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #1200ff;">هِيهْ هِيهْ</span></strong></span> don't mean "bursting into laughter", but according to Imam Abu Dawud they mean "I breathed".</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the Arabic words <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>أَىْ تَنَفَّسَتْ</strong></span> don't mean "I menstruated", but they mean "I breathed". </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://archive.org/details/AllInOne-Hadiths-EngArabicDarusalam_201407/All in One-Sunan Abu Dawud-Eng/page/n2738/mode/1up?q=4933">Darussalam English Translation of Sunan Abu Dawud</a> too translates this sentence as <em><strong>“ She made me stand at the door and I started to breathe deeply.” </strong></em>and there is absolutely no mention of "menstruation" or laughing in it. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The <a href="https://mohaddis.com/View/Abu-Daud/T2/4933">Urdu Translator</a> of Sunan Abu Dawud also translated it as "I breathed (i.e. taking a long cold breath)".</p>
<p>A similar hadith is present in <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3894">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3894</a>, which also makes it clear that it was about "Breathing". </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Please remember, it is always a huge <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>psychological burden</strong></span> for every 9 years old girl if she is told that she has been wed, and she has to leave the house of her parents, and go to the house of another total stranger person (who is above 50 years old), and live and to indulge in sexual activities with him. <strong>Every SINGLE</strong> 9-year-old girl will by nature automatically protest against it.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just look at this video of a 9-year-old Afghan girl who is crying bitterly and protesting and doesn't want to leave with her husband (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/telgq4/prophet_muhammad_married_a_6_yo_aisha_when_he_was/">Video Link</a>).</p>

  <source src="../../../images/Afghan_Girl.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Alone, telling a 9-year-old girl what sex is, brings a huge psychological pressure on her. But Islam not only gives this shock to little girls about sex, but also compels them to leave the house of their parents and siblings and friends, go with a stranger in his house, and engage in sexual activities with him, even if he is a 50-year-old man. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> </p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Watching football matches being Haram for women</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islamists discourage/forbid women from watching football matches and especially going to stadiums to watch them (<a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/146844/is-it-permissible-to-watch-football-soccer-games-on-television">Fatwa</a>). </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But the problem for them was, 'Aisha herself watched Ethiopians playing in the courtyard of the mosque.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Sahih Bukhari, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230508100912/https://bewley.virtualave.net/bukhari35.html">4894</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">4894. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Abyssinians were playing with their spears and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, acted as a screen for me while I was looking. I continued to look until I was the one to leave. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">So estimate how long a young girl is eager for amusement</span>.</strong>" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230508100912/https://bewley.virtualave.net/bukhari35.html">Translated by 'Aisha Bewley</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But Islamists had to forbid it for women. So, they did a Tehrif (Distortion) in the translation and showed only young girls (who have not reached puberty) are allowed to watch men playing games. Thus, Mohsin Khan (A Salafi Translator of Sahih Bukhari) made the following Tehrif in the translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Sahih Bukhari, <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5236">5236</a>:</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">حَدَّثَنَا إِسْحَاقُ بْنُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ الْحَنْظَلِيُّ، عَنْ عِيسَى، عَنِ الأَوْزَاعِيِّ، عَنِ الزُّهْرِيِّ، عَنْ عُرْوَةَ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ قَالَتْ رَأَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَسْتُرُنِي بِرِدَائِهِ، وَأَنَا أَنْظُرُ إِلَى الْحَبَشَةِ يَلْعَبُونَ فِي الْمَسْجِدِ، حَتَّى أَكُونَ أَنَا الَّذِي أَسْأَمُ، فَاقْدُرُوا قَدْرَ الْجَارِيَةِ الْحَدِيثَةِ السِّنِّ الْحَرِيصَةِ عَلَى اللَّهْوِ‏.‏</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: <span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Prophet (ﷺ) was screening me with his Rida' (garment covering the upper part of the body) while I was looking at the Ethiopians who were playing in the courtyard of the mosque. (I continued watching) till I was satisfied. So you may deduce from this event <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">how a little girl (who has not reached the age of puberty)</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">who is eager to enjoy amusement <span style="color: #ff0000;">should be treated in this respect</span></span></strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The translation of 'Aisha Bewley is correct, and there is no mention of reaching puberty or not in the original Arabic Text. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span>Revelation caused SHIVERING, or revelation caused SNORING?</h2>
<p>Instilling FEAR and DREAD in the hearts of their followers is the most effective weapon used by those who claim to be in contact with gods, deities, and the spiritual world. Muhammad used the same tactics at many places, including how revelation comes to him. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2">Sahih Bukhari, 2</a>:</strong></p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated 'Aisha:  Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah's Messenger "O Allah's Messenger! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?" Allah's Messenger replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says." 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the Prophet being inspired divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead.<strong><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:2114"></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong><a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4738">Sunan Abu Dawood, 4738</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">‘Abd Allah (b. Mas’ud) reported the Messenger of Allah as saying: "When Allah, the exalted, speaks to send revelation, the inhabitants of heaven hear the clanging of a bell from the heavens like a chain being dragged across a rock, and they swoon (faint). They continue to remain like that until Jibril comes to them. When he comes to them, they recover and say: 'O Jibril, what did your Lord say?' He would say: 'The truth,' and they would say: 'The truth, the truth.'"</div>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a Direct Witness caught Muhammad to be SLEEPING and SNORING during the revelation:</p>
<p><span><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1789">Sahih al-Bukhari, The Book of Umra (Translated by Aisha Bewley)</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>حَدَّثَنِي صَفْوَانُ بْنُ يَعْلَى بْنِ أُمَيَّةَ يَعْنِي، عَنْ أَبِيهِ، أَنَّ رَجُلاً، أَتَى النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَهُوَ بِالْجِعْرَانَةِ وَعَلَيْهِ جُبَّةٌ وَعَلَيْهِ أَثَرُ الْخَلُوقِ أَوْ قَالَ صُفْرَةٍ فَقَالَ كَيْفَ تَأْمُرُنِي أَنْ أَصْنَعَ فِي عُمْرَتِي فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم، فَسُتِرَ بِثَوْبٍ وَوَدِدْتُ أَنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَقَدْ أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْهِ <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>الْوَحْىُ‏</strong></span>.‏ فَقَالَ عُمَرُ تَعَالَ أَيَسُرُّكَ أَنْ تَنْظُرَ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم وَقَدْ أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>الْوَحْىَ </strong></span>قُلْتُ نَعَمْ‏.‏ فَرَفَعَ طَرَفَ الثَّوْبِ، فَنَظَرْتُ إِلَيْهِ لَهُ غَطِيطٌ وَأَحْسِبُهُ قَالَ كَغَطِيطِ الْبَكْرِ‏.‏ فَلَمَّا سُرِّيَ عَنْهُ قَالَ ‏ "‏ أَيْنَ السَّائِلُ عَنِ الْعُمْرَةِ اخْلَعْ عَنْكَ الْجُبَّةَ وَاغْسِلْ أَثَرَ الْخَلُوقِ عَنْكَ، وَأَنْقِ الصُّفْرَةَ، وَاصْنَعْ فِي عُمْرَتِكَ كَمَا تَصْنَعُ فِي حَجِّكِ ‏"‏‏.‏</span></p>
<p><span>1697. Safwan ibn Ya'la ibn Umayya related from his father, "While the Prophet, may Allah bless him and <i>grant</i> him peace, was at al-Ji'rana with some of his Companions, a man came to him wearing a cloak which had traces of khaluq-perfume (or he said, 'yellowness') on it and said, 'What do you order me to do in my <i>'umra</i>?' Revelation came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he was shaded by a cloth. I had been wanting to see the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when the <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">revelation</span></strong> was descending on him. 'Umar said, 'Come on, would you like to see the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when Allah is sending down the <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);"><strong>revelation</strong></span> on him?' I said, 'Yes.' So he lifted a corner of the cloth and I looked at him and <strong>he was <span style="color: rgb(255, 22, 0);">snoring</span>. (I think he said, 'Snoring like a young camel.')</strong> . When the state left him, he said, 'Where is the man who asked about<i> 'umra</i>? Take off your cloak, wash off the trace of <i>khaluq</i> from yourself and then wash away the yellowness. Do the same in your<i> 'umra</i> as you do in your hajj.'"</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tehrif (Distortion) Case:</strong></span></p>
<p>However, Islamic apologists have distorted the translation of this hadith by using the word "<strong>inspiration</strong>" instead of "<strong>revelation</strong>." For example, see the translation of this<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1789"> Hadith at Sunnah.com</a>. The Arabic word used here is "الْوَحْىُ," which means "revelation," not "inspiration."</p>
<p>They resort to these deceptive tactics to conceal this Islamic contradiction (of Shivering vs. Snoring) from innocent people.</p>     </div>

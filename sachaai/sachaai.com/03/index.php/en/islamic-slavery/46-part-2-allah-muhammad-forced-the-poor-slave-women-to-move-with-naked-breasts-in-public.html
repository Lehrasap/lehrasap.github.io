<li><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">According to Islam, the Hijab was considered a privilege and honor exclusively for free Muslim women, while slave women were not allowed to take it.<br></span></li>

<li>Additionally, it is worth noting that Muhammad specified that the 'Awrah (nakedness) of slave women should be from navel to knee, while their chests remained uncovered. This meant that there were thousands of slave women who appeared publicly, even in the presence of Muhammad, with their breasts exposed.</li>

<p>In pre-Islamic Arabia, there existed a cultural practice where high-status women were required to wear veils as a symbol of "honor," while prostitutes and slave women were not allowed to veil themselves.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Muhammad did not introduce Islamic hijab with the intention of promoting modesty, but rather he adopted the prevailing practices of the pre-Islamic Arabs. His aim was to distinguish free Muslim women from slave women through the implementation of hijab.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId434974"></a>In the pre-Islamic era, neither free nor slave women used to cover their breasts</h2>
<p>During the pre-Islamic era, it was customary for women, both free and slave, in various cultures around the world, including pre-Islamic Arab society, to not cover their chests.</p>

Asma expressed her disapproval of this, and as a result, Allah revealed the verse: "...And let them draw their coverings over their chests" [Quran 24:31], meaning they should cast their outer garments in a way that it covers their chests, concealing what is beneath them. This was in contrast to the practices of the women of the pre-Islamic era (jahiliyyah), as they did not observe such covering. Instead, women would pass by men <strong>with their chests exposed, revealing their necks, hair, and earrings</strong>.</div>

<p>What Muhammad did was to ask free Muslim women to wear Hijab, but he PROHIBITED slave women to take Hijab. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, even after the verse of the Hijab, there were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. And it stayed the same way during the 1300 years long history of Islamic Slavery. </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId580552"></a>The Quranic Verse makes clear that Hijab was only for free Muslim women against slave women</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=33&amp;vid=59">Quran 33:59</a>:<br>يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَٰجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَآءِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَٰبِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰٓ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا<br>O Prophet! say to your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they let down upon them their over-garments (Arabic: Jilbab); this will be more proper, so that they may be<strong> recognized (as free Women)</strong> and<strong> not annoyed/molested</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the consensus of Muslim Quran commentators, it is widely documented that this particular verse was revealed in response to a specific incident in Medina. During that time, people would gather and sit on the sides of the streets, subjecting passing women to harassment and molestation. However, upon the revelation of this verse, the harassment of free women ceased as they started wearing hijab, which distinguished them from slave girls who did not wear hijab. Unfortunately, the molestation of slave girls persisted, as their lack of hijab served as a recognizable marker of their status as slaves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>يقول تعالى آمراً رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم تسليماً أن يأمر النساء المؤمنات ــــ خاصة أزواجه وبناته لشرفهن ــــ بأن يدنين عليهن من جلابيبهن ليتميزن عن سمات نساء الجاهلية وسمات الإماء ... قال السدي في قوله تعالى { يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ قُل لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَآءِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلاَبِيبِهِنَّ ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلاَ يُؤْذَيْنَ } قال كان ناس من فساق أهل المدينة يخرجون بالليل حين يختلظ الظلام إلى طرق المدينة يتعرضون للنساء، وكانت مساكن أهل المدينة ضيقة، فإذا كان الليل، خرج النساء إلى الطرق يقضين حاجتهن، فكان أولئك الفساق يبتغون ذلك منهن، فإذا رأوا المرأة عليها جلباب، قالوا هذه حرة، فكفوا عنها، وإذا رأوا المرأة ليس عليها جلباب، قالوا هذه أمة، فوثبوا عليها، وقال مجاهد يتجلببن فيعلم أنهن حرائر، فلا يتعرض لهن فاسق بأذى ولا ريبة.</p>
<p>Translation:<br>... (In this verse, Allah ordered the free women) to draw their Jilbabs over their bodies,<strong> so that they will be distinct in their appearance</strong> from the women of the Jahiliyyah and from <strong>slave women ... <br></strong>And As-<strong>Suddi</strong> said about the revelation of this verse 33:59 that the mischief-mongers among the people of Madīnah would come out on the streets at dusk and get after the women. The houses of the people of Madīnah [in those days] were very small in size and at nightfall the women would go out on these streets [making their way to the fields] to relieve themselves. These evil people would tease and molest these women. While if they saw a woman who would be wearing a Jilbab (cloak/outer garment), they would say she is a free woman [and not a slave] and would abstain [from molesting her] and if they saw a woman who would not be wearing a cloak, they would molest her by saying that she is a slave woman.<br>And Mujahid said that those women would wear cloaks [in the way prescribed by the Qur'ān] so that it be known that they are free women and the mischief-mongers would not then harm or molest them.</p>

This was because free women would also go out, and they would be mistaken for slave women, and people would approach them and cause harm. The Prophet (peace be upon him) then commanded the believing women to bring their outer garments closer to them (i.e. to take the Hijab).

<blockquote>
<p>هذا أمر من الله تعالى للنساء المؤمنات، وغيرة منه لأزواجهن عباده المؤمنين، وتمييز لهن عن صفة نساء الجاهلية وفعال المشركات. وكان سبب نزول هذه الآية ما ذكره مقاتل بن حيان قال بلغنا ــــ والله أعلم ــــ أن جابر بن عبد الله الأنصاري حدث أن أسماء بنت مرشدة كانت في محل لها في بني حارثة، فجعل النساء يدخلن عليها غير متأزرات، فيبدو ما في أرجلهن من الخلاخل، وتبدو صدورهن وذوائبهن، فقالت أسماء ما أقبح هذا فأنزل الله تعالى { وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَـٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَـٰرِهِنَّ }</p>
<p class="justify1">This is a command (i.e. veiling) from Allah Almighty to the believing women, as a protection for their honor and a distinction from the characteristics of women in the pre-Islamic era and the practices of pagan women. The reason behind the revelation of this verse, as mentioned by Muqatil ibn Hayyan, is that Jabir ibn Abdullah al-Ansari reported that Asma bint Marwan had a designated place in Bani Haritha, where women would visit her without wearing veils. <strong>Thus, their ankles would be exposed, along with their chests and ornaments</strong>. Upon seeing this, Asma expressed her disapproval. As a result, Allah Almighty revealed the verse: "And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision [i.e., to look down and not to expose their adornment]..." (Quran 24:31).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>Islamic preachers often assert that those individuals who engaged in harassment and molestation of women while sitting on the sides of the streets were hypocrites. However, this claim is contested by some who argue that they were not hypocrites but rather companions of Muhammad (Sahaba).</p>
<p>These individuals, who engaged in harassment and molestation, were not addressed as hypocrites in the Quran. Surprisingly, the Quran neither issued warnings nor threats against them, let alone punishments. Instead, the Quran seemingly allowed them to continue their misconduct towards slave women, while providing protection only to free women through the requirement of hijab.</p>
<p>This portrayal of events raises concerns, as it appears that the Quran provided no safeguards for the well-being of slave women, inadvertently granting these individuals a "license" to persist in their mistreatment of vulnerable slave girls.</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId89821"></a>Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but it is this respect and acknowledgement of women's autonomy that truly embodies the concept of modesty</h2>
<p>Regrettably, a significant majority of ordinary Muslims today remain unaware of the historical realities and complexities surrounding hijab and its relation to Islam. This truth often comes as a surprise to them, as many Islamic preachers strive to conceal or downplay these aspects.</p>
<p>It is common for some Muslims to assert that women must wear hijab in order to prevent men from experiencing lustful desires, using the analogy that an uncovered candy attracts flies. However, it is important to recognize that this viewpoint oversimplifies the multifaceted reasons and interpretations associated with hijab within the Islamic tradition.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Please see, it was Islam which compelled thousands of slave women to move in public without a Hijab (i.e. without a wrapper). So, the question is, did Islam thus make Sahaba sexually aroused and did Sahaba rape those slave women for having naked breasts in public?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong>Reality: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em>Hijab has nothing to do with modesty, but modesty is truly defined by the respect for women and their autonomy to make choices about their lives.</em></li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Western world, with its emphasis on upholding women's rights and their choices, is a true example of modesty and decency.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em>Hijab is not modesty, but for 14 prolonged centuries, it has been a distressing symbol of severe discrimination against impoverished slave women.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId63911"></a>Role of Umar Ibn Khattab</h2>
<p>It is known that Muhammad faced challenges when it came to rejecting Umar's desires and suggestions. Throughout Muhammad's life, there were instances where Umar made wishes or suggestions, and Muhammad later claimed to receive revelations in alignment with those desires.</p>
<p>This pattern is observed in the context of veiling women as well. It appears that Umar Ibn Khattab played a significant role in advocating for the veiling of free Muslim women, as he engaged in multiple discussions with Muhammad on the matter (<a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:146">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 146</a>). </p>
<p>Subsequently, following the unfortunate incident of women being molested in Medina, Muhammad claimed that the verses regarding veiling were revealed in accordance with Umar's desires.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that Umar held more extreme views on this matter. It appears that he was not content with the ruling of veiling for women and sought something beyond that. This becomes apparent through an incident involving Umar and Sawda, one of Muhammad's wives, which took place after the revelation of the hijab verses</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4795</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature <strong>after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil</strong>. She had a large frame and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, "O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us,<strong> so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out.</strong> Sauda returned while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I went out to answer the call of nature and `Umar said to me so-and-so." Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), "You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To those who advocate for Umar's stance, one might question the following:</p>
<p>Why should Sawda, or any woman for that matter, bear the burden of constantly finding new ways to conceal herself and endure the added restrictions? What harm would it have caused if people still recognized her when she ventured outside?</p>
<p>Interestingly, while Umar expressed dissatisfaction with Hafsa's veiling, he paradoxically resorted to physically disciplining slave women for attempting to wear hijab by beating them with a stick. Furthermore, he even stripped them of their jilbab (outer garment sheet), as we will explore further in this article. </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId130774"></a>An excuse by Islamic preachers: But the verse of Hijab 33:59 was revealed during the incident of 'Umar and Sawda</h3>
<p>It is impossible for Islam apologists to accept the incident that Sahaba used to molest women and thus Hijab verse was revealed only to differentiate between the Free and the Slave women. They have to deny it while it is shaking the whole religion of  Islam and every person becomes doubtful about it after knowing these facts.</p>
<p>Therefore, they try to use the following tradition and claim that the verse of the Hijab was not revealed due to the molestation of slave women by companions, but during the incident of Umar and Sawda.</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:146">Sahih Bukhari, 146</a>:</p>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّ أَزْوَاجَ النَّبِيِّ، صلى الله عليه وسلم كُنَّ يَخْرُجْنَ بِاللَّيْلِ إِذَا تَبَرَّزْنَ إِلَى الْمَنَاصِعِ ـ وَهُوَ صَعِيدٌ أَفْيَحُ ـ فَكَانَ عُمَرُ يَقُولُ لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم احْجُبْ نِسَاءَكَ‏.‏ فَلَمْ يَكُنْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَفْعَلُ، فَخَرَجَتْ سَوْدَةُ بِنْتُ زَمْعَةَ زَوْجُ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم لَيْلَةً مِنَ اللَّيَالِي عِشَاءً، وَكَانَتِ امْرَأَةً طَوِيلَةً، فَنَادَاهَا عُمَرُ أَلاَ قَدْ عَرَفْنَاكِ يَا سَوْدَةُ‏.‏ حِرْصًا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْزِلَ الْحِجَابُ، فَأَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ آيَةَ الْحِجَابِ‏.‏</p>
<p>Narrated `Aisha: The wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqi` at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. `Umar used to say to the Prophet (ﷺ) "Let your wives be veiled," but Allah's Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam`a the wife of the Prophet (ﷺ) went out at `Isha' time and <strong>she was a tall lady</strong>. `Umar addressed her and said, "I have recognized (Arabic: عَرَفْنَاكِ) you, O Sauda." He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed.<strong> </strong>So Allah revealed the verses of "Al-Hijab".</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Our Response: </strong></p>
<p>Firstly, it is clear that any sub-narrator of this tradition made a mistake, while another tradition of <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795">Sahih Bukhari</a> (which we have already mentioned above), is also from 'Aisha, where she clearly mentioned that this incident of 'Umar and Sawda happened <strong>after</strong> the verse of Hijab had already been revealed. </p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4795">Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4795</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature <strong>after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil</strong>. <strong>She had a large frame and everybody who knew her before could recognize her</strong>. So `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, "O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. ....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, it is also clear from both the traditions that Umar needed to recognize her through her <strong>tall height/large frame</strong>, while she was indeed wearing a Hijab (Jilbab), due to which he was unable to see her face. This proves that the verse of Hijab (33:59) had already been revealed before this incident. </p>
<p>Thirdly,  the verse itself (33:59) contradicts the notion that it was specifically revealed during the incident involving Umar and Sawda. There are two significant facts that support this claim.</p>
<p>The first fact is, by taking Jilbab (cloaks), actually the women <strong>Cannot be recognized </strong>(while their faces are covered). Therefore, nobody knows which woman is actually inside the cloak. </p>
<p>But the Quran is saying: "(the women) should take Jilbab (cloaks) so that they <strong>Can be recognised </strong>(Arabic: أدنى أن يعرفن) ...".</p>
<p>So, why then the Quran is saying the <strong>opposite</strong>, i.e. that they <strong>Can</strong> be recognized by using cloaks? The reason is, the Quran is saying it in the sense of recognizing who are slave women, and who are free Muslim women. </p>
<p>Thus, this part of the verse is itself proof that this verse was not revealed about the incident of Umar/Sawda.</p>
<p>And the second fact is, this verse is also claiming: "... and (these women are)<strong> not molested</strong>".</p>
<p>Please ask these Islamic preachers, if Umar Ibn Khattab was molesting Sawda. Surely the answer is No. It was not Umar Ibn Khattab who molested Sawda, but it were those people, who were sitting on the streets, who were molesting the women of Medina. </p>
<p>Therefore, this serves as further evidence that the hijab verse (33:59) is unrelated to the incident involving Umar and Sawda. Instead, it stands as a testimony to the existence of the twelve traditions that recount the incident of women being molested in Medina.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId616740"></a>Umar Ibn Khattab, the second Caliph, used to beat the slave women with a stick if they ever attempted to take<b> Hijab (Jilbab)</b></h2>
<p class="western">According to authentic traditions, Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat those slave girls with a stick, who ever attempted to hide their naked bodies by taking Jilbab. He used to tell those slave girls not to try to become equal in status with the free Muslim women by taking Jilbab/Muqna (Jilbab and Muqna, both are outer garments, used for Hijab) .</p>

<p>Anas bin Malik said: "I entered upon Umar bin Al-Khattab with a female slave that he knew, either from the Muhajireen or the Ansar, and she was wearing a well-adorned cloak (i.e. Jilbab, which was used to cover her breasts and body with it). He asked her, 'Have you been set free?' She replied, 'No.' He then said, 'What is with the cloak?' 'Take it off your head. The cloak is only for the free women among the believers.' She hesitated, so he got up and took it off her head forcefully, hitting her with a whip until he removed it from her head."</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="western">Narrated to us Hushaym, from Khalid, from Abu Qilaba, who said: "Umar ibn al-Khattab, during his caliphate, did not leave any slave girl who could cover herself. He said: 'Covering oneself is only for free (Muslim/Believing) women, so they may not be harmed (i.e. people can differentiate them with slave women and don't harm the free Muslim women).'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The traditions related to Umar Ibn Khattab further corroborate the twelve traditions that highlight the revelation of the hijab verse (33:59) as a means to distinguish between slave women and free Muslim women. These traditions collectively provide supporting evidence for this understanding of the verse's purpose.</span></p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId741600"></a>Please also note the difference between "Jilbab" and "Khimar":</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="western"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilbāb">A Jilbab</a> (or  <a href="https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/مقنعة/">Muqna</a>) was a big outer garment/sheet that is put on the head, draped around the body and that totally covers the breasts and the body of the woman. In the verse of Hijab (Quran 33:59), the writer of the Quran ordered free Muslim women to use this same Jilbab, to cover their breasts and bodies. While slave women were not allowed to use Jilbab to cover their breasts and the body. In traditions, Umar Ibn Khattab removed this same Jilbab from the heads of slave women, which again exposed their naked breasts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western">And “Khimar (Arabic:  خمار)” is a small headscarf, which covers only the head and comes up to the shoulders. We see Arab men using this “Khimar” (Arabic headscarf) today. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:275">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ <strong>وَالْخِمَارِ</strong></p>
<p> Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped over the socks and <strong>Khimar</strong> (Arabic Head Scarf)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Slave women were allowed to cover their head and hair by wearing <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21134/is-niqab-compulsory#:%7E:text=Khimar%20comes%20from%20the%20word,something%20else%20is%20called%20Khimar.">Khimaar خمأر</a>. Covering the head was a per-Islamic tradition due to the heat in Arab area.</p>
<p>And 'Abdul Razzaq recorded in this book al-Musanif (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115185806/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=73&amp;ID=520&amp;idfrom=4807&amp;idto=4820&amp;bookid=73&amp;startno=6">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>عبد الرزاق عن بن جريج قال بلغني عن أشياخ من أهل المدينة أن الخمر على الإماء إذا حضن وليس عليهن الجلابيب</p>
<p>Abd al-Razzaq narrated from Ibn Jarir who said: "I heard from the elders of Medina that when a slave girt started to menstruate, she would cover her head with Khimar, but not wear a Jilbab."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thus, Khimar was not the main distinguishing factor between free women and slave women, as both of them were covering their heads with Khimar. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The main distinguishing factor between them was Jilbab. And in the traditions above, Umar Ibn Khattab removed this Jilbab of slave women, which again exposed their naked breasts.</p>

<p>The 1400 years of history of Islam also consists of this shameful act against humanity, where Muslims forced those women/girls to become half naked by exposing their breasts, and then forced them to stand in front of thousands of men in the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, who not only looked at them with lust but they were also allowed to touch their private parts (as if they were sheep and goats).</p>

Upon that he replied there is no harm in seeing them while a slave woman has no honour. Rather, it is allowed in order to assess her before bargaining (<a href="http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/الكتب/1893_المصنف-عبد-الرزاق-الصنعاني-ج-٧/الصفحة_287#top">link</a>).</p>
<p>1792 - ( روى أبو حفص بإسناده : " أن ابن عمر كان يضع يده بين ثدييها ( يعني الجارية ) وعلى عجزها من فوق الثياب ويكشف عن ساقها " ذكره في الوقع ) . صحيح . أخرجه البيهقي ( 5 / 329 ) من طريق عبيد الله بن عمر عن نافع عن ابن عمر : " أنه كان إذا اشترى جارية كشف عن ساقها ووضع يده بين ثدييها وعلى عجزها " . وفي آخره زيادة : " وكأنه كان يضعها عليها من وراء الثياب " . ولعلها من البيهقي أو من بعض رواته . والسند صحيح .<br>Abu Hafs narrated with his chain of narration: "Ibn Umar used to place his hand between the breasts of the slave woman (referring to the chest area) and on her private area above her clothing, and he would uncover her leg." It is mentioned it is authentic report. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in his Sunan (5/329) through the narration of Ubaidullah ibn Umar from Nafi' from Ibn Umar: "Whenever he would buy a slave girl, he would uncover her leg and place his hand between her breasts and on her private area." At the end of the narration, there is an addition: "It is as if he would place his hand on her from behind the clothing." It is possible that this addition is from Al-Bayhaqi or from some of its narrators. And the chain of narration is authentic.</p>
<p>Saudi grand Mufti Albani declared this tradition to be "authentic" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619131945/http://islamport.com/w/alb/Web/1202/2090.htm">link</a>).</p>

<p>Abdul Razzaq reported from Ibn Ayyinah, from Amr ibn Dinar, from Mujahid who said: "I was with Ibn Umar in the marketplace when he saw a slave girl being sold. He uncovered her leg and tapped her chest, and he said: 'Buy her, showing them that there is no defect in her.'"

<p class="western">On one side, Muhammad made a woman's life difficult in the name of “Hijab and modesty”,  practically imprisoning her in her home and cutting her off from the outside world. She was prohibited from interacting with other men, and even if she needed to speak, she was required to do so in a harsh voice.</p>

<p class="western">Please remember that this slave girl was there with naked breasts too, which makes things even more complicated.</p>

<p>Can you see these two extreme contradictions?</p>
<p>On one hand, free women are confined and covered from head to toe in Jilbab, and sometimes even further restricted within the walls of their homes. They are forced to live unnatural lives, where any interaction with men is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, slave women are left exposed, with their breasts uncovered. They are treated as commodities, allowing customers to touch their private parts like animals.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This happened while no Allah is present above in the heavens, and a human (i.e. Muhammad) was making the laws in the name of revelations on his own.</p>

<p>As we mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the revelation of the verse of Hijab, neither free Muslim women nor slave women covered their naked breasts in public, as it was a custom of the Arabs of that era.</li>
<li>After the revelation of the verse of Hijab, free Muslim women began covering their naked breasts and bodies with Jilbab <strong>ONLY</strong> in <strong>Public</strong>.</li>
<li>But the instruction to wear Jilbab did not apply indoors in front of Mahram men. Therefore, free Muslim women did not covered their naked breasts with Jilbab inside their homes in front of their Mahram male relatives. According to Islamic law, a free Muslim woman's 'Awrah (private parts) in front of Mahram men extended only from her navel to her knees.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:251">Sahih al Bukhari, Bab Grhusl Volume 1, Book 5, Number 251</a>:</p>

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId666035"></a>Excuses by Islamic apologists:</h2>
<p>Here are a few excuses, which are presented by Islamic apologists today:</p>
<h3>Islamists' Demand: Show us direct Hadith from the Prophet in Bukahri or Muslim that slave women were prophibited to wear the Hijab</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Response:</strong></span></p>
<p>If Muslims insist on finding a direct hadith from Muhammad in Bukhari or Muslim regarding this matter, such a demand is not appropriate because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We could then ask Muslims to present direct hadiths from Bukhari and Muslim where Muhammad explicitly stated the opposite—namely, that it is OBLIGATORY for slave women to wear the Hijab.</li>
<li>The entire 1300-year history of Islamic Slavery, including all Fiqh rulings, historical records, and the unanimous practices of the Ummah, provides ample evidence that slave women were not permitted to wear the Hijab. This raises a crucial question: If this practice was indeed against Islamic Sharia, and Allah already knew that the entire Ummah would be misguided on this issue, why was there <strong>not a single clear verse</strong> revealed in the Quran mandating that slave women must wear the Hijab?</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId464960"></a>The Dishonest Translation of verse 24:31 by modern Islamic apologists to prove that Khimar was also used to cover the naked breasts of slave women</h3>
<p>Please be aware of dishonesty of some of the modern Islamic apologists. Their deception is where they have started claiming that Khimar was not a head covering, but Allah ordered to cover the breasts too with Khimar. </p>
<p>Quran <a href="https://quranx.com/24.31">24:31</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَٰرِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ <strong>بِخُمُرِهِنَّ</strong> عَلَىٰ<strong> جُيُوبِهِنَّ</strong> ۖ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ ءَابَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ ...</p>
<p>[Dr. Mustafa Khattab]  And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their adornments except what normally appears. Let them draw their <strong>veils</strong> (i.e. Khimar خمار)  over their <strong>chests</strong> (Arabic:جُيُوبِهِنَّ), and not reveal their ˹hidden˺ adornments except to their husbands, their fathers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, they have started translating Khimar as "veils" (instead of a "Head Covering"), and the word جُيُوبِ as chests (instead of neckline/bosom). By doing so, they want to make this argument that although Umar took away the Jilbab from slave women, but it didn't expose their naked breasts, while slave women were covering their breasts with Khimar. </p>
<p>However, this modern translation is wrong, and here is proof:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to note that in the verse, the Arabic word جُيُوبِ (singular <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/جيب#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart">جَيْب</a>) is used. When modern Muslim translators translate it as '<strong>chest</strong>', then it is wrong. The correct translation of جَيْب (singular <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/جيب#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart">جَيْب</a>) is '<strong>neckline/bosom</strong>', referring to the area where ornaments like necklaces are worn. It does not refer to covering the breasts of women, but rather the upper part of the chest and neck. You can find the exact translation of this word on wiktionary (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/جيب#:%7E:text=is%20also%20compared.-,Noun,metonymically%29%20breast%2C%20bosom%2C%20heart">link</a>). 'Chest' is not the appropriate translation, as the Arabic word for chest is "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/صدر">Sadar (صدر)</a>". Therefore, this verse only instructed women to conceal their ornaments such as earrings and necklaces by using their headscarves.</li>
<li>However, many Muslim translators (<a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/24/31/default.htm">link</a>) didn't show this dishonesty, and they indeed translated these words (i.e. Khimar and Jiyub) correctly as a "head covering" and "Bosoms/necklines". </li>
</ul>
<p>It is written in Tafsir Madarak al-Tanzil, under verse 24:31 (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;tTafsirNo=17&amp;tSoraNo=24&amp;tAyahNo=31&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=1&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>

<p>كانت جيوبهن واسعة تبدو منها صدورهن وما حواليها وكن يسدلن الخمر من ورائهن فتبقى مكشوفة فأمرن بأن يسدلنها من أقدامهن حتى تغطيها<br>(During the (pre-Islamic) time of ignorance, the custom among the Arab women was) their bosoms were naked due to which their chest and area around it was exposed. And women used to hang their head scarfs (Khimar) on the backside, due to which bosoms (necklines) were exposed. They were ordered (in this verse) to hang their head scarfs on the front side, so that the bosoms are covered. </p>

<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:275">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275</a>:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And it is written in Tafsir-e-Mazhari, under the commentary of this verse 24:31 (<a href="http://equranlibrary.com/tafseer/mazhari/24/31">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the Scholars are 'Unanimous اجماع' that this verse is only for the free (Muslim) women ... Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad deemed the nakedness of a slave woman from navel till knees. While Imam Abu Hanifa considered her stomach and back to be a part of her nakedness too. </p>

<h3><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId747240"></a>Islamic Preachers: Hijab is necessary for a woman so that her husband does not feel jealous and uncomfortable due to his Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة)</h3>
<p>Islamic preachers claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If woman wears revealing clothing which shows her beauty in front of other males; her husband would feel extremely jealous and feel uncomfortable due to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghayrah">Ghayrah (Arabic: غَيْرَة)</a>. But with hijab, this is evaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May we then ask the Islamic preachers what about the Ghayrah of poor slave women? Why did Muhammad prohibit Hijab for slave women? Why did Muhammad then keep the breasts of slave women naked? There were thousands of slave women in front of Muhammad with naked breasts. Why did Umar Ibn Khattab use to beat slave women who took Hijab, even by mistake?</p>
<p>And if a Muslim master got lust for a slave woman of another man, then they could simply swap their slave women with each other, and rape them. Tafsir-e-Mazhari is a commentary of the Quran, which is taught in every Hanafi school. It is written under the commentary of verse 33:52 (<a href="../../../images/swap_slave_girls_mazhari.jpg">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Zayd said about this verse {وَلَآ أَن تَبَدَّلَ بِهِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجٍ nor to exchange your present wives for other women (<a href="https://quranx.com/33.52">Verse 33:52</a>)} that people used to swap their wives during the era of ignorance ... upon that Allah revealed this verse. <strong>But the slave women are not included in it, and you can swap them and there is no problem in it</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, where has that jealousy and Ghayrah gone now? </p>
<p>Even worse, in the case of the wife of the male slave, even this swap is not needed. If the master gets lust for the wife of his male slave, then he can simply take her away from him and rape her. And after fulfilling his lust, he can once again return her over to his slave. </p>
<blockquote><a class="external text" href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5105/" rel="mw:ExtLink" data-ve-attributes="{&quot;rel&quot;:&quot;mw:ExtLink&quot;}">Sahih Bukhari, 5105:</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>وَقَالَ أَنَسٌ: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} ذَوَاتُ الأَزْوَاجِ الْحَرَائِرُ حَرَامٌ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ لاَ يَرَى بَأْسًا أَنْ يَنْزِعَ الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مِنْ عَبْدِهِ.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Anas said: The meaning of the Quranic verse: {وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ} Married free women are forbidden to you except your married slave women that your right hands possess. There is no harm in a man (i.e the owner) taking his female slave (for himself) from his male slave.</blockquote>
<p>So, what is about the Ghairah of a poor male slave, whose wife is being raped by his owner? Unbelievable!</p>
<p>And why does Islam talk only about the Ghairah of men? <strong>Why does it not care even the slightest about the Ghayrah of poor slave women?</strong> Why are they made to be raped by multiple Muslim men in a TEMPORARY sexual relationship without their consent? </p>
<p>Islam turns even small pre-pubescent captive girls of war into slaves, although they had no role in the wars, and they were totally innocent. And then Islam took away all their Ghayrah, and they were also raped by multiple Muslim men in temporary sexual relationships. </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId93010"></a>'Lowering the gazes' is only an Unnatural restriction, which results only in 'sexual frustration':</h3>
<p>Islamic preachers claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Allah ordered the lowering of gazes in the Quran, and it is also modesty. Men normally lustfully gaze at, look at women(even if inadvertently, without being aware of it) but hijab prevents women getting unsolicited, unwanted looks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We absolutely don't agree with Muslim's claim of this so-called 'modesty' in the name of 'lowering the gazes', while:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Lowering of the gazes' is also not modesty, but an unnatural restriction upon the women and the men. </li>
<li>And Muslim men were ordered to lower their gazes only in the presence of free Muslim women. As far as slave women are concerned, then Muslim men are not needed to lower their gazes and they are allowed to look at them. It is written in Hanafi Fiqh book Fatawa Alamgiri (<a href="../../../images/Alamgiri_Awrah_slave_woman.jpg">link</a>):<em> "It is allowed to see the whole body of a slave woman of another person, except between her navel and the knees ... And all that is allowed to be seen, it is also allowed to be touched."</em> And it is written in the Book "Al-Sharh al-Saghir" of Maliki Fiqh (<a href="http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html">link</a>): فيرى الرجل من المرأة - إذا كانت أمة - أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة <strong>Translation:</strong> A man can see more of the body of a slave woman as compared to what she can see of a man. She is allowed only to see his hands and feet, while a man is allowed to see her whole body naked except for the part between her navel and knees.</li>
<li>And prohibiting women to talk with men, or both of them to interact with each other is also not modesty, but again an unnatural restriction. </li>
<li>These unnatural restrictions result only in the form of an extremely 'Frustrated' society. Please read our article: <a href="../women-and-hijab/1-.html"> The practice of Islamic Hijab and Modesty leads only to sexual frustration.</a></li>
<li>And in order to see the real destruction of these unnatural restrictions, please see the <a href="../hoaxes-of-the-quranic-miracles/100-.html">Incident of Ifk</a>, where people put the howdah of 'Aisha on the camel, while they thought 'Aisha was present there. But 'Aisha was not present there. This happened while Islam prohibits interaction between men and women, and thus people didn't even say "hello" to 'Aisha. This led to such devastating results where 2 tribes of Muslims were about to kill each other, and Muhammad was close to divorcing 'Aisha, and this whole drama lasted for a complete month. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, let us make it clear that: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>It is the RESPECT of women and their choices, which is counted as modesty. </em></strong></li>
<li>And the Western world is modest. It provided women with protection by demanding that men respect women and their choices. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId223301"></a>Islamic Apologists: Slave women were allowed to expose their chest/breasts, but it was not necessary</h3>
<p>Islamic apologists also come up with this excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The verses, narrations, and exegeses only state that the slave women were not allowed to cover their hair, which was the main distinguishing factor between free women and slave women. They were allowed to expose their chest/breasts, but it was not necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>This is not true.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is no Quranic verse or Hadith present which claims that it was the own personal choice of slave women either to expose their chests or to cover them. Islamic apologists must come up with proof for this claim. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Secondly, according to verse <a href="http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=33&amp;vid=59">33:59</a> and Ahadith it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilbāb">Jilbab جلبأب</a>, which was the main distinguishing factor between free and slave women. Slave women were not allowed to wear the Jilbab. Jilbab was a big sheet of garment, which was put on the head, and it covered the whole body along with breasts.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thirdly, slave women were indeed allowed to cover their head and hair by wearing <a href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21134/is-niqab-compulsory#:%7E:text=Khimar%20comes%20from%20the%20word,something%20else%20is%20called%20Khimar.">Khimaar خمأر</a> , which is a small "<strong>head scarf</strong>", which Arab men do wear still today. Covering the head was a per-Islamic tradition due to the heat in Arab area. Thus, Khimar was not the main distinguishing factor between free women and slave women. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Fourthly, the 'Awrah (nakedness) of slave woman is from the navel to the knee. Therefore, the main question is, why didn't Allah (i.e. Muhammad) <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">ORDER</strong> that it is <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">OBLIGATORY</strong> upon slave women to cover their breasts and body? What would have happened if slave women had to cover their breasts under these obligatory orders? Unfortunately, Islamic apologists don't answer this main and direct question. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Fifthly, yes some slave women tried to cover their breasts by wearing putting the Jilbab on their heads (covering their breasts too), but Umar Ibn Khattab started beating them and told them not to try to resemble free Muslim women. He compelled those slave women to remove the Jilbab from their heads, again exposing their breasts. Please read all the traditions about Umar Ibn Khattab above in the article where he is removing this Jilbab. Thus, it was not an option that slave women had either to expose or to cover their breasts. </p>
<p>Here are few Ahadith about Khimar and how slave women used to wear it:</p>
<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:275">Sahih Muslim, Hadith 275</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مَسَحَ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ <strong>وَالْخِمَارِ</strong> <br> Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiped over the socks and Khimar (Arabic Scarf)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that Khimar was only a head covering. </p>
<p>And 'Abdul Razzaq recorded in this book al-Musanif (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115185806/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?bk_no=73&amp;ID=520&amp;idfrom=4807&amp;idto=4820&amp;bookid=73&amp;startno=6">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>عبد الرزاق عن بن جريج قال بلغني عن أشياخ من أهل المدينة أن الخمر على الإماء إذا حضن وليس عليهن الجلابيب</p>
<p>Abd al-Razzaq narrated from Ibn Jarir who said: "I heard from the elders of Medina that when a slave girt started to menstruate, she would cover her head with Khimar, but not wear a Jilbab."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is written in Tafsir-e-Mazhari, under the commentary of this verse 24:31 (<a href="http://equranlibrary.com/tafseer/mazhari/24/31">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the Scholars are 'Unanimous اجماع' that this verse is only for the free (Muslim) women ... Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad deemed the nakedness of a slave woman from navel till knees. While Imam Abu Hanifa considered her stomach and back to be a part of her nakedness too. </p>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId793213"></a>An article by a Muslim Apologist (Abu Amina Elias), who denies that the breasts of slave women were naked</h2>
<p class="western">Of course, proofs are so abundant that the breasts of slave women in Islamic society were naked, that it is impossible for the Islamic apologists to refute all the proofs directly. </p>
<p class="western">Nevertheless, they tried to deceive the readers by bringing lame excuses from a few later coming Muslim scholars. You can read this complete article <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210121234557/https://www.abuaminaelias.com/slave-girls-naked-breasts/">here</a>. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This article is unable to bring a single proof from the Quran or Hadith against this unanimous practice of the early whole Islamic Community, where the breasts of slave women were kept naked.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In fact, this article is proof itself that later coming few Islamic Scholars were so much ashamed of this practice, that they tried to hide it by making lame excuses.</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This article presented the statements of the following Scholars, that who denied that slave women were naked during Muhammad's era. </p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Hazm">Ibn Hazm</a> (died 456 Hijri)</li>

<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hayyan_al-Gharnati">Abu Hayyan</a> (died 745 Hijri)</li>
</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">All of them came about 450 years after Muhammad. Ibn Hazm (died 456 Hijri) was the first one who went against the IJMA of all Salaf Muslims of the first 450 years. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And the second problem is that all of them belonged to the <strong>Zahiri Madhab.</strong> </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And all other Ulama (of 4 Sunni Fiqh) during their time and after them and until now deny them on the issue of the nakedness of a slave woman. </p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just look at <a class="mw-redirect" title="Tabi‘un" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi‘un">Tābi‘ūn</a> (i.e. the 2nd generation of Muslims after Sahaba), and Tabi' al-Tabi'in (i.e. 3rd generation of Muslims), like Abu Malik, Abu Saleh, Muawiyyah, Hassan, Siddi and Mujahid (see the discussion about verse 33:59 above in our article).</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just look at the fatwas of all 4 Sunni Imams of Fiqh.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just look at the practice of the whole Muslim community. Imam Malik personally disliked it but he was a witness himself that the whole Muslim community was practising it where the breasts of slave women were naked. Thus, Imam Malik was unable to convince the Caliph to stop this practice, as Malik was unable to present any proof from Quran and Sunnah against it.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even after Ibn Hazm and Ibn Taymiyyah (and all others who are mentioned in this article), the later coming Muslim Scholars like Ibn Kathir and Fiqh Scholars didn't give any importance to these lame excuses of Ibn Taymiyyah and to these other few Zahiri madhab followers and kept this view that breasts of slave women were naked in the Islamic society.</li>

</ul>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Yes, they do not have a single proof. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">While there are many Ahadith (mentioned above in our article), which are unanimously telling only one thing i.e. slave women were present there with naked breasts.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The deception of Islamic apologists is that they themselves are not able to present a single Hadith in their favour but deny all those reports which go against them. </p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In the whole article, only Abu Hayan, Ibn al-Qattan brought a single proof i.e. verse 33:59 and claimed that this verse prohibits the naked breasts of slave women. According to this article:</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is not counted as proof, but only their claim, which is based only upon their conjecture, as they failed in bringing any other proof from the Quran, or any other single Hadith as support of their claim. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In fact, this verse is refuting them itself as it is making a distinction between the free women and the slave women, as has been mentioned by all the rest of Muslims Scholars and Mufassirin (Quran Interpreters), and Tabaeen (2nd Generation Muslims) and Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat and took away the Jilbab from the slave-women only due to this verse. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Verse 33:59 is as under:</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We had already presented the detailed proofs and sayings of 2nd and 3rd generation of Muslims (i.e. <a class="mw-redirect" title="Tabi‘un" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi‘un">Tābi‘ūn</a> and Tabi' al-Tabi'in) and Muslim Scholars and Muffasirin and Fiqh Imams, and Ahadith, who are all denying this claim of Abu Hayyan and Ibn al-Qattan (see the details above in our article).</p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And these claims/conjectures of Ibn Hazm and Ibn Taymiyyah have no value as they have been refuted by Quranic verse 33:59 itself, where Quran is itself making a distinction between free Muslim women and the slave women by ordering only the free women to take the Jilbab (outer sheet).

<li class="western"><strong>Was there really no young and beautiful Arab or Persian of Black slave girls present during the time of the prophet Muhammad? </strong></li>
<li class="western"><strong>Were all of the young Arab, Persian and Black slave girls of the prophet’s era UGLY?</strong></li>
<li class="western">And how those young Araba and Persian of black slave women became equal to <strong>OLD</strong> women? Yes, old free women are not needed to follow the strict Hijab code, but they are yet not allowed to move in public with naked breast. Nevertheless, young slave women were present in public with naked breasts. </li>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This article claims that Albani wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is strange that some exegetes are fooled by these weak narrations, such that they adhere to the view restricting His saying ‘<strong>the believing women</strong>’ as free women to the exclusion of maidservants,</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As compared to Albani, there are Tabaeen (like Abu Malik, Abu Saleh, Muawiyyah, Hassan, Siddi and Mujahid) who all pointed out that in this verse the believers who are addressed are the free Muslim women, and this verse was itself revealed to make a distinction between the free and the slave woman.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">After Tabaeen, all the Fiqh Imams, and all the Quran Mufassirin of the first 450 years and then later till today (except for a few Zahiris) pointed out that this verse is indeed making a distinction and, in this verse, the "believing women" only mean the free women as only they had to take the jilbab. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, the conjecture of Albani has no value in front of these Tabaeen, and then Ijma of the whole Ummah for the first 500 years, and late too except for a few Zahiri Scholars.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, there are not "some exegetes", but ALL of them (except for a few Zahiris) accepted these traditions and the collective practice of Muslim Society proves that 'Awrah of a slave woman is only from navel to knee. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islamic apologists also claim that Albani declared all these Traditions as weak:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is strange that some exegetes are fooled by these weak narrations</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">While the reality is totally opposite to what Albani claims, as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> Neither are they "some exegetes", but almost ALL of them accepted these traditions.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And All the Fiqh Imams accepted these traditions.</li>
<li class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And in fact, it is no more a question of traditions, because it was the <strong>continuous practice</strong> of the whole Muslim society and in the first 450 years no one challenged it. The first one was Ibn Hazm who claimed otherwise, but he was unable to bring a single verse from Quran or single Hadith for his claim. </li>

Al-Qadhi said in "al-Jami'" that everything besides that (i.e. what is mentioned above) is 'awrah, because it is usually not exposed, similar to what is beneath the navel.

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This article tried to cast doubts about the wrongdoing of Umar Ibn Khattab by writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anas reported:</p>
<p>قَالَ رَأَى عُمَرُ أَمَةً لَنَا مُتَقَنِّعَةً فَضَرَبَهَا وَقَالَ لَا تَشَبَّهِي بِالْحَرَائِرِ</p>
<p>Umar saw one of our maidservants wearing a veil and he flogged her. Umar said: Do not resemble free women.</p>
<p>(Source: Muṣannaf Ibn Abī Shaybah 6/236)</p>
<p>The authenticity of this report, through various chains of authority, is questionable. Even if it is authentic, it does not prove anything about the limits of a maidservant’s nakedness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already provided multiple traditions above, which have been authenticated by Muslims Scholars themselves, and all of them prove that indeed Umar Ibn Khattab beat the slave woman for taking the Jilbab and hiding her body. And indeed it proves that the breasts of slave women became naked after the removal of Jilbab/Muqna, while it was the only garment they used to hide their naked bodies and breasts. </p>
<p>Islamic apologists claim that the tradition says the Umar uncovered the head/hairs of the slave girl and not her breast. </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Covering the head/hair was not a part of the 'Awrah (nakedness) of the slave women. Their 'Awrah was only from the navel till the knees.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The slave girls used the Jilbab for covering the whole body and it was Jilbab that was the sign of distinction between the free woman and the slave woman.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Therefore, when Umar took away the Jilbab, then not only breasts became naked, but also the head/hairs, but it was not the issue.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId920556"></a>8th Issue: Excuse that slave women made their breasts naked only while they were physically working</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The article claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> It seems to have been a concession granted as a way of lightening their workload ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It is a lame excuse. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Covering the naked breasts is not a problem in doing physical work.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And when Umar Ibn Khattab beat the slave woman for wearing Jilbab, then she was not working at that time, but she was only walking in public with a Hijab. Nevertheless, Umar Ibn Khattab still took away her Hijab and told her not to resemble the free Muslim women by taking a Hijab. </p>

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Islam not only allowed the customers to watch the naked breast and bodies of the slave women but they were also allowed to touch their bodies, including the private parts like breasts, buttocks and thighs (whole body, except for vagina). For example, Imam Bayhiqi wrote in his book Sunan al-Kubra (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150909140424/http://library.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?bk_no=673&amp;pid=332183&amp;hid=9985">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>عن نافع ، عن ابن عمر ” أنه كان إذا اشترى <strong>جارية</strong> كشف عن ساقها ووضع يده بين ثدييها و على عجزها<br>Translation:<br>According to Nafi', from Ibn 'Umar, it is narrated that when he would purchase a female slave, he would uncover her leg and place his hand between her breasts and on her private part.</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">But <a href="https://debunkingantiislamists.quora.com/Naked-Slave-Girls-in-Islam?comment_id=6388996&amp;comment_type=3">this Website</a> of Islamic apologists denied it, and presented the following excuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The word used in this Hadith is “<strong>jariya جارية</strong>” , and Jariya refers to a very young girl that has the ability to run around, not even a girl who attained puberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is a strange excuse. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Firstly, even if Ibn Umar and Muslim customers were placing their hands on the naked breasts and buttocks of a young girl, still that is disgusting enough to leave the whole religion of Islam. </p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Secondly, it is a false excuse, and Allah/Muhammad allowed to dishonour even the fully grown-up slave girls and slave women by touching their naked bodies.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The word "Jariya" does not mean small girl (as Islamic apologists claimed), but it means fully grown-up slave girl. We can see it in hundreds of other Ahadith. For example, let us see this word in a Hadith that is present in Sahih Muslim, Book of Marriage (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1439a">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">عَنْ جَابِرٍ، أَنَّ رَجُلاً، أَتَى رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَقَالَ إِنَّ لِي <strong>جَارِيَةً</strong> هِيَ خَادِمُنَا وَسَانِيَتُنَا وَأَنَا أَطُوفُ عَلَيْهَا وَأَنَا أَكْرَهُ أَنْ تَحْمِلَ ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ‏"‏ اعْزِلْ عَنْهَا إِنْ شِئْتَ فَإِنَّهُ سَيَأْتِيهَا مَا قُدِّرَ لَهَا ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فَلَبِثَ الرَّجُلُ ثُمَّ أَتَاهُ فَقَالَ إِنَّ الْجَارِيَةَ قَدْ حَبِلَتْ ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ‏"‏ قَدْ أَخْبَرْتُكَ أَنَّهُ سَيَأْتِيهَا مَا قُدِّرَ لَهَا ‏"‏ ‏.‏</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hadith_narrated">
<blockquote>
<p>Jabir  reported that a man came to Allah's Messenger  and said: I have a slave-girl (<strong>جَارِيَةً</strong>) who is our servant and she carries water for us <strong>and I have intercourse with her</strong>, but I do not want her to conceive. He said: Practise 'azl, if you so like, but what is decreed for her will come to her. The person stayed back (for some time) and then came and said: <strong>The girl has become pregnant,</strong> whereupon he said: I told you what was decreed for her would come to her.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId213736"></a>10th Issue: Imam Malik's statement</h3>
<p>Islamic apologists also presented this argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Malik was asked: Do you dislike a servant-girl to go out bare-chested? Malik said: Yes, and I would punish her for that. (Source: Mawāhib al-Jalīl 1/501)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already made it clear about Imam Malik that it was his "Personal Liking/Disliking", but it has nothing to do with Quran/Hadith and Islamic Sharia.</p>
<p>You could see that despite this personal disliking, Malik is unable to present a single verse from Quran or to bring a single Hadith which claims otherwise.</p>
<p>That is why when Malik wrote a letter to Sultan and demanded to ban slave women with naked breasts in the public, the Sultan denied it while Malik failed to provide any proof from Quran/Sunnah. </p>
<p>The Maliki Scholar Imam Ibn Abi Zayd (died 386 Hijri) wrote in his book "al-Jameh" (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170106054129/http://www.ummah.com/forum/showthread.php?408719-A-female-slaves-awrah-questions">link</a>), and also see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210303222328/https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/367498/slave-women-did-not-walk-bare-breasted-during-lifetime-of-prophet-sallallaahu-alayhi-wa-sallam">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><strong>"He (i.e. al-Imam Malik ibn Anas) strongly disapproved of the behavior of the slave women of al-Medinah in going out uncovered above the lower garment (i.e with naked breasts). He said: "I have spoken to the Sultan about it, but I have not received a reply."</strong></blockquote>
<p>In fact, these statements of Imam Malik are themselves proof of the continuous practice of the whole Muslim society where slave women were moving in public with naked breasts. </p>
<p>In fact, when it came to giving Fatwa about Islamic Sharia, then Imam Malik himself accepted that breasts are not included in the 'Awrah of slave women. </p>
<p>And it is written in the Book "Al-Sharh al-Saghir" of Maliki Fiqh (<a href="http://islamport.com/d/2/mlk/1/15/490.html">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>فيرى الرجل من المرأة - إذا كانت أمة - أكثر مما ترى منه لأنها ترى منه الوجه والأطراف فقط، وهو يرى منها ما عدا ما بين السرة والركبة، لأن عورة الأمة مع كل واحد ما بين السرة والركبة</blockquote>
<blockquote>A man can see more of the body of a slave woman as compared to what she can see of a man. She is allowed only to see his hands and feet, while a man is allowed to see her whole body naked except for the part between her navel and knees.</blockquote>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId910404"></a>Islamic apologists: Taba'in became corrupt and they initiated the Bidah (innovation) of naked breasts of slave women</h3>
<p>The incident of Imam Malik itself became a strong witness that slave women were present in public with naked breasts.</p>
<p>Thus Islamic apologists made up this excuse (on their own) that the breasts of slave women were not naked during the time of Muhammad and Sahaba, but then Tabi'in (i.e. the Muslim generation which followed Sahaba) became corrupt and they went against Islamic Sharia, and they initiated the Bidah (innovation) of keeping slave-women naked in the public. See this fatwa at <a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/367498/slave-women-did-not-walk-bare-breasted-during-lifetime-of-prophet-sallallaahu-alayhi-wa-sallam"> Islamweb.Net</a>. </p>
<p>This is a ridiculous claim and a conjecture without any proof. </p>
<p>There is an Ijma of ALL the Salaf Muslims of the first 450 years that it was not a Bidah, but indeed Islamic Sharia. </p>
<p>How can these modern Muslim apologists blame ALL of their Salaf Muslims of the first 450 years of UNANIMOUSLY indulging in misguidance, and introducing an innovation of keeping the breasts of slave women naked in public? </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId826710"></a>Islamic apologist: Touching the body parts of a slave woman is Ok, while she is standing there for sale</h3>
<p>Unbelievable, but it is true that Islamic apologists do come up with this argument that it is the right of customers to check the product before buying it, and thus there is no harm in touching the naked body of slave-girl, while she is standing there for sale.</p>
<p>The problem is that the "base" of Islam is wrong, as it turns the captive women and small children into slaves. </p>
<p>These poor women and children had no role in the wars, and they were innocent, but still, Muhammad turned them into slaves for the whole of their lives, and then also made their rape Halal, and then their sale Halal too, and then making them naked too, and then touching their private parts too (except for vagina). Not only those women and small girls/boys were made slaves for their entire life, but their later coming generations were also born automatically as slaves, due to the evil of "Slavery by Birth" in Islam. </p>
<p>Nothing good could come out if your base is itself evil and corrupt. </p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId333028"></a>Is Allah really All-Knowing? Why then He forgot to mention in the Quran that slave women have to cover their breasts?</h2>
<p>While Allah was UNABLE to explicitly state in the Quran that slave women should cover their breasts, resulting in ALL Muslims of the first 4 centuries being misguided and unanimously agreeing (IJMA) that slave girls could move in public with naked breasts.</p>
<p>As a result, the unfortunate slave women had to endure this neglect from the so-called all-knowing and all-wise Allah for 13 centuries of Islamic Slavery's history until Kafir Western intervention forcefully abolished slavery in Islamic countries.</p>
<p>Allah filled the Quran, a huge book, with boasts about his powers and praises, yet failed to mention a single verse about the naked breasts of slave women.</p>
<p>Who should be held responsible for the suffering endured by millions of slave women?</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId514607"></a><a href="https://www.islamweb.net/en/article/183231/the-concept-of-tawatur">Tawattur</a> (the widespread practice) in actions of Sahaba and Tabaeen in keeping thousands of slave women with naked breasts in public</h2>
<p>This action, known as Tawattur, was consistently observed by the Muslim Ummah.</p>
<p>Imam Malik, being a Tabi'i himself in Medina, witnessed the actions of the Tabi'in in Medina, where they kept the breasts of thousands of slave women naked.</p>
<p>Not only Imam Malik, but also other jurists before him witnessed this widespread practice among the Sahaba and Tabi'in.</p>
<p>For instance, Abu Hanifa, who was also a Tabi'i, observed the Tawattur among the Sahaba, as <strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">they kept thousands of slave women with naked breasts in public.</strong></p>

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Aisha was fortunate in a way that she was handed over to Muhammad at the age of nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While the actual Islamic Ruling is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Even a breastfed small baby girl can be married, and her husband can undress her, and take every kind of sexual pleasure with her naked body (like kissing her naked body and rubbing his penis in her thighs to ejaculate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;And if the Husband thinks she is strong enough at any age before puberty (may it be 6 or 7 years or later) to bear the pain of penetration in her vagina, then he can also penetrate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt; And if the husband makes a mistake and harms the minor girl by penetrating her vagina, still he has committed no sin or crime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic website &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/islamweb.net&quot;&gt;islamweb.net&lt;/a&gt; gave this fatwa (link &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160129102417/http://fatwa.islamweb.net/fatwa/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;amp;lang=A&amp;amp;Id=78529&amp;amp;Option=FatwaId&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/minor_wife_pleasure_islamwebNet.pdf&quot;&gt;2, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210410223048/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/77718/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shamela.ws/book/27107/72618&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;فإنه لا حرج في تقبيل الزوجة ‌الصغيرة بشهوة ‌والمفاخذة ونحو ذلك ولو كانت لا تطيق الجماع، وقد بين العلماء رحمهم الله تعالى أن الأصل جواز استمتاع الرجل بزوجته كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر، وذكروا في ذلك استمناءه بيدها ومداعبتها وتقبيلها وغير ذلك&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no issue in the sexual kissing, thighing..etc of a minor wife, even if she can't yet endure sexual intercourse. Scholars have stated that the default ruling is that a man can enjoy his wife however he wants as long as no harm is caused. The examples they mentioned for this include masturbating with her hand, fondling, kissing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another one of the largest Websites for Muslims is Islamonline.net, which says a similar thing (link &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20100125211912/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-Arabic-Ask_Scholar/FatwaA/FatwaA&amp;amp;cid=1122528623306&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/minor_wife_thighing2.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فإنه لا ضررَ في الإنزالِ بين فخذي الصغيرة التي لا تطيقُ الجماع وتتضررُ به إذا كان ذلك الإنزالُ بدونِ إيلاج، وقد بَيَّنَ العلماءُ أن الأصلَ هو جوازُ استمتاعِ الرجلِ بزوجتِه كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر&lt;br&gt;There is no problem if husband rubs his penis between the thighs of minor girl in order to ejaculate the sperm, even the minor girl does not possess the ability for penetration... According to the Islamic Scholars husband is allowed to enjoy the minor wife in every possible way till the time she is not harmed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId872200&quot;&gt;Verse 4:3 also proves marriage with small girls is fully allowed in Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId942418&quot;&gt;Due to penetration in minor girls, their vagina and anus could become one &amp;amp; the husband will decide when to penetrate her vagina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId563676&quot;&gt;Handing over Captive Minor girls to Jihadists and Buying minor slave girls from Islamic Bazaars of Slavery for sexual pleasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId580394&quot;&gt;Dangers for minor girls if they are used for sexual pleasures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId10537&quot;&gt;Few modern Muslim Preachers (and the Quranists) try to use verse 4:6 to deny marriage to minor girls&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId186814&quot;&gt;Muslim Preachers also claim that the Arabic word “Nisaa'” cannot refer to minor girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId959348&quot;&gt;Either the Quran supports marriage with minor girls or it's linguistically imperfect and flawed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A free minor girl may have some protection that her father does not hand her over to her husband till she is 9 years old, or strong enough to bear the penetration. Nevertheless, minor slave girls in Islam were totally vulnerable and they had no fathers there to protect them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim men got their hands upon minor slave girls by making them captives through wars, or directly buying them from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (also known as the younger Imam Malik) wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A slave-mother and her baby could be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) after baby has his two molar tooth (i.e. about 6 months)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A mother could only weep the tears of blood if her 6 months old baby is separated from her and sold in the slave market and then used for sexual pleasure by the Muslim owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (who is also known as the younger Imam Malik), writes in his Fiqh book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;واستبراء الامة في انتقال الملك حيضة انتقل الملك ببيع أو هبة أو سبي أو غير ذلك. ومن هي في حيازته قدحاضت عنده ثم إنه اشتراها فلا استبراء عليها إن لم تكن تخرج. واستبراء الصغيرة في البيع إن كانت توطأ ثلاثة أشهر&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Istibra (i.e. waiting period) of a slave woman during the transfer of ownership occurs through sale, gift, capture, or other means. If a person possesses a slave woman who is menstruating, and then he purchases her, there is no requirement for Istibra (i.e. waiting period) ....&lt;strong&gt; As for the Istibra (waiting period) of a minor slave girl through sale is concerned, then it is three months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Imam Ibn Qayyam al-Jawziyya recorded (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150512090314/http://islamport.com/w/qym/Web/3181/859.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;في الفصول روى عن أحمد في رجل خاف أن تنشق مثانته من الشبق أو تنشق انثياه لحبس الماء في زمن رمضان يستخرج الماء ولم يذكر بأي شيء يستخرجه قال: “وعندي أنه يستخرجه بما لا يفسد صوم غيره كاستمنائه بيده أو ببدن زوجته أو أمته غير الصائمة فإن كان له أمة طفلة أو صغيرة استمنى بيدها وكذلك الكافرة ويجوز وطؤها فيما دون الفرج فإن أراد الوطء في الفرج مع إمكان إخراج الماء بغيره فعندي أنه لا يجوز لأن الضرورة إذا رفعت حرام ما وراءها&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmed said about a man who feared that sperm would flow from his penis or that his testicles were unable to retain semen during Ramadan, he can ejaculate. But he didn’t say with what. In my opinion, he must release it with what would not spoil the fast of others. Like masturbating with his hand, or against the body of his wife or a slave who is not fasting. &lt;strong&gt;If he has a child or a small slave, let him masturbate with her hand&lt;/strong&gt;. The Same for the unbelieving woman, he can penetrate her but not in her vagina. But if he wants to penetrate her vagina while he has other options to ejaculate, this would not be allowed in my opinion. If the need is fulfilled, it is forbidden to go beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam handed over captive minor girls to Jihadists, where they were alone in their tents and fully on their mercy. There was no one to stop them from raping these small captive girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was a regular practice of Muhammad's Companions to rape minor PRISONER girls. Ali raped a minor captive girl on the same night when she was made captive after the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Istibra &lt;/em&gt;is a period of sexual abstinence required till the first period of the captive girl is over. This is to ensure no confusion on paternity. Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.&lt;br&gt;As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/waq110421/06_110426#page/n125/mode/1up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah 16906:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chapter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;: &lt;/i&gt;Regarding the man who buys a slave-girl, may he (immediately) take pleasure in anything of her, and does it exclude the vulva or not? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waki narrated to us from Ali bin al-Mubarak, from Yahya bin Abi Kathir, from Ikrimah, regarding the man who buys a prepubescent slave-girl, even one younger than that. He said, &quot;There is nothing wrong with touching her before observing &lt;i&gt;Istibra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Imam Bukhari recorded the following traditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;ID=4081&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;flag=1&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari (link)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ولم ير الحسن بأسا أن يقبلها أو يباشرها. وقال ابن عمر ـ رضى الله عنهما ـ إذا وهبت الوليدة التي توطأ أو بيعت أو عتقت فليستبرأ رحمها بحيضة، ولا تستبرأ العذراء. وقال عطاء لا بأس أن يصيب من جاريته الحامل ما دون الفرج.&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;Al-Hasan did not see any harm in kissing or having sexual intercourse with a female slave. Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: &quot;If a female slave who has been engaged in sexual intercourse is given as a gift, sold, or freed, she should be purified by waiting for her menstrual cycle. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;virgin&lt;/span&gt; does not require purification &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0005ff; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;(i.e. the minor girls are also virgins)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;  And Atta said if a slave woman had become pregnant (from the earlier owner/husband), then still pleasure could be derived from whole of her body, except for her vagina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Risala is a famous treatise of Maliki fiqh (jurisprudence). It says the same i.e. virgin woman (including virgin minor girls) don't need any waiting period and can be raped immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/lawbase/risalah_maliki/book33.html&quot;&gt;The Risalah, 33:5 (Maliki Fiqh)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istibra' is observed in the case of a slavegirl who changes ownership. It is one menstruation. Ownership changes by selling, giving away, capture, or any other way. If the woman menstruates after being in the possession of the new master (i.e. she was a minor girl) before he has bought her, then &lt;strong&gt;she does not have to observe an istibra' if she has not gone out&lt;/strong&gt;. The istibra' for a child when she is sold is three months as it is for a woman who no longer menstruates. &lt;strong&gt;There is no istibra' for a woman who has never had intercourse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please imagine the profound trauma endured by the small girls who experienced the unimaginable horrors inflicted upon them. In a single day, they tragically lost their fathers and brothers to Muslims. Shortly thereafter, they were forcibly expelled from their homes, subjected to looting by the same perpetrators. To compound their suffering, they were then cruelly torn apart from their mothers on that very same night and then they were raped by Jihadists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad didn't even grant the poor small girls the period of one month to come out of the shock of the killing of their fathers and brothers (like the Jews/Christians did), before raping them &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;(link).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any God really exists, then can He ever bring such shame to humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many people have lost all their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and all their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; due to religious brainwashing. They still come out and start defending Islam against this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ugliest crime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which it committed against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the practice of Companions and all Muslims of the last 1400 years, till the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secular non-religious West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; saved humanity against these evil religious practices of slavery and raping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId151488&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Verse 65:4 proves marriage with small prepubescent girls is Halal Allah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain juncture, it becomes necessary to transcend the 1400-year-old tenets of Sharia law. There are no alternative paths available to us. For example, the Quran says that even a minor girl (under the age of 9) could be married and penetrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quranwebsite.com/text55/065___at_talaq.html&quot;&gt;Quran 65:4&lt;/a&gt;) And if you are in doubt about those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, (you should know that) their waiting period is three months,&lt;b&gt; and the same applies to those (minor girls) who have not menstruated as yet&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modoudi's Tafseer of verse 65:4 (&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=65&amp;amp;verse=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They may not have menstruated as yet &lt;b&gt;either because of young age&lt;/b&gt;, or delayed menstrual discharge as it happens in the case of some women, the waiting-period of such a woman is the same as of the woman, who has stopped menstruation, that is three months from the time divorce was pronounced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here, one should bear in mind the fact that according to the explanations given in the Qur'an the question of the waiting period arises in respect of the women with whom marriage may have been consummated, for there is no waiting-period in case divorce is pronounced before the consummation of marriage. (Al-Ahzab: 49). Therefore, making mention of the waiting-period for the girls who have not yet menstruated, clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl in marriage at this age but it is also permssible for the husband to consummate marriage with her. Now, obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Qur'an has held as permissible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just in case someone tries to claim that Abul A'la al-Maududi is a modern scholar, then here are a few excerpts from other classical exegetes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/afiefh/&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubay bin Ka`b said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger! Some women were not mentioned in the Qur'an, the young (who yet not menstruate), the old (who don't menstruate due to old age) and the pregnant women.'' Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah (ie. verse 65:4) وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ {Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses (due to young age}&lt;br&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a simpler narration than this one from Ubay bin Ka`b who said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger! When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur'an. There are the young (who yet not menstruate), the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.' Later on, this Ayah 65:4 was revealed,  وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ   (Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses (due to young age).)''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;والآثار الدالة على اشتهار الزواج المبكر في عهد الصحابة من غير نكير كثيرة  فقد  زوج علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله عنه ابنته أم كلثوم من عمر بن الخطاب  رضي الله عنه  وقد ولدت له قبل موت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم  وتزوجها عمر رضي الله عنه وهي صغيرة لم تبلغ بعد، رواه عبد الرزاق في المصنف، وابن سعد في &quot;الطبقات&quot;. وعن عروة بن الزبير: أن الزبير رضي الله عنه زوج ابنة له صغيرة حين ولدت. رواه سعيد بن منصور في سننه، وابن أبي شيبة في المصنف بإسناد صحيح. وقال الشافعي في &quot;كتاب الأم&quot;: وزوج غير واحد من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ابنته صغيرة. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many evidences of the popularity of early marriage during the time of the Companions. Ali ibn Abi Talib, married his daughter Umm Kulthum to Omar ibn al-Khattab. She was born to him before the death of the Prophet. Omar, may God be pleased with him, married her when she was young and had not reached puberty yet. It was narrated by Abd al-Razzaq in al-Musannaf, and Ibn Sa`d in al-Tabaqat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is narrated on the authority of Urwa bin Al-Zubayr: Al-Zubayr, may God be pleased with him, married his young daughter when she was born. It was narrated by Saeed bin Mansour in his Sunan, and Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf &lt;strong&gt;with an authentic chain of narrators&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Shafi’i said in his book “Kitab al-Umm”: And more than one of the companions of the Messenger of God, married their young daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the largest Muslim Fatwa website Islam Questions Answers says there is a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #fc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus (i.e. Ijma)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; upon it among all the Salaf (i.e. early) generations of Muslims:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/12708&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/12708&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage to a young girl &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; she reaches puberty is permissible according to sharee’ah, and it was narrated that there was scholarly &lt;b&gt;consensus &lt;/b&gt;on this point (i.e. All jurists along with 4 Imams agree upon it) ... &lt;b&gt;The scholars are (also) unanimously agreed (Ijma) that a father may marry off his young (minor) daughter without consulting her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If she has not reached the age of puberty, &lt;strong&gt;then her father has the sole right to arrange her marriage and does not have to ask her permission&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to a virgin who is still a minor, there is no difference of opinion concerning her (i.e., that her father may marry her off even if she objects). Ibn al-Mundhir said: Every scholar from whom we learned was agreed that it is permissible for a man to marry off his virgin daughter who is still a minor, if he marries her to someone who is compatible, &lt;strong&gt;and it is permissible for him to marry her off even if she objects and refuses&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;i&gt;Al-Mughni&lt;/i&gt;, 9/398&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;قال ابن عبد البر  رحمه الله :&quot; أجمع العلماء على أن للأب أن يزوِّج ابنته الصغيرة ، ولا يشاورها، وأن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم تزوَّج عائشة بنت أبي بكر ، وهي صغيرة بنت ست سنين ، أو سبع سنين ، أنكحه إياها أبوها &quot; انتهى من &quot; الاستذكار &quot; ( 16 / 49 ). وقال ابن حجر – رحمه الله - : &quot; والبكر الصغيرة يزوِّجها أبوها اتفاقاً ، إلا من شذ &quot; انتهى من &quot; فتح الباري &quot; ( 9 / 239 ) . ....  وإذا زوج الأب ابنته الصغيرة غير البالغة، فلا خيار لها إذا بلغت .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ... Ibn Abd al-Barr, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;Scholars unanimously agree that a father has the right to marry off his young daughter without her consent, and he is not required to consult her. The Prophet, peace be upon him, married Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, when she was a young girl of six or seven, and her father married her to him.&quot; (See &quot;Al-Istidhkar&quot; 16/49). Ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;The young virgin girl can be married off by her father without her consent, except in rare cases.&quot; (See &quot;Fath al-Bari&quot; 9/239) ... If the father marries off his non-adult daughter, she has no choice once she reaches adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ٰImam Nawawi wrote in his Sharh of Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://seekersguidance.org/answers/shafii-fiqh/marriage-with-a-minor/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وأما وقت زفاف الصغيرة المزوجة والدخول بها : فإن اتفق الزوج والولي على شيء لا ضرر فيه على الصغيرة : عُمل به ، وإن اختلفا : فقال أحمد وأبو عبيد : تجبر على ذلك بنت تسع سنين دون غيرها ، وقال مالك والشافعي وأبو حنيفة : حدُّ ذلك أن تطيق الجماع ، ويختلف ذلك باختلافهن ، ولا يضبط بسنٍّ ، وهذا هو الصحيح&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the sleeping with a minor age wife and having intercourse with her, if the husband and the guardian of the wife agreed upon something that is not harmful for the minor age wife, it is legitimate and if they did not agree upon then Ahmad and Aboo Ubayd say that &lt;strong&gt;if she is at nine years of age she can be forced to (do intercourse with her husban)&lt;/strong&gt;, not the younger ones, &lt;strong&gt;and Malik and Shafi’i and Aboo Hanifah say that the criteria is that she can bear intercourse (even if she is younger than 9)&lt;/strong&gt;, and the differences of opinion about this issue comes from these scholars. But the correct opinion is that it does not depend upon age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus of Sahaba (companions) that a father can wed his minor daughter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://al-maktaba.org/book/31621/13351&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;نُقل الإجماع على جواز تزويج الأب البكر الصغيرة – على الأقل إجماع الصحابة – وممن نقل الإجماع: الإمام أحمد في ” المسائل ” – رواية صالح – (3/ 129) والمروزي في ” اختلاف العلماء ” (ص 125)، وابن المنذر في ” الإجماع ” (ص91) وابن عبد البر في ” التمهيد “، والبغوي في ” شرح السنة ” (9/ 37) والنووي في ” شرح مسلم ” (9/ 206) وابن حجر في” الفتح ” (12/ 27)، والباجي في ” المنتقى ” (3/ 272)، وابن العربي في ” عارضة الأحوذي ” (5/ 25)، والشنقيطي في ” مواهب الجليل ” (3/ 27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The consensus was transmitted on the permissibility of a father marrying off the minor Virgin girl&lt;/strong&gt; – at least the consensus of the Companions – and among those who transmitted the consensus were: Imam Ahmad in “Al-Masseel” – riwayat salih – (3/129) and Al-Marwazi in “aikhtilaf al-ulama” (p. 125), and Ibn Al-Mundhir in “al-ijma” (p. 91) and Ibn Abd al-Barr in “Al-Tamheed”, al-Baghawi in “Sharh al-Sunnah” (9/37), al-Nawawi in “Sharh Muslim” (9/206), Ibn Hajar in “Al-Fath” (12/27), and al-Baji in “Al-Muntaqa” (3/272), Ibn al-Arabi in “Ardah al-Ahwadhi” (5/25), and al-Shinqiti in “Mawahib al-Jaleel” (3/27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId238305&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Imam Bukhari on Nikah with minor child girl:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bukhari gave the following heading to the chapter about the marriage of Aisha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Marriage (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;باب إِنْكَاحِ الرَّجُلِ وَلَدَهُ الصِّغَارَ&lt;br&gt;A man can give his minor daughter in marriage &lt;br&gt;لِقَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى: {وَاللاَّئِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ} فَجَعَلَ عِدَّتَهَا ثَلاَثَةَ أَشْهُرٍ قَبْلَ الْبُلُوغِ.&lt;br&gt;Allah said (in Quran 65:4): ... and for those minor girls who didn't start mensturating. This means their waiting period is 3 months&lt;br&gt;عَنْ عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَزَوَّجَهَا وَهْىَ بِنْتُ سِتِّ سِنِينَ، وَأُدْخِلَتْ عَلَيْهِ وَهْىَ بِنْتُ تِسْعٍ، وَمَكَثَتْ عِنْدَهُ تِسْعًا‏.‏&lt;br&gt;Narrated `Aisha:&lt;br&gt;that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani writes in his commentary of Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210810235618/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=9288&amp;amp;idto=9289&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2819&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot; يجوز تزويج الصغيرة بالكبير إجماعا ولو كانت في المهد&quot;&lt;br&gt;There is a consensus&lt;strong&gt; (Ijma)&lt;/strong&gt; that an adult man can marry any minor girl, even if she is &lt;strong&gt;so small that she is in a cradle&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bukhari also recorded that a woman had already become a grandmother at the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/0/2524/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%D8%BA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;باب بلوغ الصبيان وشهادتهم وقول الله تعالى وإذا بلغ الأطفال منكم الحلم فليستأذنوا وقال مغيرة احتلمت وأنا ابن ثنتي عشرة سنة وبلوغ النساء في الحيض لقوله عز وجل واللائي يئسن من المحيض من نسائكم إلى قوله أن يضعن حملهن وقال الحسن بن صالح أدركت جارة لنا جدة بنت إحدى وعشرين سنة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Hasan bin Saleh said, &quot;I saw one of my neighbors who had become a grandmother at the age of twenty-one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId872200&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Verse 4:3 also proves marriage with small girls is fully allowed in Islam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a minor orphan girl is in the guardianship of any man, then he can marry her even without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(Quran 4:3) And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Nikah (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150429191013/http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated Aisha&quot;:&lt;br&gt;(regarding) the Verse: 'And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans...' (4.3) &lt;strong&gt;It is about the (minor) orphan girl who is in the custody of a man (due to her minor age)&lt;/strong&gt; who is her guardian, and he intends to marry her because of her wealth, but he treats her badly and does not manage her property fairly and honestly. Such a man should marry women of his liking other than her.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId942418&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due to penetration in minor girls, their vagina and anus can become one &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a risk of permanent damage to a minor girl due to penetration. Her vagina and anus may become one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We read in &lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-0-0&quot;&gt;Fatawa Alamgiri (Authentic Book of Hanafi Fiqh) (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_1FRfMxEAy__7c8vezYv9qP&quot; href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210511052345if_/https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/184874820_951508122055452_3185058016773267725_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;amp;ccb=1-3&amp;amp;_nc_sid=730e14&amp;amp;_nc_ohc=lA1__sB1cLwAX9-ecS6&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx&amp;amp;oh=58e06e6045d59d845b51f994c7745c3c&amp;amp;oe=60BF5E30&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-1-0&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-2-0&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; Sharia Law book titled &quot;Reliance of the Traveler&quot;( or Umdat al Salik in Arabic), which is one of the most renowned classical manuals of fiqh, on page 592 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/fistula_Reliance_traveler.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Indemnity for Bodily Injuries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A full indemnity is also paid for injuries which paralyze these members,&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; or for injuring the peritoneal wall between the vagina and rectum (anus) so they become one aperture&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forced penetration by an adult man to the underage girl causes her small vagina to rupture and rip apart up to her rectum. It is known as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=vaginal+fistula&amp;amp;oq=vagin&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i512l4j69i60j69i61.1646j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Fistula&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in medical terminology.&lt;br&gt;You can imagine the pain that the little girl suffers because of this action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another Sharia book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062229/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Behisti_Zewar.jpg&quot;&gt;Heavenly Ornaments or Bahisti Zewar (page 50)&lt;/a&gt; that also mentions this type of injury. The paragraph talks about ghusl or ritual washing after having intercourse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;If a woman is underage but not so small that if one has intercourse with her &lt;strong&gt;there is a fear of the vaginal tissues tearing to such an extent that the vagina and anus will virtually come together&lt;/strong&gt;; then by the insertion of the glans of the penis into her vagina ghusl will become Fardh (i.e. obligatory) on the man if he has reached the age of puberty. However, if there is the aforementioned fear in a very minor girl, then mere insertion of the penis does not render ghusl obligatory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if the man is an adult and he is worried that inserting his genitalia into a prepubescent, or infant or a baby girl can cause the tearing of the vagina to the anus, then just insert the head of his penis. .... Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can read a similar explanation from another Sharia book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062510/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Digest_Muhammad_law.jpg&quot;&gt;A Digest of Moohummudan Law, Part II, translated by Neil Baillie. This is about the Marriage Law in Islam, page 26&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;When a man has had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of nine years, &lt;strong&gt;and has ruptured the parts (i.e. her vagina, tearing apart because of what the adult man did to her)&lt;/strong&gt;. It is unlawful for him to have further connection with her (i.e. he cannot have a sex with her), &lt;strong&gt;but she is not released from her ties, if connected with him by marriage or slavery&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that if the vagina ruptures, then the man should not continue the coitus. &lt;strong&gt;But that doesn't mean that the girl can divorce the man, if the man is her husband, or that the girl is free if the man is her slave master&lt;/strong&gt;. If no rupture has taken place, the prohibition is not incurred according to the most valid opinion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This means that if no rupture happens, then the man can go ahead to continue with the coitus. But if the rapture happens, then such a girl cannot have sex her entire life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This is DOUBLE cruelty against the poor minor girl:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;First and foremost, she is condemned to endure the anguish and physical trauma of the fistula throughout her entire existence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, she is trapped in a perpetual state of being unable to liberate herself from him through divorce, forced to confront the presence of the abhorrent individual who violated and subjected her to such excruciating torment. This inflicts not only physical agony but also profound mental anguish upon her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the rupture incident is mentioned repeatedly in many Sharia books, means that such horrific accidents happen often during child marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shia Islam: vagina and anus becoming one due to penetration in minor girls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia Islam also allows marriage with a minor girl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia Imam Khomeini wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamicvirtues.com/2013/12/28/deriving-sexual-pleasure-from-infants/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;مسألة 12 : لا يجوز وطء الزوجة قبل إكمال تسع سنين ، دواما كان النكاح أو منقطعا ، و أما سائر الاستمتاعات كاللمس بشهوة و الضم و التفخيذ فلا بأس بها حتى فى الرضيعة ولو وطئها قبل التسع ولم يفضها لم يترتّب عليه شي‏ء غير الإثم على الأقوى، وإن أفضاها - بأن جعل مسلكي البول والحيض واحدا أو مسلكي الحيض والغائط واحدا - حرم عليه وطؤها أبدا، لكن على الأحوط في الصورة الثانية. وعلى أيّ حال لم تخرج عن زوجيّته على الأقوى، فيجري عليها أحكامها من التوارث وحرمة الخامسة وحرمة اُختها معها وغيرها&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tahreer al-Waseelah, volume 2, page 343&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue #12: It is not permissible to have sexual intercourse (with one’s wife) before she reaches 9 years in age, be it in Nikaah (permanent marriage) or Mut’a (temporary marriage). As for all other pleasures such as lustful touch, embracing, and thighing, there is no problem in it, even if she is a suckling baby. A man having intercourse with a girl younger than nine years of age has not committed a crime, but only an infraction, if the girl is not permanently damaged by vagina and anus becoming one. If the girl, however, is permanently damaged, the man must provide for her all her life. But this girl will not count as one of the man's four permanent wives. He also is not permitted to marry the girl's sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Shia Imam Sistani wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2368/&quot;&gt;Ruling 2428&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If a person marries a non-bālighah girl, it is unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her until she has completed nine lunar years. However, if he does have sexual intercourse with her before then, it will not be unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her after she reaches bulūgh even if she has developed a cloacal abnormality (the meaning of which was explained in Ruling 2399). And if she has developed a cloacal abnormality, he must pay her blood money (diyah), which is equivalent to the blood money for killing a human being, and he must also pay for her living expenses forever, even after divorce. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, even if that girl marries someone else after getting divorced [he must still pay for her living expenses] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2367/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloacal abnormality explained in #2399 point 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; “the woman had a cloacal abnormality, meaning that her urethral opening and vagina had become one [vesicovaginal fistula], or her vagina and anus had become one [rectovaginal fistula], or all three had become one [persistent cloaca], …”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the condition of 9 years is only a precaution, while Shia Imams also allowed penetrating her vagina if she is even younger than 9 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read this news (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-childbride-idUSBRE98910N20130910/&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text__text__1FZLe text__dark-grey__3Ml43 text__regular__2N1Xr text__small__1kGq2 body__full_width__ekUdw body__small_body__2vQyf article-body__paragraph__2-BtD&quot; data-testid=&quot;paragraph-0&quot;&gt;SANAA (Reuters) - An eight-year-old Yemeni girl died of internal bleeding on her wedding night after marrying a man five times her age, a social activist and two local residents said, in a case that has caused an outcry in the media and revived debate about child brides. Arwa Othman, head of Yemen House of Folklore and a leading rights campaigner, said the girl, identified only as Rawan, was married to a 40-year-old man late last week in the town of Meedi in Hajjah province in northwestern Yemen. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId580394&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dangers for minor girls if they are used for sexual pleasures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly: The rate of death among “Teen Mothers” and their babies is the highest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole internet is full of this information (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rate of death of Teen Mothers is the highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the rate of death among their babies is also the highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And not only the death rate, but these children also suffer highly from other mental and physical handicaps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And birth becomes very often complicated and OPERATION has to be performed instead of natural birth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly: Psychiatrists are WISER than Allah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam sends a minor girl to an old man of the age of her father and grandfather so that that old man can take sexual pleasure from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Psychiatrists claim that separating a minor girl from her parents, and then sending her alone to an old man for being used as a sexual object, causes a huge psychological depression to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Allah claims that he is the All-Wisest, and he does not do any injustice to such a minor girl, and she is not depressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, who is truthful? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah or these Psychologists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId10537&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Does verse 4:6 prohibit marriage with minor girls?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an Ijma (إجماع i.e. CONSENSUS) of Muslim Ummah that marriage with a minor girl is allowed. But in the present century, few modern Muslim Preachers (and the Quranists, i.e. those who reject Hadith) have started denying it. They are trying to misuse verse 4:6 as an argument to deny marriage to minor girls in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=6&quot;&gt;4:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;وَٱبْتَلُوا۟&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And test the orphans until when they reached the age of marriage (Nikah), then if you perceive in them sound judgement then deliver to them their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Modern Muslim preachers claim that one gets sound judgement about his wealth when one is already an adult person. Thus, this means that Islam prescribed that one can marry only after becoming an adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the word &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Nikah&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah&quot;&gt;Nikah&lt;/a&gt; has a double meaning in the Arabic language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the Islamic Sharia, &quot;Nikah&quot; is a terminology, whose meaning in Islamic Sharia is “marriage”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the literal meaning of “Nikah” in the Arabic language is &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;Nikah (Sexual Consummation of Marriage)&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah_%28Sexual_Consummation_of_Marriage%29&quot;&gt;To do Sexual Intercourse&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes even more evident from another verse of Quran 17:34:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.34?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 17:34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ &lt;b&gt;أَشُدَّهُۥ&lt;/b&gt; ۚ&lt;br&gt;Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of &lt;b&gt;full strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word أَشُدَّهُ (full strength) in this verse means the age when young boys and girls start feeling the desire/strength to do sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as Shar'i Nikah (marriage) is concerned, then there is no condition present in it of reaching the أَشُدَّهُ (i.e. Full Strength to do the act of intercourse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the proof is that prophet Muhammad himself did the Shar'i Nikah with 'Aisha, when she was only 6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And no one tests a 6 years old child for handing over his/her property to him/her, as a 6-year-old child has neither أَشُدَّهُ (Strength/Desire) nor he/she has any kind of “sound judgement” to look after his/her property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Shar'i Nikah has nothing to do with the أَشُدَّهُ (strength), as Muhammad did this Shar'i Nikah with 6 years 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, even at the age of 9, when 'Aisha finally came to the house of Muhammad for the consummation of marriage, she was still not mentally sound enough to look after any property or business. It is evident from the following hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-6130/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 6130:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, according to Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a girl reaches puberty, then she herself gets the right to give her consent for the marriage or to deny the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if she is a minor or prepubescent girl, then her father/guardian could wed her to anyone, even without her consent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if she is prepubescent and also an orphan, then her guardian has the right to wed her with himself (even without her consent), in order to get her property and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5064/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5064:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated 'Urwa: that he asked `Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! &lt;b&gt;(This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr (bride-dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr&lt;/b&gt;, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) &lt;b&gt;to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage&lt;/b&gt;, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reasons that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no longer considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islamqa.com, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet, also refutes these modern Muslim preachers regarding verse 6:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse 4:6 explains that an orphan’s money is given to him/her after they reach puberty and attain sound judgement. What’s meant by sound judgment is sound management of money. This can only happen after puberty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Reaching Nikah” mentioned in the verse means reaching puberty which can be known through sings such as menstruation for females and the growth of pubic hair. The verse used the expression “reaching Nikah” to actually mean “reaching puberty” because in most cases, it’s adults who perform Nikah. But this doesn’t mean that it’s not possible for non-adults to perform Nikah, which is permissible as proven by the Quran, Sunnah and the consensus of scholars. Plus, the same Surah and the same context of verses proves it (the permissibility of child marriage). (The verse that speaks about giving an orphan his money when he/she reaches Nikah is verse no.6) Verse no.3 says: “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. ”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse proves it’s allowed to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of Allah's Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning women..' (4.127) “&lt;a class=&quot;external free&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This shows it’s allowed to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId186814&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_Arabic_word_.E2.80.9CNisaa.27.E2.80.9D_does_not_refer_to_young_females&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Muslim Preachers also claim that the Arabic word “Nisaa'” cannot refer to minor girls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Muslim preachers also come up with this excuse that the word &lt;i&gt;Nisaa'&lt;/i&gt;  refers only to mature, adult women, therefore 65:4 cannot be talking about pre-pubescent females.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-13&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Child_Marriage_in_the_Qur%27an#cite_note-13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This linguistic argument does not hold water, even just on the basis of the Qur'an itself as a text. The word merely means “women/females” and can refer to mixed groups of women of various ages, as the English &quot;female&quot; or &quot;women.&quot; Here are some verses that use the word &lt;i&gt;&quot;nisaa'&quot;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.49?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 2:49&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ ۚ وَفِى ذَٰلِكُم بَلَآءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your (newborn) sons and let your women-folk (i.e. newborn girls) live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 7:127&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ أَتَذَرُ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُۥ لِيُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَءَالِهَتَكَ ۚ قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْىِۦ نِسَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَٰهِرُونَ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Said the chiefs of Pharaoh’s people: “Wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods?” He said: “Their (newborn) male children will we slay; (only) their (newborn) females will we save alive; and we have over them (power) irresistible.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above verses, the word &lt;i&gt;&quot;Nisaa'&quot;&lt;/i&gt; is referring to female infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Quran used the expression “Nisaa’ orphans” to mean “female orphans”. Orphans cannot be adults which means non-adults can be included in the word Nisaa’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;‏ويستفتونك في النساء قل الله يفتيكم فيهن ومايتلى عليكم في الكتاب في يتامى النساء اللاتي لاتؤتونهن ماكتب لهن وترغبون ان تنكحوهن والمستضعفين من الولدان وان تقوموا لليتامى بالقسط وماتفعلوا من خير فان الله كان به عليماThey consult thee concerning women. Say: Allah giveth you decree concerning them, and the Scripture which hath been recited unto you (giveth decree), concerning female orphans and those unto whom ye give not that which is ordained for them though ye desire to marry them, and (concerning) the weak among children, and that ye should deal justly with orphans. Whatever good ye do, lo! Allah is ever Aware of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic Excuse: Shariah didn't stipulate any age for Nikah, so it is a matter of Ijtehaad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Islamic apologist website wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/476539/ruling-on-giving-in-marriage-a-young-girl&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic principle is that there is nothing in Shari‘ah that stipulates a particular age of marriage for the man or the woman. The issue in question, which is related to specifying a particular age for marriage, falls under a general matter, which is: Does the guardian have the right to restrict what is permissible for the public interest? This is one of the matters of ijtihad, so no one should disapprove of it for what his ijtihad has led him to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy on the marriage of young girls reads: &quot;The age of marriage for young girls is determined with the permission of the judge and the matter is left (entrusted) to the ruler in each country according to the circumstances of time, place, and age, in a way that achieves the interest of all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is against Islamic rule that the Halal of Allah cannot be made Haram by any man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Muhammad was not allowed to make Halal of Allah haram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed Muhammad didn't make it to Haram in the incident where a foster father married his adopted daughter for her beauty and wealth. At maximum, Muhammad asked such men in the Quran to do justice and pay full Haq Mahr to their adopted minor daughters, but nothing was made illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why Sahaba were raping minor captive and minor slave girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Islamic history of 14 centuries, no one stipulated sex with minor girls to be Haram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId959348&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Either the Quran supports marriage with minor girls or it's linguistically imperfect and flawed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Just think about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;How can billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years make a mistake about this verse?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Billions of Muslims believe in this Quran from their hearts. They read this Quran and pondered upon it day and night, but still, the modern Islam apologists blame they got misguided despite reading this Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Didn't the Quran claim that its verses are CLEAR and EASY to understand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;But if the modern Quranists/Islamic Apologists claim that the billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years got misguided despite pondering upon it day and night, then it means that Quran is telling a lie that its verses are clear and EASY to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;How can then we believe in such a book which tells lies and make false claims?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at the Quran, which claims that its verses are Clear and Easy to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;easy to understand&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.17&quot;&gt;54:17&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;manifest&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2&quot;&gt;27:1-2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/12.2&quot;&gt;12:2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However according to modern Muslim apologists and the Quranists, then this Quran was neither a guide nor mercy for billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years, as minor girls were being wed and being used for sexual pleasures. And millions of minor slave girls were also bought from the slave markets, and used for sexual pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is then responsible for the plight of these minor girls?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Were really Muslims of the last 1400 years responsible, who were reading this Quran and pondering upon it, and despite that came to absolutely wrong and horrible conclusions? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Or it was the so-called Allah, who was UNABLE to reveal a single clear verse about the rights of minor girls? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Aisha was fortunate in a way that she was handed over to Muhammad at the age of nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While the actual Islamic Ruling is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic website &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/islamweb.net&quot;&gt;islamweb.net&lt;/a&gt; gave this fatwa (link &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160129102417/http://fatwa.islamweb.net/fatwa/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;amp;lang=A&amp;amp;Id=78529&amp;amp;Option=FatwaId&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/minor_wife_pleasure_islamwebNet.pdf&quot;&gt;2, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210410223048/https://www.islamweb.net/ar/fatwa/77718/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shamela.ws/book/27107/72618&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;فإنه لا حرج في تقبيل الزوجة ‌الصغيرة بشهوة ‌والمفاخذة ونحو ذلك ولو كانت لا تطيق الجماع، وقد بين العلماء رحمهم الله تعالى أن الأصل جواز استمتاع الرجل بزوجته كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر، وذكروا في ذلك استمناءه بيدها ومداعبتها وتقبيلها وغير ذلك&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no issue in the sexual kissing, thighing..etc of a minor wife, even if she can't yet endure sexual intercourse. Scholars have stated that the default ruling is that a man can enjoy his wife however he wants as long as no harm is caused. The examples they mentioned for this include masturbating with her hand, fondling, kissing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A free minor girl may have some protection that her father does not hand her over to her husband till she is 9 years old, or strong enough to bear the penetration. Nevertheless, minor slave girls in Islam were totally vulnerable and they had no fathers there to protect them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim men got their hands upon minor slave girls by making them captives through wars, or directly buying them from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (also known as the younger Imam Malik) wrote in his Maliki Fiqh Book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;ولا يفرق بين الام وولدها في البيع حتى يثغر&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A slave-mother and her baby could be separated from each other and sold (in the Bazars of slavery) after baby has his two molar tooth (i.e. about 6 months)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A mother could only weep the tears of blood if her 6 months old baby is separated from her and sold in the slave market and then used for sexual pleasure by the Muslim owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abdullah Ibn Abi Zayd (who is also known as the younger Imam Malik), writes in his Fiqh book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20210918074920/http://www.islamicbook.ws/asol%5Cmaliki/mtn-alrsalt.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;واستبراء الامة في انتقال الملك حيضة انتقل الملك ببيع أو هبة أو سبي أو غير ذلك. ومن هي في حيازته قدحاضت عنده ثم إنه اشتراها فلا استبراء عليها إن لم تكن تخرج. واستبراء الصغيرة في البيع إن كانت توطأ ثلاثة أشهر&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Istibra (i.e. waiting period) of a slave woman during the transfer of ownership occurs through sale, gift, capture, or other means. If a person possesses a slave woman who is menstruating, and then he purchases her, there is no requirement for Istibra (i.e. waiting period) ....&lt;strong&gt; As for the Istibra (waiting period) of a minor slave girl through sale is concerned, then it is three months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Imam Ibn Qayyam al-Jawziyya recorded (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150512090314/http://islamport.com/w/qym/Web/3181/859.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;في الفصول روى عن أحمد في رجل خاف أن تنشق مثانته من الشبق أو تنشق انثياه لحبس الماء في زمن رمضان يستخرج الماء ولم يذكر بأي شيء يستخرجه قال: “وعندي أنه يستخرجه بما لا يفسد صوم غيره كاستمنائه بيده أو ببدن زوجته أو أمته غير الصائمة فإن كان له أمة طفلة أو صغيرة استمنى بيدها وكذلك الكافرة ويجوز وطؤها فيما دون الفرج فإن أراد الوطء في الفرج مع إمكان إخراج الماء بغيره فعندي أنه لا يجوز لأن الضرورة إذا رفعت حرام ما وراءها&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmed said about a man who feared that sperm would flow from his penis or that his testicles were unable to retain semen during Ramadan, he can ejaculate. But he didn’t say with what. In my opinion, he must release it with what would not spoil the fast of others. Like masturbating with his hand, or against the body of his wife or a slave who is not fasting. &lt;strong&gt;If he has a child or a small slave, let him masturbate with her hand&lt;/strong&gt;. The Same for the unbelieving woman, he can penetrate her but not in her vagina. But if he wants to penetrate her vagina while he has other options to ejaculate, this would not be allowed in my opinion. If the need is fulfilled, it is forbidden to go beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam handed over captive minor girls to Jihadists, where they were alone in their tents and fully on their mercy. There was no one to stop them from raping these small captive girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was a regular practice of Muhammad's Companions to rape minor PRISONER girls. Ali raped a minor captive girl on the same night when she was made captive after the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Istibra &lt;/em&gt;is a period of sexual abstinence required till the first period of the captive girl is over. This is to ensure no confusion on paternity. Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.&lt;br&gt;As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waki narrated to us from Ali bin al-Mubarak, from Yahya bin Abi Kathir, from Ikrimah, regarding the man who buys a prepubescent slave-girl, even one younger than that. He said, &quot;There is nothing wrong with touching her before observing &lt;i&gt;Istibra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ولم ير الحسن بأسا أن يقبلها أو يباشرها. وقال ابن عمر ـ رضى الله عنهما ـ إذا وهبت الوليدة التي توطأ أو بيعت أو عتقت فليستبرأ رحمها بحيضة، ولا تستبرأ العذراء. وقال عطاء لا بأس أن يصيب من جاريته الحامل ما دون الفرج.&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;Al-Hasan did not see any harm in kissing or having sexual intercourse with a female slave. Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: &quot;If a female slave who has been engaged in sexual intercourse is given as a gift, sold, or freed, she should be purified by waiting for her menstrual cycle. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;virgin&lt;/span&gt; does not require purification &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0005ff; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;(i.e. the minor girls are also virgins)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;  And Atta said if a slave woman had become pregnant (from the earlier owner/husband), then still pleasure could be derived from whole of her body, except for her vagina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Risala is a famous treatise of Maliki fiqh (jurisprudence). It says the same i.e. virgin woman (including virgin minor girls) don't need any waiting period and can be raped immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/lawbase/risalah_maliki/book33.html&quot;&gt;The Risalah, 33:5 (Maliki Fiqh)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istibra' is observed in the case of a slavegirl who changes ownership. It is one menstruation. Ownership changes by selling, giving away, capture, or any other way. If the woman menstruates after being in the possession of the new master (i.e. she was a minor girl) before he has bought her, then &lt;strong&gt;she does not have to observe an istibra' if she has not gone out&lt;/strong&gt;. The istibra' for a child when she is sold is three months as it is for a woman who no longer menstruates. &lt;strong&gt;There is no istibra' for a woman who has never had intercourse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please imagine the profound trauma endured by the small girls who experienced the unimaginable horrors inflicted upon them. In a single day, they tragically lost their fathers and brothers to Muslims. Shortly thereafter, they were forcibly expelled from their homes, subjected to looting by the same perpetrators. To compound their suffering, they were then cruelly torn apart from their mothers on that very same night and then they were raped by Jihadists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad didn't even grant the poor small girls the period of one month to come out of the shock of the killing of their fathers and brothers (like the Jews/Christians did), before raping them &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;(link).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any God really exists, then can He ever bring such shame to humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many people have lost all their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and all their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; due to religious brainwashing. They still come out and start defending Islam against this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ugliest crime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which it committed against humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the practice of Companions and all Muslims of the last 1400 years, till the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secular non-religious West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; saved humanity against these evil religious practices of slavery and raping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId151488&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Verse 65:4 proves marriage with small prepubescent girls is Halal Allah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain juncture, it becomes necessary to transcend the 1400-year-old tenets of Sharia law. There are no alternative paths available to us. For example, the Quran says that even a minor girl (under the age of 9) could be married and penetrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quranwebsite.com/text55/065___at_talaq.html&quot;&gt;Quran 65:4&lt;/a&gt;) And if you are in doubt about those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, (you should know that) their waiting period is three months,&lt;b&gt; and the same applies to those (minor girls) who have not menstruated as yet&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modoudi's Tafseer of verse 65:4 (&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=65&amp;amp;verse=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They may not have menstruated as yet &lt;b&gt;either because of young age&lt;/b&gt;, or delayed menstrual discharge as it happens in the case of some women, the waiting-period of such a woman is the same as of the woman, who has stopped menstruation, that is three months from the time divorce was pronounced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here, one should bear in mind the fact that according to the explanations given in the Qur'an the question of the waiting period arises in respect of the women with whom marriage may have been consummated, for there is no waiting-period in case divorce is pronounced before the consummation of marriage. (Al-Ahzab: 49). Therefore, making mention of the waiting-period for the girls who have not yet menstruated, clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl in marriage at this age but it is also permssible for the husband to consummate marriage with her. Now, obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Qur'an has held as permissible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubay bin Ka`b said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger! Some women were not mentioned in the Qur'an, the young (who yet not menstruate), the old (who don't menstruate due to old age) and the pregnant women.'' Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah (ie. verse 65:4) وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ {Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses (due to young age}&lt;br&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a simpler narration than this one from Ubay bin Ka`b who said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger! When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur'an. There are the young (who yet not menstruate), the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.' Later on, this Ayah 65:4 was revealed,  وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ   (Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses (due to young age).)''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;والآثار الدالة على اشتهار الزواج المبكر في عهد الصحابة من غير نكير كثيرة  فقد  زوج علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله عنه ابنته أم كلثوم من عمر بن الخطاب  رضي الله عنه  وقد ولدت له قبل موت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم  وتزوجها عمر رضي الله عنه وهي صغيرة لم تبلغ بعد، رواه عبد الرزاق في المصنف، وابن سعد في &quot;الطبقات&quot;. وعن عروة بن الزبير: أن الزبير رضي الله عنه زوج ابنة له صغيرة حين ولدت. رواه سعيد بن منصور في سننه، وابن أبي شيبة في المصنف بإسناد صحيح. وقال الشافعي في &quot;كتاب الأم&quot;: وزوج غير واحد من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ابنته صغيرة. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many evidences of the popularity of early marriage during the time of the Companions. Ali ibn Abi Talib, married his daughter Umm Kulthum to Omar ibn al-Khattab. She was born to him before the death of the Prophet. Omar, may God be pleased with him, married her when she was young and had not reached puberty yet. It was narrated by Abd al-Razzaq in al-Musannaf, and Ibn Sa`d in al-Tabaqat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is narrated on the authority of Urwa bin Al-Zubayr: Al-Zubayr, may God be pleased with him, married his young daughter when she was born. It was narrated by Saeed bin Mansour in his Sunan, and Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf &lt;strong&gt;with an authentic chain of narrators&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Shafi’i said in his book “Kitab al-Umm”: And more than one of the companions of the Messenger of God, married their young daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the largest Muslim Fatwa website Islam Questions Answers says there is a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #fc0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consensus (i.e. Ijma)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; upon it among all the Salaf (i.e. early) generations of Muslims:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/12708&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/12708&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage to a young girl &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; she reaches puberty is permissible according to sharee’ah, and it was narrated that there was scholarly &lt;b&gt;consensus &lt;/b&gt;on this point (i.e. All jurists along with 4 Imams agree upon it) ... &lt;b&gt;The scholars are (also) unanimously agreed (Ijma) that a father may marry off his young (minor) daughter without consulting her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another place, this same Saudi Mufti writes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/27305&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/27305&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If she has not reached the age of puberty, &lt;strong&gt;then her father has the sole right to arrange her marriage and does not have to ask her permission&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to a virgin who is still a minor, there is no difference of opinion concerning her (i.e., that her father may marry her off even if she objects). Ibn al-Mundhir said: Every scholar from whom we learned was agreed that it is permissible for a man to marry off his virgin daughter who is still a minor, if he marries her to someone who is compatible, &lt;strong&gt;and it is permissible for him to marry her off even if she objects and refuses&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;i&gt;Al-Mughni&lt;/i&gt;, 9/398&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;قال ابن عبد البر  رحمه الله :&quot; أجمع العلماء على أن للأب أن يزوِّج ابنته الصغيرة ، ولا يشاورها، وأن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم تزوَّج عائشة بنت أبي بكر ، وهي صغيرة بنت ست سنين ، أو سبع سنين ، أنكحه إياها أبوها &quot; انتهى من &quot; الاستذكار &quot; ( 16 / 49 ). وقال ابن حجر – رحمه الله - : &quot; والبكر الصغيرة يزوِّجها أبوها اتفاقاً ، إلا من شذ &quot; انتهى من &quot; فتح الباري &quot; ( 9 / 239 ) . ....  وإذا زوج الأب ابنته الصغيرة غير البالغة، فلا خيار لها إذا بلغت .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ... Ibn Abd al-Barr, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;Scholars unanimously agree that a father has the right to marry off his young daughter without her consent, and he is not required to consult her. The Prophet, peace be upon him, married Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, when she was a young girl of six or seven, and her father married her to him.&quot; (See &quot;Al-Istidhkar&quot; 16/49). Ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;The young virgin girl can be married off by her father without her consent, except in rare cases.&quot; (See &quot;Fath al-Bari&quot; 9/239) ... If the father marries off his non-adult daughter, she has no choice once she reaches adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a fatwa from a Hanafi Deoband Mufti (&lt;a href=&quot;https://darulifta-deoband.com/home/ur/Womens-Issues/68723&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Question:&lt;br&gt;Is it allowed to penetrate into a wife who is still a minor-girl? ....&lt;br&gt;Answer:&lt;br&gt;....Yes, it is allowed to penetrate into a wife who is still a minor-girl, nevertheless guardians of the minor girl should keep it in mind and marry her by keeping this issue in their minds ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ٰImam Nawawi wrote in his Sharh of Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://seekersguidance.org/answers/shafii-fiqh/marriage-with-a-minor/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وأما وقت زفاف الصغيرة المزوجة والدخول بها : فإن اتفق الزوج والولي على شيء لا ضرر فيه على الصغيرة : عُمل به ، وإن اختلفا : فقال أحمد وأبو عبيد : تجبر على ذلك بنت تسع سنين دون غيرها ، وقال مالك والشافعي وأبو حنيفة : حدُّ ذلك أن تطيق الجماع ، ويختلف ذلك باختلافهن ، ولا يضبط بسنٍّ ، وهذا هو الصحيح&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the sleeping with a minor age wife and having intercourse with her, if the husband and the guardian of the wife agreed upon something that is not harmful for the minor age wife, it is legitimate and if they did not agree upon then Ahmad and Aboo Ubayd say that &lt;strong&gt;if she is at nine years of age she can be forced to (do intercourse with her husban)&lt;/strong&gt;, not the younger ones, &lt;strong&gt;and Malik and Shafi’i and Aboo Hanifah say that the criteria is that she can bear intercourse (even if she is younger than 9)&lt;/strong&gt;, and the differences of opinion about this issue comes from these scholars. But the correct opinion is that it does not depend upon age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus of Sahaba (companions) that a father can wed his minor daughter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://al-maktaba.org/book/31621/13351&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;نُقل الإجماع على جواز تزويج الأب البكر الصغيرة – على الأقل إجماع الصحابة – وممن نقل الإجماع: الإمام أحمد في ” المسائل ” – رواية صالح – (3/ 129) والمروزي في ” اختلاف العلماء ” (ص 125)، وابن المنذر في ” الإجماع ” (ص91) وابن عبد البر في ” التمهيد “، والبغوي في ” شرح السنة ” (9/ 37) والنووي في ” شرح مسلم ” (9/ 206) وابن حجر في” الفتح ” (12/ 27)، والباجي في ” المنتقى ” (3/ 272)، وابن العربي في ” عارضة الأحوذي ” (5/ 25)، والشنقيطي في ” مواهب الجليل ” (3/ 27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The consensus was transmitted on the permissibility of a father marrying off the minor Virgin girl&lt;/strong&gt; – at least the consensus of the Companions – and among those who transmitted the consensus were: Imam Ahmad in “Al-Masseel” – riwayat salih – (3/129) and Al-Marwazi in “aikhtilaf al-ulama” (p. 125), and Ibn Al-Mundhir in “al-ijma” (p. 91) and Ibn Abd al-Barr in “Al-Tamheed”, al-Baghawi in “Sharh al-Sunnah” (9/37), al-Nawawi in “Sharh Muslim” (9/206), Ibn Hajar in “Al-Fath” (12/27), and al-Baji in “Al-Muntaqa” (3/272), Ibn al-Arabi in “Ardah al-Ahwadhi” (5/25), and al-Shinqiti in “Mawahib al-Jaleel” (3/27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId238305&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Imam Bukhari on Nikah with minor child girl:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bukhari gave the following heading to the chapter about the marriage of Aisha:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Marriage (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;باب إِنْكَاحِ الرَّجُلِ وَلَدَهُ الصِّغَارَ&lt;br&gt;A man can give his minor daughter in marriage &lt;br&gt;لِقَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى: {وَاللاَّئِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ} فَجَعَلَ عِدَّتَهَا ثَلاَثَةَ أَشْهُرٍ قَبْلَ الْبُلُوغِ.&lt;br&gt;Allah said (in Quran 65:4): ... and for those minor girls who didn't start mensturating. This means their waiting period is 3 months&lt;br&gt;عَنْ عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَزَوَّجَهَا وَهْىَ بِنْتُ سِتِّ سِنِينَ، وَأُدْخِلَتْ عَلَيْهِ وَهْىَ بِنْتُ تِسْعٍ، وَمَكَثَتْ عِنْدَهُ تِسْعًا‏.‏&lt;br&gt;Narrated `Aisha:&lt;br&gt;that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani writes in his commentary of Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210810235618/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=9288&amp;amp;idto=9289&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=2819&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot; يجوز تزويج الصغيرة بالكبير إجماعا ولو كانت في المهد&quot;&lt;br&gt;There is a consensus&lt;strong&gt; (Ijma)&lt;/strong&gt; that an adult man can marry any minor girl, even if she is &lt;strong&gt;so small that she is in a cradle&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Bukhari also recorded that a woman had already become a grandmother at the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/content/0/2524/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%D8%BA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;باب بلوغ الصبيان وشهادتهم وقول الله تعالى وإذا بلغ الأطفال منكم الحلم فليستأذنوا وقال مغيرة احتلمت وأنا ابن ثنتي عشرة سنة وبلوغ النساء في الحيض لقوله عز وجل واللائي يئسن من المحيض من نسائكم إلى قوله أن يضعن حملهن وقال الحسن بن صالح أدركت جارة لنا جدة بنت إحدى وعشرين سنة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Hasan bin Saleh said, &quot;I saw one of my neighbors who had become a grandmother at the age of twenty-one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId872200&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Verse 4:3 also proves marriage with small girls is fully allowed in Islam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a minor orphan girl is in the guardianship of any man, then he can marry her even without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(Quran 4:3) And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Nikah (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150429191013/http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated Aisha&quot;:&lt;br&gt;(regarding) the Verse: 'And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans...' (4.3) &lt;strong&gt;It is about the (minor) orphan girl who is in the custody of a man (due to her minor age)&lt;/strong&gt; who is her guardian, and he intends to marry her because of her wealth, but he treats her badly and does not manage her property fairly and honestly. Such a man should marry women of his liking other than her.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId942418&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due to penetration in minor girls, their vagina and anus can become one &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a risk of permanent damage to a minor girl due to penetration. Her vagina and anus may become one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We read in &lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-0-0&quot;&gt;Fatawa Alamgiri (Authentic Book of Hanafi Fiqh) (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_1FRfMxEAy__7c8vezYv9qP&quot; href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210511052345if_/https://scontent-dus1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/184874820_951508122055452_3185058016773267725_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;amp;ccb=1-3&amp;amp;_nc_sid=730e14&amp;amp;_nc_ohc=lA1__sB1cLwAX9-ecS6&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent-dus1-1.xx&amp;amp;oh=58e06e6045d59d845b51f994c7745c3c&amp;amp;oe=60BF5E30&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-1-0&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;4jr4r-2-0&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; Sharia Law book titled &quot;Reliance of the Traveler&quot;( or Umdat al Salik in Arabic), which is one of the most renowned classical manuals of fiqh, on page 592 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/fistula_Reliance_traveler.jpg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Indemnity for Bodily Injuries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A full indemnity is also paid for injuries which paralyze these members,&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; or for injuring the peritoneal wall between the vagina and rectum (anus) so they become one aperture&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forced penetration by an adult man to the underage girl causes her small vagina to rupture and rip apart up to her rectum. It is known as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=vaginal+fistula&amp;amp;oq=vagin&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i512l4j69i60j69i61.1646j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Fistula&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in medical terminology.&lt;br&gt;You can imagine the pain that the little girl suffers because of this action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another Sharia book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062229/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Behisti_Zewar.jpg&quot;&gt;Heavenly Ornaments or Bahisti Zewar (page 50)&lt;/a&gt; that also mentions this type of injury. The paragraph talks about ghusl or ritual washing after having intercourse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;If a woman is underage but not so small that if one has intercourse with her &lt;strong&gt;there is a fear of the vaginal tissues tearing to such an extent that the vagina and anus will virtually come together&lt;/strong&gt;; then by the insertion of the glans of the penis into her vagina ghusl will become Fardh (i.e. obligatory) on the man if he has reached the age of puberty. However, if there is the aforementioned fear in a very minor girl, then mere insertion of the penis does not render ghusl obligatory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if the man is an adult and he is worried that inserting his genitalia into a prepubescent, or infant or a baby girl can cause the tearing of the vagina to the anus, then just insert the head of his penis. .... Unbelievable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can read a similar explanation from another Sharia book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230527062510/https://atheism-vs-islam.com/images/fistula_Digest_Muhammad_law.jpg&quot;&gt;A Digest of Moohummudan Law, Part II, translated by Neil Baillie. This is about the Marriage Law in Islam, page 26&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;When a man has had sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of nine years, &lt;strong&gt;and has ruptured the parts (i.e. her vagina, tearing apart because of what the adult man did to her)&lt;/strong&gt;. It is unlawful for him to have further connection with her (i.e. he cannot have a sex with her), &lt;strong&gt;but she is not released from her ties, if connected with him by marriage or slavery&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that if the vagina ruptures, then the man should not continue the coitus. &lt;strong&gt;But that doesn't mean that the girl can divorce the man, if the man is her husband, or that the girl is free if the man is her slave master&lt;/strong&gt;. If no rupture has taken place, the prohibition is not incurred according to the most valid opinion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This means that if no rupture happens, then the man can go ahead to continue with the coitus. But if the rapture happens, then such a girl cannot have sex her entire life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This is DOUBLE cruelty against the poor minor girl:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;First and foremost, she is condemned to endure the anguish and physical trauma of the fistula throughout her entire existence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, she is trapped in a perpetual state of being unable to liberate herself from him through divorce, forced to confront the presence of the abhorrent individual who violated and subjected her to such excruciating torment. This inflicts not only physical agony but also profound mental anguish upon her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the rupture incident is mentioned repeatedly in many Sharia books, means that such horrific accidents happen often during child marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shia Islam: vagina and anus becoming one due to penetration in minor girls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia Islam also allows marriage with a minor girl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shia Imam Khomeini wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://islamicvirtues.com/2013/12/28/deriving-sexual-pleasure-from-infants/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;مسألة 12 : لا يجوز وطء الزوجة قبل إكمال تسع سنين ، دواما كان النكاح أو منقطعا ، و أما سائر الاستمتاعات كاللمس بشهوة و الضم و التفخيذ فلا بأس بها حتى فى الرضيعة ولو وطئها قبل التسع ولم يفضها لم يترتّب عليه شي‏ء غير الإثم على الأقوى، وإن أفضاها - بأن جعل مسلكي البول والحيض واحدا أو مسلكي الحيض والغائط واحدا - حرم عليه وطؤها أبدا، لكن على الأحوط في الصورة الثانية. وعلى أيّ حال لم تخرج عن زوجيّته على الأقوى، فيجري عليها أحكامها من التوارث وحرمة الخامسة وحرمة اُختها معها وغيرها&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tahreer al-Waseelah, volume 2, page 343&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue #12: It is not permissible to have sexual intercourse (with one’s wife) before she reaches 9 years in age, be it in Nikaah (permanent marriage) or Mut’a (temporary marriage). As for all other pleasures such as lustful touch, embracing, and thighing, there is no problem in it, even if she is a suckling baby. A man having intercourse with a girl younger than nine years of age has not committed a crime, but only an infraction, if the girl is not permanently damaged by vagina and anus becoming one. If the girl, however, is permanently damaged, the man must provide for her all her life. But this girl will not count as one of the man's four permanent wives. He also is not permitted to marry the girl's sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Shia Imam Sistani wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sistani.org/english/book/48/2368/&quot;&gt;Ruling 2428&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If a person marries a non-bālighah girl, it is unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her until she has completed nine lunar years. However, if he does have sexual intercourse with her before then, it will not be unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse with her after she reaches bulūgh even if she has developed a cloacal abnormality (the meaning of which was explained in Ruling 2399). And if she has developed a cloacal abnormality, he must pay her blood money (diyah), which is equivalent to the blood money for killing a human being, and he must also pay for her living expenses forever, even after divorce. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, even if that girl marries someone else after getting divorced [he must still pay for her living expenses] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the condition of 9 years is only a precaution, while Shia Imams also allowed penetrating her vagina if she is even younger than 9 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read this news (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-childbride-idUSBRE98910N20130910/&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId580394&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dangers for minor girls if they are used for sexual pleasures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly: The rate of death among “Teen Mothers” and their babies is the highest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole internet is full of this information (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rate of death of Teen Mothers is the highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the rate of death among their babies is also the highest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And not only the death rate, but these children also suffer highly from other mental and physical handicaps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And birth becomes very often complicated and OPERATION has to be performed instead of natural birth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly: Psychiatrists are WISER than Allah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam sends a minor girl to an old man of the age of her father and grandfather so that that old man can take sexual pleasure from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Psychiatrists claim that separating a minor girl from her parents, and then sending her alone to an old man for being used as a sexual object, causes a huge psychological depression to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Allah claims that he is the All-Wisest, and he does not do any injustice to such a minor girl, and she is not depressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, who is truthful? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah or these Psychologists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId10537&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Does verse 4:6 prohibit marriage with minor girls?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an Ijma (إجماع i.e. CONSENSUS) of Muslim Ummah that marriage with a minor girl is allowed. But in the present century, few modern Muslim Preachers (and the Quranists, i.e. those who reject Hadith) have started denying it. They are trying to misuse verse 4:6 as an argument to deny marriage to minor girls in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=6&quot;&gt;4:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;وَٱبْتَلُوا۟&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And test the orphans until when they reached the age of marriage (Nikah), then if you perceive in them sound judgement then deliver to them their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Modern Muslim preachers claim that one gets sound judgement about his wealth when one is already an adult person. Thus, this means that Islam prescribed that one can marry only after becoming an adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the word &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Nikah&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah&quot;&gt;Nikah&lt;/a&gt; has a double meaning in the Arabic language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the Islamic Sharia, &quot;Nikah&quot; is a terminology, whose meaning in Islamic Sharia is “marriage”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the literal meaning of “Nikah” in the Arabic language is &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;Nikah (Sexual Consummation of Marriage)&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah_%28Sexual_Consummation_of_Marriage%29&quot;&gt;To do Sexual Intercourse&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes even more evident from another verse of Quran 17:34:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.34?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 17:34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ &lt;b&gt;أَشُدَّهُۥ&lt;/b&gt; ۚ&lt;br&gt;Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of &lt;b&gt;full strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word أَشُدَّهُ (full strength) in this verse means the age when young boys and girls start feeling the desire/strength to do sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as Shar'i Nikah (marriage) is concerned, then there is no condition present in it of reaching the أَشُدَّهُ (i.e. Full Strength to do the act of intercourse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the proof is that prophet Muhammad himself did the Shar'i Nikah with 'Aisha, when she was only 6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And no one tests a 6 years old child for handing over his/her property to him/her, as a 6-year-old child has neither أَشُدَّهُ (Strength/Desire) nor he/she has any kind of “sound judgement” to look after his/her property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Shar'i Nikah has nothing to do with the أَشُدَّهُ (strength), as Muhammad did this Shar'i Nikah with 6 years 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, even at the age of 9, when 'Aisha finally came to the house of Muhammad for the consummation of marriage, she was still not mentally sound enough to look after any property or business. It is evident from the following hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-6130/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 6130:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, according to Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a girl reaches puberty, then she herself gets the right to give her consent for the marriage or to deny the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if she is a minor or prepubescent girl, then her father/guardian could wed her to anyone, even without her consent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if she is prepubescent and also an orphan, then her guardian has the right to wed her with himself (even without her consent), in order to get her property and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5064/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5064:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated 'Urwa: that he asked `Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! &lt;b&gt;(This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr (bride-dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr&lt;/b&gt;, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) &lt;b&gt;to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage&lt;/b&gt;, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reasons that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no longer considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islamqa.com, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet, also refutes these modern Muslim preachers regarding verse 6:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse 4:6 explains that an orphan’s money is given to him/her after they reach puberty and attain sound judgement. What’s meant by sound judgment is sound management of money. This can only happen after puberty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Reaching Nikah” mentioned in the verse means reaching puberty which can be known through sings such as menstruation for females and the growth of pubic hair. The verse used the expression “reaching Nikah” to actually mean “reaching puberty” because in most cases, it’s adults who perform Nikah. But this doesn’t mean that it’s not possible for non-adults to perform Nikah, which is permissible as proven by the Quran, Sunnah and the consensus of scholars. Plus, the same Surah and the same context of verses proves it (the permissibility of child marriage). (The verse that speaks about giving an orphan his money when he/she reaches Nikah is verse no.6) Verse no.3 says: “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. ”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse proves it’s allowed to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of Allah's Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning women..' (4.127) “&lt;a class=&quot;external free&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This shows it’s allowed to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Muslim preachers also come up with this excuse that the word &lt;i&gt;Nisaa'&lt;/i&gt;  refers only to mature, adult women, therefore 65:4 cannot be talking about pre-pubescent females.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-13&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Child_Marriage_in_the_Qur%27an#cite_note-13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This linguistic argument does not hold water, even just on the basis of the Qur'an itself as a text. The word merely means “women/females” and can refer to mixed groups of women of various ages, as the English &quot;female&quot; or &quot;women.&quot; Here are some verses that use the word &lt;i&gt;&quot;nisaa'&quot;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.49?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 2:49&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ ءَالِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوٓءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ ۚ وَفِى ذَٰلِكُم بَلَآءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your (newborn) sons and let your women-folk (i.e. newborn girls) live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 7:127&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ أَتَذَرُ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُۥ لِيُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَءَالِهَتَكَ ۚ قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْىِۦ نِسَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَٰهِرُونَ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Said the chiefs of Pharaoh’s people: “Wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods?” He said: “Their (newborn) male children will we slay; (only) their (newborn) females will we save alive; and we have over them (power) irresistible.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above verses, the word &lt;i&gt;&quot;Nisaa'&quot;&lt;/i&gt; is referring to female infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Quran used the expression “Nisaa’ orphans” to mean “female orphans”. Orphans cannot be adults which means non-adults can be included in the word Nisaa’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;‏ويستفتونك في النساء قل الله يفتيكم فيهن ومايتلى عليكم في الكتاب في يتامى النساء اللاتي لاتؤتونهن ماكتب لهن وترغبون ان تنكحوهن والمستضعفين من الولدان وان تقوموا لليتامى بالقسط وماتفعلوا من خير فان الله كان به عليماThey consult thee concerning women. Say: Allah giveth you decree concerning them, and the Scripture which hath been recited unto you (giveth decree), concerning female orphans and those unto whom ye give not that which is ordained for them though ye desire to marry them, and (concerning) the weak among children, and that ye should deal justly with orphans. Whatever good ye do, lo! Allah is ever Aware of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic Excuse: Shariah didn't stipulate any age for Nikah, so it is a matter of Ijtehaad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Islamic apologist website wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/476539/ruling-on-giving-in-marriage-a-young-girl&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic principle is that there is nothing in Shari‘ah that stipulates a particular age of marriage for the man or the woman. The issue in question, which is related to specifying a particular age for marriage, falls under a general matter, which is: Does the guardian have the right to restrict what is permissible for the public interest? This is one of the matters of ijtihad, so no one should disapprove of it for what his ijtihad has led him to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy on the marriage of young girls reads: &quot;The age of marriage for young girls is determined with the permission of the judge and the matter is left (entrusted) to the ruler in each country according to the circumstances of time, place, and age, in a way that achieves the interest of all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is against Islamic rule that the Halal of Allah cannot be made Haram by any man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Muhammad was not allowed to make Halal of Allah haram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed Muhammad didn't make it to Haram in the incident where a foster father married his adopted daughter for her beauty and wealth. At maximum, Muhammad asked such men in the Quran to do justice and pay full Haq Mahr to their adopted minor daughters, but nothing was made illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why Sahaba were raping minor captive and minor slave girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Islamic history of 14 centuries, no one stipulated sex with minor girls to be Haram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId959348&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Either the Quran supports marriage with minor girls or it's linguistically imperfect and flawed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Just think about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;How can billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years make a mistake about this verse?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Billions of Muslims believe in this Quran from their hearts. They read this Quran and pondered upon it day and night, but still, the modern Islam apologists blame they got misguided despite reading this Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;Didn't the Quran claim that its verses are CLEAR and EASY to understand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;But if the modern Quranists/Islamic Apologists claim that the billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years got misguided despite pondering upon it day and night, then it means that Quran is telling a lie that its verses are clear and EASY to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot;&gt;How can then we believe in such a book which tells lies and make false claims?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at the Quran, which claims that its verses are Clear and Easy to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;easy to understand&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.17&quot;&gt;54:17&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;manifest&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2&quot;&gt;27:1-2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/12.2&quot;&gt;12:2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However according to modern Muslim apologists and the Quranists, then this Quran was neither a guide nor mercy for billions of Muslims of the last 1400 years, as minor girls were being wed and being used for sexual pleasures. And millions of minor slave girls were also bought from the slave markets, and used for sexual pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is then responsible for the plight of these minor girls?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Were really Muslims of the last 1400 years responsible, who were reading this Quran and pondering upon it, and despite that came to absolutely wrong and horrible conclusions? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Or it was the so-called Allah, who was UNABLE to reveal a single clear verse about the rights of minor girls? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id=&quot;mozToc&quot;&gt;&lt;!--mozToc h1 1 h2 2 h3 3 h4 4 h5 5 h6 6--&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Why Didn't Allah &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(224, 62, 45); text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;EXPLICITLY&lt;/span&gt; Ban Child Marriage in the Quran?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah possessed knowledge of the unseen future and foresaw the disagreements among Islamic scholars (with 99% ultimately allowing child marriage), why didn’t He reveal an explicit prohibition in the Quran to prevent the suffering of millions of underage Muslim girls over the past 14 centuries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries, billions of Muslims have believed that Islam permits the marriage of minor girls, citing Quranic verse 65:4 and numerous traditions (Ahadith) as justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a small minority of Muslims—less than 1%—reject this interpretation. They dispute the authenticity of Ahadith regarding ‘Aisha’s age at marriage and argue against traditional readings of verse 65:4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;central question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; remains: if Allah knew that countless innocent girls would suffer due to these false Ahadith and misinterpretations, why didn’t He include a &lt;strong&gt;clear, explicit verse&lt;/strong&gt; in the Quran banning the marriage of underage girls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a &lt;strong&gt;single unambiguous verse&lt;/strong&gt; would have resolved this issue and spared millions from harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran, a lengthy book, is filled with verses extolling Allah's power, recounting ancient stories, and threatening non-Muslims with eternal hellfire. However, on crucial human issues like this, it remains strikingly silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, millions of underage girls have suffered through the centuries, while Allah seemingly &quot;forgot&quot; to include a single verse addressing this pressing matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the Quran claims that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;easy to understand&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.17&quot;&gt;54:17&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;manifest&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2&quot;&gt;27:1-2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/12.2&quot;&gt;12:2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a Book whose verses are perfectly explained—a Quran in Arabic for people who know (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/41.3&quot;&gt;41:3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;Why did those billions of Muslims of the first 14 centuries still get misguided?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;They firmly believed in this Quran from the depths of their hearts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;They read it day and night&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f02ff;&quot;&gt;They pondered upon it their entire lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Yet, they still arrived at interpretations that many modern Muslims now argue are misguided. If these billions of devoted followers, with their sincere efforts, failed to grasp the Quran's intended meaning, the problem does not lie with them—it lies with the Quran itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a deeper, more fundamental question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the Quran truly authored by an all-knowing deity, or does its ambiguity and silence on crucial issues reflect human limitations in its origins?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran's inability to prevent such widespread misguidance undermines its claim of being a flawless and divine revelation. It suggests that its clarity and comprehensibility are far from perfect, raising doubts about its divine authorship (i.e. No Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelations on his own. Since he was only a human, thus we see these flaws in the Quran, where it is neither clear and easy to understand, nor able to guide billions of Muslims). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId429685&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;List of authentic Hadiths that say 'Aisha was 9 at consummation and 4 of them say 18 when Muhammed died&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of 17 authentic Ahadith, which tell that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha was married at the age of 6,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the marriage was consummated when she was 9 years old. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And 4 of these Ahadith also tell that 'Aisha was 18 years old when Muhammad died. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, few of them are narrated by other people than Hisham (i.e. people who deny 'Aisha's age of 9 years at the time of consummation, they falsely claim that all such Ahadith are narrated by Hisham only). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There are traditions which don't mention the age of 'Aisha directly at the time of marriage, but they tell us that 'Aisha used to play with dolls after the marriage. This also proves that 'Aisha was still a child of 9 years old when she came into the house of Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-8/Book-73/Hadith-151/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6130&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;highlightable&quot;&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;hadith&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith__text arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;highlightable&quot;&gt;وَحَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ بْنُ حُمَيْدٍ، أَخْبَرَنَا عَبْدُ الرَّزَّاقِ، أَخْبَرَنَا مَعْمَرٌ، عَنِ الزُّهْرِيِّ، عَنْ عُرْوَةَ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَزَوَّجَهَا وَهْىَ بِنْتُ سَبْعِ سِنِينَ وَزُفَّتْ إِلَيْهِ وَهِيَ بِنْتُ تِسْعِ سِنِينَ وَلُعَبُهَا مَعَهَا وَمَاتَ عَنْهَا وَهِيَ بِنْتُ ثَمَانَ عَشْرَةَ ‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith__references&quot;&gt;'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modern Islamic apologists absolutely don't answer how can a 19-year-old girl play with dolls. So, their tactic is to totally neglect this proof. Nevertheless, this tactic does not work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId97711&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islam allows men to take sexual pleasure even from breastfed baby-girls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next problem is that marriage with non-adult girls is not limited only to 'Aisha, but it is a GENERAL Ruling that it is Halal (permissible) for a father to wed her non-adult daughter (even a baby girl) with any man of his own choice, without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other non-adult girls (except for 'Aisha) didn't have to absorb any knowledge to give it further (like in the case of 'Aisha as Islamic apologists claim). So, why did then Islam oppress them in this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islam allows men to marry minor girls and undress them, kiss their naked bodies, and rub their penises in their thighs to ejaculate, and take all other kinds of sexual pleasures from them (except penetration into their vaginas)&lt;/strong&gt;, even though those minor girls don't need to absorb any knowledge like 'Aisha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic website &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/islamweb.net&quot;&gt;islamweb.net&lt;/a&gt; gave this fatwa(&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160129102417/http://fatwa.islamweb.net/fatwa/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;amp;lang=A&amp;amp;Id=78529&amp;amp;Option=FatwaId&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;الاستمتاع بالزوجة الصغيرة.. رؤية شرعية ۔۔۔&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Taking sexual pleasure from minor girl according to Sharia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فإنه لا حرجَ في تقبيلِ الزوجة الصغيرة بشهوة والمفاخذة ونحوَ ذلك ولو كانت لا تطيقُ الجماع وقد بيَّنَ العلماء أن الأصلَ جوازُ استمتاع الرجل بزوجته كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر وذكروا في ذلك استمناءَه بيدها ومداعبَتها وتقبيلَها وغير ذلك&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no problem to kiss the minor girl wife with intention of sexual pleasure and to do &quot;مفاخذہ&quot; which is to rub the penis between her thighs in order to ejaculate the sperms, or to do any other similar act&lt;/strong&gt;. All these acts of sexual pleasure are permitted, even if she does not possess the power for penetration. According to Ulama, a husband is free to enjoy her in every way till the time no harm is done to her. So, the minor girl could masturbate him, foreplay could be done with her, she could be kissed and similar other things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Fatwas about &lt;strong&gt;&quot;مفاخذہ&quot; (i.e. thighing)&lt;/strong&gt; are present &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Thighing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of the largest Websites for Muslims is Islamonline.net, which says a similar thing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20100125211912/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-Arabic-Ask_Scholar/FatwaA/FatwaA&amp;amp;cid=1122528623306&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فإنه لا ضررَ في الإنزالِ بين فخذي الصغيرة التي لا تطيقُ الجماع وتتضررُ به إذا كان ذلك الإنزالُ بدونِ إيلاج، وقد بَيَّنَ العلماءُ أن الأصلَ هو جوازُ استمتاعِ الرجلِ بزوجتِه كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no problem if husband rubs his penis between the thighs of minor girl in order to ejaculate the sperm, even the minor girl does not possess the ability for penetration... According to the Islamic Scholars husband is allowed to enjoy the minor wife in every possible way till the time she is not harmed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islam allowed men to buy small baby slave girls from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, and then take all kinds of sexual pleasures from those slave babies and minor slave girls. It happened due to another evil of Islamic slavery, where Islam allowed the owners to take away the babies from their slave mothers when they got their first 2 molar teeth in pairs (i.e. when they were about 6 months old), and then to sell them in the slave markets. Read the details here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity&quot;&gt;Sharia of Islam: A slave mother and her baby can be separated and sold (in the Bazaars of slavery) after the baby has his two molar teeth (i.e. about 6 to 8 months)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are authentic reports where companions of Muhammad not only used to rape the captive women, but they also used to rape the captive small prepubescent girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Istibra &lt;/em&gt;is a period of sexual abstinence required till the first period of the captive girl is over. This is to ensure no confusion on paternity. Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.&lt;br&gt;As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read more details in this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=71&amp;amp;catid=32&quot;&gt;Islam: Even a breastfed baby Girl can be married and used for sexual pleasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith__text arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId31951&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islam's Usurpation of a Small Girl's Right to Love through Forced Marriage without Consent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam permits the father or guardian to forcibly arrange a minor girl's Nikah with any man, regardless of his age, even if he is fifty years old. The father or guardian is not required to seek the minor girl's consent (and even if he asks, she is not in a position to give her consent due to her age).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, Abu Bakr arranged a 6-year-old Aisha's marriage to a 50-year-old individual like Muhammad without even consulting Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises a critical question: What opportunities does such a minor girl have to mature and experience natural love with someone of her own age group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is disheartening: she has absolutely no chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly astonishing that despite depriving small girls of the right to experience natural love, Islamists still claim Islam to be a religion of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId868182&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Extreme Dangers for teen mothers and their babies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at what modern science is telling you about the risks of death and injuries to small girls and their babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;1. Science says 25-30 is the age of least risk to mother and child for a first pregnancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;With the onset of puberty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory essentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology around the age of 25–30 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2.. The younger the mother, the greater the risk. Childbearing in adolescents aged 12–15 years in low resource countries: a neglected issue. New estimates from demographic and household surveys in 42 countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;It is frequently cited that girls who give birth aged 15–19 are more than twice as likely to die as those in their 20s (1, 2). However, this fails to capture the fact that risk increases with decreasing age. ......girls aged 15 or under had an odds ratio for maternal death four times higher than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;3. It is not just mortality, it's fistulas. Science says it is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;4. Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Many women and girls who manage to survive childbirth in these conditions may suffer from fistulas—holes that develop between the vaginal wall and the rectum or bladder. When a baby's head becomes lodged during birth, it can damage the mother's soft tissue between its skull and her pelvic bones, causing portions of the tissue to die and creating a hole. Consequently, faeces and urine leak through the opening and out of the vagina. Such a condition leads to societal rejection and divorce for affected women, and young girls face an even greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId692108&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Even if they survive, still the Children of teen mothers suffer dreadful health problems their entire life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The high mortality rate among children born to teen mothers is not the only issue; these children also endure other dreadful health problems throughout their entire lives&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children of teen mothers are at higher risk of intellectual, language, and socio-emotional delays.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Day_2009_30-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Day_2009-30&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Sentence (law)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_%28law%29&quot;&gt;serve time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title=&quot;Prison&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-37&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-37&quot;&gt;[37]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is all this Data Islamophobic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId232338&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Two types of Islamic apologists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of Islamic apologists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first type of Islamic apologists accept that 'Aisha was indeed 6 years old when she was married. But they present other excuses to defend and justify it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second type of Islamic apologists who altogether deny that 'Aisah was 6 years old at the time of marriage. They try to prove that 'Aisha was 18 years old at the time of marriage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss and analyze all arguments by both of these two groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId150089&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 1st type of Islamic Apologists, who accept that 'Aisha was 6 years old, but present OTHER EXCUSES to justify it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId213625&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1st Excuse: Muhammad married 6 years old 'Aisha's while she had Ability to Acquire Knowledge at a Young Age&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers assert that Muhammad married young 'Aisha because she possessed the remarkable ability to absorb a vast amount of knowledge due to her tender age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquiring knowledge is not solely dependent on one's age but rather on their intelligence and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Hurayrah embraced Islam at the age of 26 and spent only three years with Muhammad. Yet, he absorbed a much larger amount of knowledge from Muhammad, narrating 5,374 hadiths, whereas 'Aisha, despite her younger age, narrated only 2,210 hadiths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad also had wives like Saffiyah and others who were between 15 to 20 years of age. An intelligent 16-year-old woman is likely to better comprehend complex issues, absorb knowledge, and preserve it compared to 'Aisha, who, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130&quot;&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari, 6130&lt;/a&gt;, used to play with dolls at the age of 9 years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 6130&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls &lt;strong&gt;in the presence of the Prophet (i.e. after the marriage was consummated at the age of 9 years)&lt;/strong&gt;, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId550566&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2nd Excuse: Muhammad married 6 years old  'Aisha so that she could Educate Others about Islam after Muhammad's Death&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers often use the argument that Muhammad married young 'Aisha so that she could live long after his death to disseminate his teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that Muhammad also had wives like Saffiyah and others who were between 15 to 20 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there truly exists an Allah, then he could have extended the life of any of Muhammad's wives. For example, a 16-year-old wife of Muhammad could also have lived long enough to spread his knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Aisha passed away at the age of 65 years. So, wouldn't it have been equally possible for Allah to prolong the life of any other adult wife of Muhammad to 70 or 80 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId768299&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3rd Excuse: 'Aisha's was SATISFIED with the Marriage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers assert that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha had no problem with being married at 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha’s father, family, and tribe had no problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the arch-enemies of the Prophet (who were always looking to attack him) had no problem!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But only the &quot;illiterates&quot; of the 21st century say: We have a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, at times, oppression reaches such extremes that individuals forget about their fundamental human rights and begin to perceive the oppression as acceptable. A similar phenomenon was witnessed when Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery. Some slaves, despite gaining freedom, returned to their former owners due to the deep brainwashing they had endured. They had been convinced that being slaves and deprived of basic human rights was their rightful place. However, these wicked customs and societal practices remain unjust, even if they succeed in manipulating oppressed individuals into believing their fate is tied to these evils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if the arch-enemies of Muhammad didn't criticize him for any crime while they also practised it, then it does not make Muhammad free of blame. For example, if Muhammad had also started killing the newborn baby girls and his arch-enemies would have not criticized him for that (while they also did the same, as Muslims claim), did it make Muhammad free of blame too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the 2 dominant neighbouring empires had already prohibited intercourse with 9-year-old girls before Muhammad (you will see the proof later in this article). In Roman Egypt, Basra etc. a man could get severe punishments for seducing a girl under 13 because she was considered too young to give consent and not capable of fully understanding the risks to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, you claim that Muhammad had the best &lt;strong&gt;Morals&lt;/strong&gt;. So how come this man with eternally perfect morals couldn’t see that marrying a 6-year-old was morally wrong? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you claim that Muhammad's morals were perfect for eternity, and his Sunnah (practices) should be followed in all eras, then you are automatically making marriage to a 6-year-old baby girl Halal (i.e. permissible) &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt; too. We can just hope that Muslims can understand the &lt;strong&gt;dangers&lt;/strong&gt; of the claim of these so-called eternal Morals of the Prophet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId306409&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4th Excuse: Intercourse with 9 years old girls was a norm in the era of Muhammad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam preachers also come up with an excuse that it was tradition of that era that minor girls were also married without their consent, so we should not question this Islamic Ruling today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, this erroneous Islamic ruling is subject to scrutiny for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, even if we were to assume that it was a prevalent practice during that era, the question arises as to why Allah/Muhammad did not abolish and prohibit this wrong practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, Muhammad did not even verbally condemn this practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contrast, he encouraged it by establishing it as a Sunnah through his marriage to 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the claims made by Islamic preachers that this practice was common during that time are not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) The Jews at the time had already set the marriage age to 12:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D'Rabbi_Natan?tab=contents%20%22Composed:%20Talmudic%20Israel/Babylon,%20c.650%20-%20c.950%20CE%20Avot%20d%E2%80%99Rabbi%20Natan&quot;&gt;Pious and Rebellious,Grossman, Avraham;,Brandeis University Press&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Intense opposition to the marriage of young girls is brought in the name of R. Shimon bar Yohai, that “Whoever marries off his daughter when she is young minimizes the bearing of children and loses his money and comes to bloodshed.”5 5. Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, Version II, ch. 48, p. 66. The concern is that the young girl may become pregnant and die as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) Romans:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500 years before Muhammed, doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soranus_of_Ephesus&quot;&gt;Soranus&lt;/a&gt; wrote his book about gynaecology and in hit he stated that women could be considered fit for conception from 15. 15 is significantly older than 9. Soranus was from Ephesos and worked in Alexandria before he moved to Rome. So he had met desert-conditions girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soranus wrote in his book: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/book/2189958/9b5cce/soranus-gynecology.html&quot;&gt;Soranus, Of Ephesus and Owsei Temkin (1994) &lt;em&gt;Soranus’ gynecology&lt;/em&gt;. Baltimore Johns Hopkins Univ. Press.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 233):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book about gynecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &quot;For it obtains whenever women married before maturity conceive and give birth while the uterus has not yet fully grown nor the fundus of (the) uterus expanded.&quot; So they knew the pelvic floor and birth canal were not mature enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 227)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... difficult labor occur in those who give birth in a way which is contrary to nature? Diocles the Caerystan in the second book on gynecology says that primiparae and young women have difficult labor&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Recognize Those Capable of Conception:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since women usually are married for the sake of children and succession and not for mere enjoyment and since it is utterly absurd to make inquiries about the excellence of their lineage and the abundance of their means but to leave unexamined whether they can conceive or not and whether they are fit for childbearing or not it is only right for us to give an account of the matter in question One must judge the majority from the ages of 15 to 40 to be fit for conception&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here was the law in the Roman Empire before Muhammad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/146/abstract/roman-law-and-marriage-underage-girls&quot;&gt;Roman Law and the Marriage of Underage Girls&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;Twelve will seem to us undesirably young, and indeed ancient doctors such as Soranus warned against the dangers of women becoming sexually active at so early an age. Most Roman women appear to have married later, from about 15 to 20. But the possibility of efarlier marriage we know to have been actively pursued especially in upper-class families, where marriage often assisted dynastic alliances.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Sparta:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In fact, Sparta raised the marriage age from 18 to 20 with the primary aim of decreasing the number of sickly children. As a result, they observed an increase in life expectancy for women, which began to rival that of men. It became evident that child marriage was the main contributing factor to mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While Athenian women might have expected to marry for the first time around the &lt;strong&gt;age of fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; to men much older than them, Spartan women normally married between the ages of eighteen and twenty to men close to them in age.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-FOOTNOTECartledge198194–95_29-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTECartledge198194%E2%80%9395-29&quot;&gt;[29]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Spartan ideology, the primary role of adult women was to bear and raise healthy children. This focus on childbearing was likely responsible for the emphasis on physical fitness in Spartan women, as it was believed that physically stronger women would have healthier children.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlundell1995157-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bearing and raising children was considered the most important role for women in Spartan society; equal to male warriors in the Spartan army.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-50&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-50&quot;&gt;[50]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Spartan women were encouraged to produce many children, preferably male, to increase Sparta's military population. They took pride in having borne and raised brave warriors.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-51&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-51&quot;&gt;[51]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hence, even with an emphasis on bearing numerous children, Sparta raised the age of marriage for women to 18–20 years. Interestingly, this decision did not hinder Spartan women from having many children. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in the mortality rate among both mothers and children. Additionally, this measure curbed the birth of weak offspring prone to diseases. As a result, only healthy and robust children were born, growing up to become outstanding warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId452798&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5th Excuse: The SHORTER life span in that era was the reason for early marriages of 9-year-old girls&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Muslim Apologists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://muslimskeptic.com/author/drjou/&quot;&gt;Daniel Haquiqajou&lt;/a&gt; come up with excuses like (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Video link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vast majority of history, life expectancy was relatively low. Moreover, infant mortality was considerably high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, it was then necessary to use the extent of the 'fertility window' for reproduction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is why Islam didn't prohibit this practice, but the prophet Muhammad himself married a 9-year-old 'Aisha. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Many societies did not breed 9 or 10-year-old prepubescent girls and did just fine. In fact, Sparta raised the marriage age from 18 to 20 with the primary aim of decreasing the number of sickly children. As a result, they observed an increase in life expectancy for women, which began to rival that of men. It became evident that child marriage was the main contributing factor to mortality rates. Hence, even with an emphasis on bearing numerous children, Sparta raised the age of marriage for women to 18–20 years. Interestingly, this decision did not hinder Spartan women from having many children. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in the mortality rate among both mothers and children. Additionally, this measure curbed the birth of weak offspring prone to diseases. As a result, only healthy and robust children were born, growing up to become outstanding warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId714389&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Earlier_puberty_and_menarchy_in_the_past&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;6th Excuse: Girls got Puberty Earlier in the past&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of menarche (i.e. the first menstrual period in a female adolescent) today is about 11 to 12 years among girls. But Islamic apologists claim that puberty occurred earlier in the past, and thus it was ok for Muhammad to have sex with 9 years old 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, please note that 'Aisha didn't get menarche when Muhammad had intercourse with her at the age of 9 years, but she was still prepubescent. There is absolutely no proof that she got her menses at the age of 9, but modern-day Muslims have fabricated this claim on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-8/Book-73/Hadith-151/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6130&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;highlightable&quot;&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, &lt;strong&gt;not yet reached the age of puberty&lt;/strong&gt;.) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran (verse 65:4) allows men to have intercourse with prepubescent girls who have not reached puberty yet (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/marriage-rape-of-minor-girls/71-islam-even-a-breastfed-baby-girl-could-be-married-and-used-for-sexual-pleasure#mozTocId151488&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, menarche does not mean that a girl has become able to have sex mentally and physically and have a child. There are girls who today get menarche at the age of 8 years or 7 years or 6 years or even at the age of 5 years. Does it mean it is ok to do sex with a 5 years old girl? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId814603&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;7th Excuse: Nature is on Islam's side while puberty is an indication one has to start a sex life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous Islamic apologist Daniel Haqiqatjou came up with this excuse in his video (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G5Qarvt9Tk&amp;amp;t=2878s&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). He further claims that not having sex at puberty causes children to indulge in masturbation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this claim is unfounded for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary issue lies in Muslims' belief that their Allah is 100% perfect and that Allah has created a 100% perfect nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, nature is not flawlessly tailored for humans or any other species. Nature follows its course, and as humans, we must adapt ourselves to its demands; otherwise, we face the risk of extinction. The same holds true for all other species as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While animals may be biologically ready for sexual activity at the onset of puberty, humans are different in this regard. There is a significant distinction between animals and humans in terms of their development and behavior, as humans undergo complex psychological, emotional, and social changes during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animals don't need the &quot;consent&quot; of a weaker partner, but they go for forced sex. But humans have the ability of thinking, and we have human rights, and giving &quot;consent&quot; is one of our fundamental rights. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But Islam turns humans again into animals again. It took away the right of minor girls to give their consent, but their fathers can force them into sex with any man of their choice (even if he is an old man).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even puberty at the age of 9-12 is not enough to become &lt;strong&gt;mentally&lt;/strong&gt; sound enough to choose a suitable partner. Mental maturity is totally different from physical maturity, and one becomes mentally mature at the age of 16 to 18 years. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And animals may be &quot;naturally&quot; able to have sex and to have babies as soon as they become adults. But this is not the case with humans. We have provided all proof above of how girls at 12 (when they get puberty) are still at huge risk of different diseases including Fistula and death at the time of delivery. Similarly, how their babies are at extremely higher risk of dying during delivery or of suffering many diseases even after birth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, does the fear of indulging in masturbation is a good enough excuse to indulge in the dangerous (and in some cases, life-threatening) practice of sex with grown-up men and pregnancy and delivery of babies? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Muslim men were never satisfied with their one (or even four wives). They were constantly raping slave girls, and then selling them and then buying new slave girls for them. They were also swapping their slave girls among themselves. They were also taking the slave wives of their male slaves, raping them, and then returning them to their male slaves after fulfilling their lust. Please read this article for details and proof: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Part 1: Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId975181&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 2nd type of Islamic apologists, who altogether deny that 'Aisah was 6 years old at the time of marriage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us see and analyze their objections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId125063&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1st Objection: All these traditions are narrated by only one person i.e. Hisham bin 'Urwa and none from Medina narrated it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But this objection is false. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The traditions about 'Aisha's age at the time of marriage have been narrated by multiple alternative chains of narrations, including the people of Medina too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Sheikh Haddad is a Sunni Hadith Master, and he replied to this objection as following (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Al-Zuhri also reports it from `&lt;strong&gt;Urwa &lt;/strong&gt;(i.e. Hisham's father directly), from `A'isha; so does &lt;strong&gt;`Abd Allah ibn Dhakwan&lt;/strong&gt;, both major Madanis. So is the &lt;strong&gt;Tabi`i Yahya al-Lakhmi&lt;/strong&gt; who reports it from her in the Musnad and in Ibn Sa`d's Tabaqat. So is Abu Ishaq Sa`d ibn Ibrahim who reports it from &lt;strong&gt;Imam al-Qasim ibn Muhammad&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the Seven Imams of Madina, from `A'isha. All the narratives of this event have been reported. In addition to the above four Madinese Tabi`in narrators, Sufyan ibn `Uyayna from Khurasan and `Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya from Tabarayya in Palestine both report it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId772324&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2nd Objection: Revelation time of surah al-Qamar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-6/Book-60/Hadith-399/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;),  'Aisha explains she was a &quot;playful girl&quot; (jariyatun al-'abu لَجَارِيَةٌ أَلْعَبُ) when Surah (chapter) al-Qamar of the Quran was revealed. This group of modern Islam apologists claim that Surah al-Qamar was revealed 9 years before Hijrah, which makes 'Aisha to be much older than 6 years at the time of marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are wrong as there is no proof present that Surah al-Qamar was revealed 9 years before Hijrah. Sheikh Haddad refutes them by stating (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hadith Masters, Sira historians, and Qur'anic commentators agree that the splitting of the moon took place about five years before the Holy Prophet's (upon him blessings and peace) Hijra to Madina. Thus it is confirmed that our Mother `Aisha was born between seven and eight years before the Hijra and the words that she was a jariya or little girl five years before the Hijra match the fact that her age at the time Surat al-Qamar was revealed was around 2 or 3. A two year old is not an infant. A two year old is able to run around, which is what jariya means. As for &quot;the comments of the experts&quot; they concur on 6 or 7 as the age of marriage and 9 as the age of cohabitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId140333&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3rd Objection: &lt;span id=&quot;Battle_of_Badr_and_Uhud&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Battle of Badr and Uhud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This apologetic argument aims to make the claim that Aisha was at the Battles of Badr and Uhud, and that since standard practice at the time disallowed anyone under 15 from joining the battlefield, she could not have been younger than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaykh Haddad responds to this apologetic argument (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the prohibition applied to combatants. It applied neither to non-combatant boys nor to non-combatant girls and women. Second, `A'isha did not participate in Badr at all but bade farewell to the combatants as they were leaving Madina, as narrated by Muslim in his Sahih. On the day of Uhud (year 3), Anas, at the time only twelve or thirteen years old, reports seeing an eleven-year old `A'isha and his mother Umm Sulaym having tied up their dresses and carrying water skins back and forth to the combatants, as narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId643739&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4th Objection: &lt;span id=&quot;Age_of_Asma&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Age of Asma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a title=&quot;Sahih&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Sahih#Da.27if&quot;&gt;da'if&lt;/a&gt; (weak) hadith narrated from al-Zinad and recorded in the works of some medieval scholars, including al-Dhahabi (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/124483/how-old-was-aishah-when-she-married-the-prophet&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), states that Aisha's older sister Asma was ten years older than her. This has been combined with improbable information about Asma being 100 years old at the time of her death in 73 AH to calculate that Aisha was eighteen or nineteen at the time of her marriage consummation (1 AH or 2 AH - (73 - 100) - 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;Shaykh Haddad (link)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/124483/how-old-was-aishah-when-she-married-the-prophet&quot;&gt;IslamQA (link)&lt;/a&gt; website both independently criticise this approach as relying on a single narrator, who most scholars regard as weak, and note that a hadith by a more reliable chain from the same narrator gives a broader range for the age difference between the sisters. Both also note that al-Dhahabi too gave the vaguer opinion that Asma was &quot;ten or more&quot; years older than Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId562874&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Tabari's_account_of_Abu_Bakr's_children_and_wives&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Tabari.27s_account_of_Abu_Bakr.27s_children_and_wives&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;5th Objection: Tabari's account of Abu Bakr's children and wives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologists claim that &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Tabari&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Tabari&quot;&gt;al-Tabari's&lt;/a&gt; recorded that Aisha was born in the pre-islamic period, and thus could not have been less than 14 tears old (Reference: Al-Tabari, Vol. 4, Pg. 50, Arabic, Dar al-fikr, Beirut, 1979)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, al-Tabari's own account reports at least five times that Aisha was around 6-7 years old during marriage and the marriage was consummated 3 years later (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha%27s_Age#Tabari.27s_account_of_Abu_Bakr.27s_children_and_wives&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Shaykh Gibril Haddad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) says that the initial passage mentioned is misinterpreted, stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Al-Tabari nowhere reports that 'Abu Bakr's four children were all born in Jahiliyya' but only that Abu Bakr married both their mothers in Jahiliyya, Qutayla bint Sa`d and Umm Ruman, who bore him four children in all, two each, `A'isha being the daughter of Umm Ruman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId444946&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Time_of_Umar's_conversion_to_Islam&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Time_of_Umar.27s_conversion_to_Islam&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;6th Objection: Time of Umar's conversion to Islam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument draws on &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sira&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Sira&quot;&gt;al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah&lt;/a&gt; (Biography of the Prophet) to claim that since Ayesha converted to Islam before Umar she could not have been born during the first year of Islam (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha%27s_Age#Time_of_Umar.27s_conversion_to_Islam&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even if the claim Aisha converted to Islam before Umar was true, it does not mean this took place during the first year of Islam, since Umar converted in 617 AD, about 4 years after Aisha’s birth in 613 AD (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha%27s_Age#cite_note-Siddiqui-1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, Aisha never remembered a time before when her family wasn't Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-5/Book-58/Hadith-245/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides disputing the claim that Ibn Hisham reported that Aisha accepted Islam quite sometime before `Umar ibn al-Khattab, Shaykh Haddad also casts doubt on the claim stating (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere does Ibn Hisham say this. Rather, Ibn Hisham lists `A'isha among 'those that accepted Islam because of Abu Bakr.' This does not mean that she embraced Islam during the first year of Islam. Nor does it mean that she necessarily embraced Islam before `Umar (year 6) although she was born the previous year (year 7 before the Hijra) although it is understood she will automatically follow her father's choice even before the age of reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId128737&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Tabari's_account_of_Abu_Bakr's_migration_to_Habshah&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Tabari.27s_account_of_Abu_Bakr.27s_migration_to_Habshah&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;7th Objection: Tabari's account of Abu Bakr's migration to Habshah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument claims that al-Tabari states that when Abu Bakr was planning to migrate to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), he spoke to Mut`am, with whose son, Jabayr, Aisha was engaged. This migration occurred eight years before hijrah, at which time Aisha had only just been born if she consummated her marriage to Muhammad at the age of 9 or 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of this claim admit they have no primary source, which originated in Kandhalvi's Urdu booklet (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamawareness.net/FAQ/what_was_ayesha.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Shayk Haddad responds that &quot;there is no mention of emigration in Tabari's account of Abu Bakr's discussion with Mut`im&quot; and &quot;there had been only some preliminary talk, not a formal arrangement&quot;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Haddad_45-8&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha%27s_Age#cite_note-Haddad-45&quot;&gt;[45]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId687997&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_meaning_of_bikr&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;8th Objection: The meaning of &lt;em&gt;bikr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument cites a hadith in Ibn Hanbal's Musnad saying that Khaulah suggested Aisha to Muhammad as a virgin (bikr) he could marry. The claim is that bikr would not be used for a young girl (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamawareness.net/FAQ/what_was_ayesha.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are multiple sahih hadith narrations of a highly relevant conversation between Muhammad and Jabir in which bikr (virgin) is clearly compatible with jariyah (young girl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated Jabir: &quot;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, &quot;Have you got married O Jabir?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He asked &quot;What, a virgin [bikr] or a matron [thayyib]?&quot; I replied, &quot;Not a virgin but a matron.&quot; He said, &quot;Why did you not marry a young girl [jariyah] who would have fondled with you?
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes_ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-5/Book-59/Hadith-382/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5:59:382&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaykh Haddad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) says regarding the claim, &quot;This is ignorant nonsense, bikr means a virgin girl, a girl who has never been married even if her age is 0 and there is no unclarity here whatsoever.&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId656180&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Fatima's_age_difference&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Fatima.27s_age_difference&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;9th Objection: Fatima's age difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This claim is that according to ibn Hajar, Fatima was five years older than Aisha and Muhammad was 35 years old when Fatima was born. Therefore, based on this claim, Aisha must have been a teenager at the time her marriage was consummated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the proponent of this claim (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamawareness.net/FAQ/what_was_ayesha.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) has combined and selectively quoted conflicting sources. Shaykh Haddad responds (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar mentions two versions: (1) al-Waqidi's narration that Fatima was born when the Prophet was 35; and (2) Ibn `Abd al-Barr's narration that she was born when he was 41, approximately one year more or less before Prophethood, and about five years before `A'isha was born. The latter version matches the established dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId448784&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Hadith_saying_Aisha_had_reached_puberty&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;10th Objection: Hadith said Aisha had reached puberty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is based on a mistranslated hadith, Sahih Bukhari 1:8:465, which in one English translation states that Aisha had seen her parents follow Islam since the age of puberty, and not a day passed by without Muhammad visiting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the age of puberty. Not a day passed but the Prophet (ﷺ) visited us, both in the mornings and evenings[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-1/Book-8/Hadith-465/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 1:8:465&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the word أَعْقِلْ means thoughts or reasoning, but the translator, Muhsin Khan, has used the word 'puberty'. The meaning rather is simply that 'Aisha was aware that her parents were following Islam. A literal translation would be &quot;I was not aware of my parents other than that the two of them both acknowledged the religion&quot;. The exact same Arabic phrase is translated correctly by the same translator in another narration of the same hadith (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-3/Book-37/Hadith-494/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId978256&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Hadith_in_which_Aisha_mensturated&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;11th Objection: Hadith in which Aisha menstruated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is also based on a mistranslated hadith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud 4915 (Ahmad Hasan numbering; 4933 Dar-us-Salam):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) married me when I was seven or six. When we came to Medina, some women came. according to Bishr's version: Umm Ruman came to me when I was swinging. They took me, made me prepared and decorated me. I was then brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he took up cohabitation with me when I was nine. She halted me at the door, and I burst into laughter. Abu Dawud said: That is to say: I menstruated, and I was brought in a house, and there were some women of the Ansari in it. They said: With good luck and blessing. The tradition of one of them has been included in the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes_ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/AbuDawud/Hasan/Hadith-4915/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud 4915 (Ahmad Hasan Ref)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad Hasan mistranslates Abu Dawud's comment as &quot;That is to say: I menstruated&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aisha's phrase &quot;I burst into laughter&quot; is fa-qultu heeh heeh (فَقُلْتُ هِيهْ هِيهْ), &quot;And I said heh, heh&quot;. The Dar-us-Salam English-Arabic edition of Sunan Abu Dawud translated by Nasiruddin al-Khattab (Hadith 4933) renders Aisha's words here: &quot;She made me stand at the door &lt;strong&gt;and I started to breathe deeply&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; (Dar-us-Salam does not include Abu Dawud's comment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dawud's comment is &quot;ay tanaffasat (أَىْ تَنَفَّسَتْ)&quot;, which is &quot;That is to say 'I breathed'&quot;. The verb nun-fa-sin is used here in Arabic form V with the ta prefix and shadda (doubled) middle letter, which Lane's Lexicon says means &quot;breathed&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId686475&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Aisha_remembered_the_migration_setting_out_to_Abyssinia&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;12th Objection: Aisha remembered the migration setting out to Abyssinia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hadith has been commonly misinterpreted in order to claim that Aisha remembered Muhammad coming to Abu Bakr when it was time to migrate to Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia). This forced migration occurred due to what Urwa b. al-Zubayr in his first letter describes as the first persecution (&lt;em&gt;al-fitnah al-ūlā&lt;/em&gt;) in Mecca, before the migration some years later to Medina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hadith itself does not state which migration it relates too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Aisha: Rarely did the Prophet (ﷺ) fail to visit Abu Bakr's house everyday, either in the morning or in the evening. When the permission for migration to Medina was granted, all of a sudden the Prophet (ﷺ) came to us at noon and Abu Bakr was informed, who said, &quot;Certainly the Prophet (ﷺ) has come for some urgent matter.&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Abu Bakr, when the latter entered &quot;Let nobody stay in your home.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! There are only my two daughters (namely `Aisha and Asma') present.&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;I feel (am informed) that I have been granted the permission for migration.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;I will accompany you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;You will accompany me.&quot; Abu Bakr then said &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have two she-camels I have prepared specially for migration, so I offer you one of them. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;I have accepted it on the condition that I will pay its price.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-3/Book-34/Hadith-348/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 3:34:348&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hadith shows clearly that the above hadith actually refers to the migration to Medina, not Abyssinia. Notice the similar phrasing about Muhammad coming to Abu Bakr at noon after being granted permission to migrate. At the end of the quote, &lt;strong&gt;Medina&lt;/strong&gt; is mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: Abu Bakr asked the Prophet (ﷺ) to allow him to go out (of Mecca) when he was greatly annoyed (by the infidels). But the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, &quot;Wait.&quot; Abu Bakr said, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Do you hope that you will be allowed (to migrate)?&quot; Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, &quot;I hope so.&quot; So Abu Bakr waited for him till one day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came at noon time and addressed him saying &quot;Let whoever is present with you, now leave you.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;None is present but my two daughters.&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;Have you noticed that I have been allowed to go out (to migrate)?&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle, I would like to accompany you.&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;You will accompany me.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have got two she-camels which I had prepared and kept ready for (our) going out.&quot; So he gave one of the two (she-camels) to the Prophet (ﷺ) and it was Al-Jad`a. They both rode and proceeded till they reached the Cave at the mountain of Thaur where they hid themselves. Amir bin Fuhaira was the slave of `Abdullah bin at-Tufail bin Sakhbara `Aisha's brother from her mother's side. Abu Bakr had a milch she-camel. Amir used to go with it (i.e. the milch she-camel) in the afternoon and come back to them before noon by setting out towards them in the early morning when it was still dark and then he would take it to the pasture so that none of the shepherds would be aware of his job. When the Prophet (and Abu Bakr) went away (from the Cave), he (i.e. 'Amir) too went along with them and they both used to make him ride at the back of their camels in turns till they reached Medina. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-5/Book-59/Hadith-419/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5:59:419&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId492062&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;13th Objection: The prophet Muhammad wanted a grown-up wife for his children&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani Muslim Scholar Ghamidi also disputes the claim that 'Aisha was 9 at the time of consummation of marriage. His argument is that the Prophet desired a mature and grown-up wife to manage his household affairs and care for his young daughters. According to Ghamidi, 'Aisha's age at the time of Nikah was 16, and the consummation of marriage occurred when she was 19 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this explanation seems weak. If we were to accept 'Aisha's age as 16 at the time of Nikah, a 16-year-old woman could have easily taken care of the children and the household. Why, then, did the Prophet wait three more years (until she turned 19) to bring her into his home? If he truly needed a woman to run the household, he could have done so immediately after the Nikah and consummated the marriage. The three-year delay raises questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Prophet performed Nikah with 'Aisha even before marrying Sawdah. If 'Aisha was indeed 16 years old, there would have been no need for him to marry an older woman like Sawdah when a 16-year-old 'Aisha could have sufficiently taken care of his daughters and household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId663541&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;14th Objection: Verse 4:6 is proof that pre-pubescent girls cannot be married&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group of modern Islamic apologists also uses verse 4:6 as an argument to deny marriage to minor girls in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=6&quot;&gt;4:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;وَٱبْتَلُوا۟&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And test the orphans until when they reached the age of marriage (Nikah), then if you perceive in them sound judgement then deliver to them their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Modern Muslim preachers claim that one gets sound judgement about his wealth when one is already an adult person. Thus, this means that Islam prescribed that one can marry only after becoming an adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take note that the word &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Nikah&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah&quot;&gt;Nikah&lt;/a&gt;&quot; carries a double meaning in the Arabic language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Islamic Sharia, &quot;Nikah&quot; is a specific terminology with the meaning of &quot;marriage&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, in its literal sense in the Arabic language, &quot;Nikah&quot; refers to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah_%28Sexual_Consummation_of_Marriage%29&quot;&gt;sexual intercourse&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.34?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 17:34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ &lt;strong&gt;أَشُدَّهُۥ&lt;/strong&gt; ۚ&lt;br&gt;Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of &lt;strong&gt;full strength۔&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this verse, the term &quot;أَشُدَّهُ&quot; (full strength) denotes the age when young boys and girls begin to experience the desire or strength for sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take note of the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding Shar'i Nikah (marriage), there is no requirement for reaching the state of أَشُدَّهُ (full strength or sexual maturity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The evidence supporting this is that Muhammad himself performed the Shar'i Nikah with 'Aisha when she was only 6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not customary to test a 6-year-old child for handling their property, as they lack both أَشُدَّهُ (strength/desire) and the necessary &quot;sound judgment&quot; to manage their assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the concept of أَشُدَّهُ (strength) has no bearing on Shar'i Nikah, given that Muhammad married 'Aisha at the age of 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when 'Aisha came to Muhammad's house for the consummation of their marriage at the age of 9, she still lacked the mental acuity required to manage any property or business, as evident from the following hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-6130/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 6130:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, according to Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a girl reaches puberty, then she herself gets the right to give her consent for the marriage or to deny the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if she is a minor or prepubescent girl, then her father/guardian can wed her to anyone, even without her consent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if she is prepubescent and also an orphan, then her guardian has the right to wed her with himself (even without her consent), in order to get her property and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5064/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5064:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated 'Urwa: that he asked `Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! &lt;strong&gt;(This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr (bride-dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr&lt;/strong&gt;, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) &lt;strong&gt;to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reason that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no more considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islamqa.com, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet, also refutes these modern Muslim preachers regarding verse 6:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse 4:6 explains that an orphan’s money is given to him/her after they reach puberty and attain sound judgement. What’s meant by sound judgment is sound management of money. This can only happen after puberty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Reaching Nikah” mentioned in the verse means reaching puberty which can be known through sings such as menstruation for females and the growth of pubic hair. The verse used the expression “reaching Nikah” to actually mean “reaching puberty” because in most cases, it’s adults who perform Nikah. But this doesn’t mean that it’s not possible for non-adults to perform Nikah, which is permissible as proven by the Quran, Sunnah and the consensus of scholars. Plus, the same Surah and the same context of verses proves it (the permissibility of child marriage). (The verse that speaks about giving an orphan his money when he/she reaches Nikah is verse no.6) Verse no.3 says: “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. ”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse proves it’s allowed to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of Allah's Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning women..' (4.127) “&lt;a class=&quot;external free&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: &lt;strong&gt;“This shows it’s allowed to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Why Didn't Allah &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(224, 62, 45); text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;EXPLICITLY&lt;/span&gt; Ban Child Marriage in the Quran?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah possessed knowledge of the unseen future and foresaw the disagreements among Islamic scholars (with 99% ultimately allowing child marriage), why didn’t He reveal an explicit prohibition in the Quran to prevent the suffering of millions of underage Muslim girls over the past 14 centuries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries, billions of Muslims have believed that Islam permits the marriage of minor girls, citing Quranic verse 65:4 and numerous traditions (Ahadith) as justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a small minority of Muslims—less than 1%—reject this interpretation. They dispute the authenticity of Ahadith regarding ‘Aisha’s age at marriage and argue against traditional readings of verse 65:4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;central question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; remains: if Allah knew that countless innocent girls would suffer due to these false Ahadith and misinterpretations, why didn’t He include a &lt;strong&gt;clear, explicit verse&lt;/strong&gt; in the Quran banning the marriage of underage girls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a &lt;strong&gt;single unambiguous verse&lt;/strong&gt; would have resolved this issue and spared millions from harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran, a lengthy book, is filled with verses extolling Allah's power, recounting ancient stories, and threatening non-Muslims with eternal hellfire. However, on crucial human issues like this, it remains strikingly silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, millions of underage girls have suffered through the centuries, while Allah seemingly &quot;forgot&quot; to include a single verse addressing this pressing matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the Quran claims that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;easy to understand&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.17&quot;&gt;54:17&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its verses are &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;manifest&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/27.1?context=2&quot;&gt;27:1-2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was revealed in the Arabic language so that they could understand it (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/12.2&quot;&gt;12:2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a Book whose verses are perfectly explained—a Quran in Arabic for people who know (Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/41.3&quot;&gt;41:3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;Why did those billions of Muslims of the first 14 centuries still get misguided?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179;&quot;&gt;They firmly believed in this Quran from the depths of their hearts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;They read it day and night&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f02ff;&quot;&gt;They pondered upon it their entire lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Yet, they still arrived at interpretations that many modern Muslims now argue are misguided. If these billions of devoted followers, with their sincere efforts, failed to grasp the Quran's intended meaning, the problem does not lie with them—it lies with the Quran itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a deeper, more fundamental question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the Quran truly authored by an all-knowing deity, or does its ambiguity and silence on crucial issues reflect human limitations in its origins?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran's inability to prevent such widespread misguidance undermines its claim of being a flawless and divine revelation. It suggests that its clarity and comprehensibility are far from perfect, raising doubts about its divine authorship (i.e. No Allah is present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making the revelations on his own. Since he was only a human, thus we see these flaws in the Quran, where it is neither clear and easy to understand, nor able to guide billions of Muslims). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of 17 authentic Ahadith, which tell that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha was married at the age of 6,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the marriage was consummated when she was 9 years old. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And 4 of these Ahadith also tell that 'Aisha was 18 years old when Muhammad died. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, few of them are narrated by other people than Hisham (i.e. people who deny 'Aisha's age of 9 years at the time of consummation, they falsely claim that all such Ahadith are narrated by Hisham only). &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;There are traditions which don't mention the age of 'Aisha directly at the time of marriage, but they tell us that 'Aisha used to play with dolls after the marriage. This also proves that 'Aisha was still a child of 9 years old when she came into the house of Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-8/Book-73/Hadith-151/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6130&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;highlightable&quot;&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Muslim/In-Book/Book-16/Hadith-83&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 3311&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;hadith&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith__text arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;highlightable&quot;&gt;وَحَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ بْنُ حُمَيْدٍ، أَخْبَرَنَا عَبْدُ الرَّزَّاقِ، أَخْبَرَنَا مَعْمَرٌ، عَنِ الزُّهْرِيِّ، عَنْ عُرْوَةَ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم تَزَوَّجَهَا وَهْىَ بِنْتُ سَبْعِ سِنِينَ وَزُفَّتْ إِلَيْهِ وَهِيَ بِنْتُ تِسْعِ سِنِينَ وَلُعَبُهَا مَعَهَا وَمَاتَ عَنْهَا وَهِيَ بِنْتُ ثَمَانَ عَشْرَةَ ‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith__references&quot;&gt;'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modern Islamic apologists absolutely don't answer how can a 19-year-old girl play with dolls. So, their tactic is to totally neglect this proof. Nevertheless, this tactic does not work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId97711&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islam allows men to take sexual pleasure even from breastfed baby-girls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next problem is that marriage with non-adult girls is not limited only to 'Aisha, but it is a GENERAL Ruling that it is Halal (permissible) for a father to wed her non-adult daughter (even a baby girl) with any man of his own choice, without her consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other non-adult girls (except for 'Aisha) didn't have to absorb any knowledge to give it further (like in the case of 'Aisha as Islamic apologists claim). So, why did then Islam oppress them in this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islam allows men to marry minor girls and undress them, kiss their naked bodies, and rub their penises in their thighs to ejaculate, and take all other kinds of sexual pleasures from them (except penetration into their vaginas)&lt;/strong&gt;, even though those minor girls don't need to absorb any knowledge like 'Aisha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic website &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/islamweb.net&quot;&gt;islamweb.net&lt;/a&gt; gave this fatwa(&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20160129102417/http://fatwa.islamweb.net/fatwa/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;amp;lang=A&amp;amp;Id=78529&amp;amp;Option=FatwaId&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;الاستمتاع بالزوجة الصغيرة.. رؤية شرعية ۔۔۔&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Taking sexual pleasure from minor girl according to Sharia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فإنه لا حرجَ في تقبيلِ الزوجة الصغيرة بشهوة والمفاخذة ونحوَ ذلك ولو كانت لا تطيقُ الجماع وقد بيَّنَ العلماء أن الأصلَ جوازُ استمتاع الرجل بزوجته كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر وذكروا في ذلك استمناءَه بيدها ومداعبَتها وتقبيلَها وغير ذلك&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no problem to kiss the minor girl wife with intention of sexual pleasure and to do &quot;مفاخذہ&quot; which is to rub the penis between her thighs in order to ejaculate the sperms, or to do any other similar act&lt;/strong&gt;. All these acts of sexual pleasure are permitted, even if she does not possess the power for penetration. According to Ulama, a husband is free to enjoy her in every way till the time no harm is done to her. So, the minor girl could masturbate him, foreplay could be done with her, she could be kissed and similar other things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Fatwas about &lt;strong&gt;&quot;مفاخذہ&quot; (i.e. thighing)&lt;/strong&gt; are present &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Thighing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of the largest Websites for Muslims is Islamonline.net, which says a similar thing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20100125211912/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-Arabic-Ask_Scholar/FatwaA/FatwaA&amp;amp;cid=1122528623306&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;فإنه لا ضررَ في الإنزالِ بين فخذي الصغيرة التي لا تطيقُ الجماع وتتضررُ به إذا كان ذلك الإنزالُ بدونِ إيلاج، وقد بَيَّنَ العلماءُ أن الأصلَ هو جوازُ استمتاعِ الرجلِ بزوجتِه كيف شاء إذا لم يكن ضرر&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no problem if husband rubs his penis between the thighs of minor girl in order to ejaculate the sperm, even the minor girl does not possess the ability for penetration... According to the Islamic Scholars husband is allowed to enjoy the minor wife in every possible way till the time she is not harmed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islam allowed men to buy small baby slave girls from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, and then take all kinds of sexual pleasures from those slave babies and minor slave girls. It happened due to another evil of Islamic slavery, where Islam allowed the owners to take away the babies from their slave mothers when they got their first 2 molar teeth in pairs (i.e. when they were about 6 months old), and then to sell them in the slave markets. Read the details here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-part-1-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity&quot;&gt;Sharia of Islam: A slave mother and her baby can be separated and sold (in the Bazaars of slavery) after the baby has his two molar teeth (i.e. about 6 to 8 months)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are authentic reports where companions of Muhammad not only used to rape the captive women, but they also used to rape the captive small prepubescent girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Istibra &lt;/em&gt;is a period of sexual abstinence required till the first period of the captive girl is over. This is to ensure no confusion on paternity. Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.&lt;br&gt;As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read more details in this article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=71&amp;amp;catid=32&quot;&gt;Islam: Even a breastfed baby Girl can be married and used for sexual pleasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith__text arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId31951&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islam's Usurpation of a Small Girl's Right to Love through Forced Marriage without Consent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam permits the father or guardian to forcibly arrange a minor girl's Nikah with any man, regardless of his age, even if he is fifty years old. The father or guardian is not required to seek the minor girl's consent (and even if he asks, she is not in a position to give her consent due to her age).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, Abu Bakr arranged a 6-year-old Aisha's marriage to a 50-year-old individual like Muhammad without even consulting Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises a critical question: What opportunities does such a minor girl have to mature and experience natural love with someone of her own age group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is disheartening: she has absolutely no chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly astonishing that despite depriving small girls of the right to experience natural love, Islamists still claim Islam to be a religion of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId868182&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Extreme Dangers for teen mothers and their babies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at what modern science is telling you about the risks of death and injuries to small girls and their babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;1. Science says 25-30 is the age of least risk to mother and child for a first pregnancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;With the onset of puberty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory essentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology around the age of 25–30 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2.. The younger the mother, the greater the risk. Childbearing in adolescents aged 12–15 years in low resource countries: a neglected issue. New estimates from demographic and household surveys in 42 countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;It is frequently cited that girls who give birth aged 15–19 are more than twice as likely to die as those in their 20s (1, 2). However, this fails to capture the fact that risk increases with decreasing age. ......girls aged 15 or under had an odds ratio for maternal death four times higher than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;3. It is not just mortality, it's fistulas. Science says it is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;4. Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Many women and girls who manage to survive childbirth in these conditions may suffer from fistulas—holes that develop between the vaginal wall and the rectum or bladder. When a baby's head becomes lodged during birth, it can damage the mother's soft tissue between its skull and her pelvic bones, causing portions of the tissue to die and creating a hole. Consequently, faeces and urine leak through the opening and out of the vagina. Such a condition leads to societal rejection and divorce for affected women, and young girls face an even greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId692108&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Even if they survive, still the Children of teen mothers suffer dreadful health problems their entire life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The high mortality rate among children born to teen mothers is not the only issue; these children also endure other dreadful health problems throughout their entire lives&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is all this Data Islamophobic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId232338&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Two types of Islamic apologists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of Islamic apologists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first type of Islamic apologists accept that 'Aisha was indeed 6 years old when she was married. But they present other excuses to defend and justify it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second type of Islamic apologists who altogether deny that 'Aisah was 6 years old at the time of marriage. They try to prove that 'Aisha was 18 years old at the time of marriage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss and analyze all arguments by both of these two groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId150089&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 1st type of Islamic Apologists, who accept that 'Aisha was 6 years old, but present OTHER EXCUSES to justify it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId213625&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1st Excuse: Muhammad married 6 years old 'Aisha's while she had Ability to Acquire Knowledge at a Young Age&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers assert that Muhammad married young 'Aisha because she possessed the remarkable ability to absorb a vast amount of knowledge due to her tender age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquiring knowledge is not solely dependent on one's age but rather on their intelligence and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Hurayrah embraced Islam at the age of 26 and spent only three years with Muhammad. Yet, he absorbed a much larger amount of knowledge from Muhammad, narrating 5,374 hadiths, whereas 'Aisha, despite her younger age, narrated only 2,210 hadiths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad also had wives like Saffiyah and others who were between 15 to 20 years of age. An intelligent 16-year-old woman is likely to better comprehend complex issues, absorb knowledge, and preserve it compared to 'Aisha, who, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130&quot;&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari, 6130&lt;/a&gt;, used to play with dolls at the age of 9 years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 6130&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls &lt;strong&gt;in the presence of the Prophet (i.e. after the marriage was consummated at the age of 9 years)&lt;/strong&gt;, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId550566&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2nd Excuse: Muhammad married 6 years old  'Aisha so that she could Educate Others about Islam after Muhammad's Death&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers often use the argument that Muhammad married young 'Aisha so that she could live long after his death to disseminate his teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that Muhammad also had wives like Saffiyah and others who were between 15 to 20 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there truly exists an Allah, then he could have extended the life of any of Muhammad's wives. For example, a 16-year-old wife of Muhammad could also have lived long enough to spread his knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Aisha passed away at the age of 65 years. So, wouldn't it have been equally possible for Allah to prolong the life of any other adult wife of Muhammad to 70 or 80 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId768299&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3rd Excuse: 'Aisha's was SATISFIED with the Marriage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers assert that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha had no problem with being married at 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Aisha’s father, family, and tribe had no problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the arch-enemies of the Prophet (who were always looking to attack him) had no problem!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But only the &quot;illiterates&quot; of the 21st century say: We have a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, at times, oppression reaches such extremes that individuals forget about their fundamental human rights and begin to perceive the oppression as acceptable. A similar phenomenon was witnessed when Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery. Some slaves, despite gaining freedom, returned to their former owners due to the deep brainwashing they had endured. They had been convinced that being slaves and deprived of basic human rights was their rightful place. However, these wicked customs and societal practices remain unjust, even if they succeed in manipulating oppressed individuals into believing their fate is tied to these evils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if the arch-enemies of Muhammad didn't criticize him for any crime while they also practised it, then it does not make Muhammad free of blame. For example, if Muhammad had also started killing the newborn baby girls and his arch-enemies would have not criticized him for that (while they also did the same, as Muslims claim), did it make Muhammad free of blame too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the 2 dominant neighbouring empires had already prohibited intercourse with 9-year-old girls before Muhammad (you will see the proof later in this article). In Roman Egypt, Basra etc. a man could get severe punishments for seducing a girl under 13 because she was considered too young to give consent and not capable of fully understanding the risks to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, you claim that Muhammad had the best &lt;strong&gt;Morals&lt;/strong&gt;. So how come this man with eternally perfect morals couldn’t see that marrying a 6-year-old was morally wrong? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you claim that Muhammad's morals were perfect for eternity, and his Sunnah (practices) should be followed in all eras, then you are automatically making marriage to a 6-year-old baby girl Halal (i.e. permissible) &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt; too. We can just hope that Muslims can understand the &lt;strong&gt;dangers&lt;/strong&gt; of the claim of these so-called eternal Morals of the Prophet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId306409&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4th Excuse: Intercourse with 9 years old girls was a norm in the era of Muhammad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam preachers also come up with an excuse that it was tradition of that era that minor girls were also married without their consent, so we should not question this Islamic Ruling today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, this erroneous Islamic ruling is subject to scrutiny for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, even if we were to assume that it was a prevalent practice during that era, the question arises as to why Allah/Muhammad did not abolish and prohibit this wrong practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, Muhammad did not even verbally condemn this practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contrast, he encouraged it by establishing it as a Sunnah through his marriage to 'Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the claims made by Islamic preachers that this practice was common during that time are not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) The Jews at the time had already set the marriage age to 12:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D'Rabbi_Natan?tab=contents%20%22Composed:%20Talmudic%20Israel/Babylon,%20c.650%20-%20c.950%20CE%20Avot%20d%E2%80%99Rabbi%20Natan&quot;&gt;Pious and Rebellious,Grossman, Avraham;,Brandeis University Press&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Intense opposition to the marriage of young girls is brought in the name of R. Shimon bar Yohai, that “Whoever marries off his daughter when she is young minimizes the bearing of children and loses his money and comes to bloodshed.”5 5. Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, Version II, ch. 48, p. 66. The concern is that the young girl may become pregnant and die as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) Romans:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500 years before Muhammed, doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soranus_of_Ephesus&quot;&gt;Soranus&lt;/a&gt; wrote his book about gynaecology and in hit he stated that women could be considered fit for conception from 15. 15 is significantly older than 9. Soranus was from Ephesos and worked in Alexandria before he moved to Rome. So he had met desert-conditions girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soranus wrote in his book: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/book/2189958/9b5cce/soranus-gynecology.html&quot;&gt;Soranus, Of Ephesus and Owsei Temkin (1994) &lt;em&gt;Soranus’ gynecology&lt;/em&gt;. Baltimore Johns Hopkins Univ. Press.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 233):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book about gynecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &quot;For it obtains whenever women married before maturity conceive and give birth while the uterus has not yet fully grown nor the fundus of (the) uterus expanded.&quot; So they knew the pelvic floor and birth canal were not mature enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 227)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... difficult labor occur in those who give birth in a way which is contrary to nature? Diocles the Caerystan in the second book on gynecology says that primiparae and young women have difficult labor&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Recognize Those Capable of Conception:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since women usually are married for the sake of children and succession and not for mere enjoyment and since it is utterly absurd to make inquiries about the excellence of their lineage and the abundance of their means but to leave unexamined whether they can conceive or not and whether they are fit for childbearing or not it is only right for us to give an account of the matter in question One must judge the majority from the ages of 15 to 40 to be fit for conception&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here was the law in the Roman Empire before Muhammad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/146/abstract/roman-law-and-marriage-underage-girls&quot;&gt;Roman Law and the Marriage of Underage Girls&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;Twelve will seem to us undesirably young, and indeed ancient doctors such as Soranus warned against the dangers of women becoming sexually active at so early an age. Most Roman women appear to have married later, from about 15 to 20. But the possibility of efarlier marriage we know to have been actively pursued especially in upper-class families, where marriage often assisted dynastic alliances.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Sparta:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In fact, Sparta raised the marriage age from 18 to 20 with the primary aim of decreasing the number of sickly children. As a result, they observed an increase in life expectancy for women, which began to rival that of men. It became evident that child marriage was the main contributing factor to mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While Athenian women might have expected to marry for the first time around the &lt;strong&gt;age of fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; to men much older than them, Spartan women normally married between the ages of eighteen and twenty to men close to them in age.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-FOOTNOTECartledge198194–95_29-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTECartledge198194%E2%80%9395-29&quot;&gt;[29]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Spartan ideology, the primary role of adult women was to bear and raise healthy children. This focus on childbearing was likely responsible for the emphasis on physical fitness in Spartan women, as it was believed that physically stronger women would have healthier children.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlundell1995157-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bearing and raising children was considered the most important role for women in Spartan society; equal to male warriors in the Spartan army.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-50&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-50&quot;&gt;[50]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Spartan women were encouraged to produce many children, preferably male, to increase Sparta's military population. They took pride in having borne and raised brave warriors.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-51&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-51&quot;&gt;[51]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hence, even with an emphasis on bearing numerous children, Sparta raised the age of marriage for women to 18–20 years. Interestingly, this decision did not hinder Spartan women from having many children. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in the mortality rate among both mothers and children. Additionally, this measure curbed the birth of weak offspring prone to diseases. As a result, only healthy and robust children were born, growing up to become outstanding warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId452798&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5th Excuse: The SHORTER life span in that era was the reason for early marriages of 9-year-old girls&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Muslim Apologists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://muslimskeptic.com/author/drjou/&quot;&gt;Daniel Haquiqajou&lt;/a&gt; come up with excuses like (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Video link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vast majority of history, life expectancy was relatively low. Moreover, infant mortality was considerably high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, it was then necessary to use the extent of the 'fertility window' for reproduction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is why Islam didn't prohibit this practice, but the prophet Muhammad himself married a 9-year-old 'Aisha. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Many societies did not breed 9 or 10-year-old prepubescent girls and did just fine. In fact, Sparta raised the marriage age from 18 to 20 with the primary aim of decreasing the number of sickly children. As a result, they observed an increase in life expectancy for women, which began to rival that of men. It became evident that child marriage was the main contributing factor to mortality rates. Hence, even with an emphasis on bearing numerous children, Sparta raised the age of marriage for women to 18–20 years. Interestingly, this decision did not hinder Spartan women from having many children. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in the mortality rate among both mothers and children. Additionally, this measure curbed the birth of weak offspring prone to diseases. As a result, only healthy and robust children were born, growing up to become outstanding warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId714389&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Earlier_puberty_and_menarchy_in_the_past&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;6th Excuse: Girls got Puberty Earlier in the past&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of menarche (i.e. the first menstrual period in a female adolescent) today is about 11 to 12 years among girls. But Islamic apologists claim that puberty occurred earlier in the past, and thus it was ok for Muhammad to have sex with 9 years old 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, please note that 'Aisha didn't get menarche when Muhammad had intercourse with her at the age of 9 years, but she was still prepubescent. There is absolutely no proof that she got her menses at the age of 9, but modern-day Muslims have fabricated this claim on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-8/Book-73/Hadith-151/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6130&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;highlightable&quot;&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, &lt;strong&gt;not yet reached the age of puberty&lt;/strong&gt;.) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran (verse 65:4) allows men to have intercourse with prepubescent girls who have not reached puberty yet (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/marriage-rape-of-minor-girls/71-islam-even-a-breastfed-baby-girl-could-be-married-and-used-for-sexual-pleasure#mozTocId151488&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, menarche does not mean that a girl has become able to have sex mentally and physically and have a child. There are girls who today get menarche at the age of 8 years or 7 years or 6 years or even at the age of 5 years. Does it mean it is ok to do sex with a 5 years old girl? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH4&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId814603&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;7th Excuse: Nature is on Islam's side while puberty is an indication one has to start a sex life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous Islamic apologist Daniel Haqiqatjou came up with this excuse in his video (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G5Qarvt9Tk&amp;amp;t=2878s&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). He further claims that not having sex at puberty causes children to indulge in masturbation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this claim is unfounded for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary issue lies in Muslims' belief that their Allah is 100% perfect and that Allah has created a 100% perfect nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, nature is not flawlessly tailored for humans or any other species. Nature follows its course, and as humans, we must adapt ourselves to its demands; otherwise, we face the risk of extinction. The same holds true for all other species as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While animals may be biologically ready for sexual activity at the onset of puberty, humans are different in this regard. There is a significant distinction between animals and humans in terms of their development and behavior, as humans undergo complex psychological, emotional, and social changes during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animals don't need the &quot;consent&quot; of a weaker partner, but they go for forced sex. But humans have the ability of thinking, and we have human rights, and giving &quot;consent&quot; is one of our fundamental rights. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But Islam turns humans again into animals again. It took away the right of minor girls to give their consent, but their fathers can force them into sex with any man of their choice (even if he is an old man).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even puberty at the age of 9-12 is not enough to become &lt;strong&gt;mentally&lt;/strong&gt; sound enough to choose a suitable partner. Mental maturity is totally different from physical maturity, and one becomes mentally mature at the age of 16 to 18 years. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And animals may be &quot;naturally&quot; able to have sex and to have babies as soon as they become adults. But this is not the case with humans. We have provided all proof above of how girls at 12 (when they get puberty) are still at huge risk of different diseases including Fistula and death at the time of delivery. Similarly, how their babies are at extremely higher risk of dying during delivery or of suffering many diseases even after birth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, does the fear of indulging in masturbation is a good enough excuse to indulge in the dangerous (and in some cases, life-threatening) practice of sex with grown-up men and pregnancy and delivery of babies? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Muslim men were never satisfied with their one (or even four wives). They were constantly raping slave girls, and then selling them and then buying new slave girls for them. They were also swapping their slave girls among themselves. They were also taking the slave wives of their male slaves, raping them, and then returning them to their male slaves after fulfilling their lust. Please read this article for details and proof: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=47&amp;amp;catid=16&quot;&gt;Part 1: Crimes of Islamic Slavery against Humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId975181&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 2nd type of Islamic apologists, who altogether deny that 'Aisah was 6 years old at the time of marriage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us see and analyze their objections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId125063&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1st Objection: All these traditions are narrated by only one person i.e. Hisham bin 'Urwa and none from Medina narrated it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But this objection is false. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The traditions about 'Aisha's age at the time of marriage have been narrated by multiple alternative chains of narrations, including the people of Medina too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Sheikh Haddad is a Sunni Hadith Master, and he replied to this objection as following (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Al-Zuhri also reports it from `&lt;strong&gt;Urwa &lt;/strong&gt;(i.e. Hisham's father directly), from `A'isha; so does &lt;strong&gt;`Abd Allah ibn Dhakwan&lt;/strong&gt;, both major Madanis. So is the &lt;strong&gt;Tabi`i Yahya al-Lakhmi&lt;/strong&gt; who reports it from her in the Musnad and in Ibn Sa`d's Tabaqat. So is Abu Ishaq Sa`d ibn Ibrahim who reports it from &lt;strong&gt;Imam al-Qasim ibn Muhammad&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the Seven Imams of Madina, from `A'isha. All the narratives of this event have been reported. In addition to the above four Madinese Tabi`in narrators, Sufyan ibn `Uyayna from Khurasan and `Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya from Tabarayya in Palestine both report it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId772324&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2nd Objection: Revelation time of surah al-Qamar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-6/Book-60/Hadith-399/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;),  'Aisha explains she was a &quot;playful girl&quot; (jariyatun al-'abu لَجَارِيَةٌ أَلْعَبُ) when Surah (chapter) al-Qamar of the Quran was revealed. This group of modern Islam apologists claim that Surah al-Qamar was revealed 9 years before Hijrah, which makes 'Aisha to be much older than 6 years at the time of marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are wrong as there is no proof present that Surah al-Qamar was revealed 9 years before Hijrah. Sheikh Haddad refutes them by stating (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hadith Masters, Sira historians, and Qur'anic commentators agree that the splitting of the moon took place about five years before the Holy Prophet's (upon him blessings and peace) Hijra to Madina. Thus it is confirmed that our Mother `Aisha was born between seven and eight years before the Hijra and the words that she was a jariya or little girl five years before the Hijra match the fact that her age at the time Surat al-Qamar was revealed was around 2 or 3. A two year old is not an infant. A two year old is able to run around, which is what jariya means. As for &quot;the comments of the experts&quot; they concur on 6 or 7 as the age of marriage and 9 as the age of cohabitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId140333&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3rd Objection: &lt;span id=&quot;Battle_of_Badr_and_Uhud&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Battle of Badr and Uhud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This apologetic argument aims to make the claim that Aisha was at the Battles of Badr and Uhud, and that since standard practice at the time disallowed anyone under 15 from joining the battlefield, she could not have been younger than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaykh Haddad responds to this apologetic argument (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the prohibition applied to combatants. It applied neither to non-combatant boys nor to non-combatant girls and women. Second, `A'isha did not participate in Badr at all but bade farewell to the combatants as they were leaving Madina, as narrated by Muslim in his Sahih. On the day of Uhud (year 3), Anas, at the time only twelve or thirteen years old, reports seeing an eleven-year old `A'isha and his mother Umm Sulaym having tied up their dresses and carrying water skins back and forth to the combatants, as narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId643739&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4th Objection: &lt;span id=&quot;Age_of_Asma&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Age of Asma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a title=&quot;Sahih&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Sahih#Da.27if&quot;&gt;da'if&lt;/a&gt; (weak) hadith narrated from al-Zinad and recorded in the works of some medieval scholars, including al-Dhahabi (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/124483/how-old-was-aishah-when-she-married-the-prophet&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), states that Aisha's older sister Asma was ten years older than her. This has been combined with improbable information about Asma being 100 years old at the time of her death in 73 AH to calculate that Aisha was eighteen or nineteen at the time of her marriage consummation (1 AH or 2 AH - (73 - 100) - 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;Shaykh Haddad (link)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/124483/how-old-was-aishah-when-she-married-the-prophet&quot;&gt;IslamQA (link)&lt;/a&gt; website both independently criticise this approach as relying on a single narrator, who most scholars regard as weak, and note that a hadith by a more reliable chain from the same narrator gives a broader range for the age difference between the sisters. Both also note that al-Dhahabi too gave the vaguer opinion that Asma was &quot;ten or more&quot; years older than Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId562874&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Tabari's_account_of_Abu_Bakr's_children_and_wives&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Tabari.27s_account_of_Abu_Bakr.27s_children_and_wives&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;5th Objection: Tabari's account of Abu Bakr's children and wives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologists claim that &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Tabari&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Tabari&quot;&gt;al-Tabari's&lt;/a&gt; recorded that Aisha was born in the pre-islamic period, and thus could not have been less than 14 tears old (Reference: Al-Tabari, Vol. 4, Pg. 50, Arabic, Dar al-fikr, Beirut, 1979)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, al-Tabari's own account reports at least five times that Aisha was around 6-7 years old during marriage and the marriage was consummated 3 years later (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha%27s_Age#Tabari.27s_account_of_Abu_Bakr.27s_children_and_wives&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Shaykh Gibril Haddad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) says that the initial passage mentioned is misinterpreted, stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Al-Tabari nowhere reports that 'Abu Bakr's four children were all born in Jahiliyya' but only that Abu Bakr married both their mothers in Jahiliyya, Qutayla bint Sa`d and Umm Ruman, who bore him four children in all, two each, `A'isha being the daughter of Umm Ruman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId444946&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Time_of_Umar's_conversion_to_Islam&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Time_of_Umar.27s_conversion_to_Islam&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;6th Objection: Time of Umar's conversion to Islam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument draws on &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sira&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Sira&quot;&gt;al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah&lt;/a&gt; (Biography of the Prophet) to claim that since Ayesha converted to Islam before Umar she could not have been born during the first year of Islam (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha%27s_Age#Time_of_Umar.27s_conversion_to_Islam&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even if the claim Aisha converted to Islam before Umar was true, it does not mean this took place during the first year of Islam, since Umar converted in 617 AD, about 4 years after Aisha’s birth in 613 AD (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha%27s_Age#cite_note-Siddiqui-1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, Aisha never remembered a time before when her family wasn't Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-5/Book-58/Hadith-245/&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides disputing the claim that Ibn Hisham reported that Aisha accepted Islam quite sometime before `Umar ibn al-Khattab, Shaykh Haddad also casts doubt on the claim stating (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere does Ibn Hisham say this. Rather, Ibn Hisham lists `A'isha among 'those that accepted Islam because of Abu Bakr.' This does not mean that she embraced Islam during the first year of Islam. Nor does it mean that she necessarily embraced Islam before `Umar (year 6) although she was born the previous year (year 7 before the Hijra) although it is understood she will automatically follow her father's choice even before the age of reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId128737&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Tabari's_account_of_Abu_Bakr's_migration_to_Habshah&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Tabari.27s_account_of_Abu_Bakr.27s_migration_to_Habshah&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;7th Objection: Tabari's account of Abu Bakr's migration to Habshah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument claims that al-Tabari states that when Abu Bakr was planning to migrate to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), he spoke to Mut`am, with whose son, Jabayr, Aisha was engaged. This migration occurred eight years before hijrah, at which time Aisha had only just been born if she consummated her marriage to Muhammad at the age of 9 or 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of this claim admit they have no primary source, which originated in Kandhalvi's Urdu booklet (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamawareness.net/FAQ/what_was_ayesha.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Shayk Haddad responds that &quot;there is no mention of emigration in Tabari's account of Abu Bakr's discussion with Mut`im&quot; and &quot;there had been only some preliminary talk, not a formal arrangement&quot;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Haddad_45-8&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha%27s_Age#cite_note-Haddad-45&quot;&gt;[45]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId687997&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_meaning_of_bikr&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;8th Objection: The meaning of &lt;em&gt;bikr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument cites a hadith in Ibn Hanbal's Musnad saying that Khaulah suggested Aisha to Muhammad as a virgin (bikr) he could marry. The claim is that bikr would not be used for a young girl (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamawareness.net/FAQ/what_was_ayesha.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are multiple sahih hadith narrations of a highly relevant conversation between Muhammad and Jabir in which bikr (virgin) is clearly compatible with jariyah (young girl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated Jabir: &quot;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, &quot;Have you got married O Jabir?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He asked &quot;What, a virgin [bikr] or a matron [thayyib]?&quot; I replied, &quot;Not a virgin but a matron.&quot; He said, &quot;Why did you not marry a young girl [jariyah] who would have fondled with you?
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes_ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-5/Book-59/Hadith-382/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5:59:382&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaykh Haddad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) says regarding the claim, &quot;This is ignorant nonsense, bikr means a virgin girl, a girl who has never been married even if her age is 0 and there is no unclarity here whatsoever.&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId656180&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Fatima's_age_difference&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Fatima.27s_age_difference&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;9th Objection: Fatima's age difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This claim is that according to ibn Hajar, Fatima was five years older than Aisha and Muhammad was 35 years old when Fatima was born. Therefore, based on this claim, Aisha must have been a teenager at the time her marriage was consummated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the proponent of this claim (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamawareness.net/FAQ/what_was_ayesha.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) has combined and selectively quoted conflicting sources. Shaykh Haddad responds (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livingislam.org/ir/d/aam1_e.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar mentions two versions: (1) al-Waqidi's narration that Fatima was born when the Prophet was 35; and (2) Ibn `Abd al-Barr's narration that she was born when he was 41, approximately one year more or less before Prophethood, and about five years before `A'isha was born. The latter version matches the established dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId448784&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Hadith_saying_Aisha_had_reached_puberty&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;10th Objection: Hadith said Aisha had reached puberty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is based on a mistranslated hadith, Sahih Bukhari 1:8:465, which in one English translation states that Aisha had seen her parents follow Islam since the age of puberty, and not a day passed by without Muhammad visiting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the age of puberty. Not a day passed but the Prophet (ﷺ) visited us, both in the mornings and evenings[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-1/Book-8/Hadith-465/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 1:8:465&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the word أَعْقِلْ means thoughts or reasoning, but the translator, Muhsin Khan, has used the word 'puberty'. The meaning rather is simply that 'Aisha was aware that her parents were following Islam. A literal translation would be &quot;I was not aware of my parents other than that the two of them both acknowledged the religion&quot;. The exact same Arabic phrase is translated correctly by the same translator in another narration of the same hadith (&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-3/Book-37/Hadith-494/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId978256&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Hadith_in_which_Aisha_mensturated&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;11th Objection: Hadith in which Aisha menstruated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is also based on a mistranslated hadith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud 4915 (Ahmad Hasan numbering; 4933 Dar-us-Salam):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) married me when I was seven or six. When we came to Medina, some women came. according to Bishr's version: Umm Ruman came to me when I was swinging. They took me, made me prepared and decorated me. I was then brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and he took up cohabitation with me when I was nine. She halted me at the door, and I burst into laughter. Abu Dawud said: That is to say: I menstruated, and I was brought in a house, and there were some women of the Ansari in it. They said: With good luck and blessing. The tradition of one of them has been included in the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes_ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/AbuDawud/Hasan/Hadith-4915/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud 4915 (Ahmad Hasan Ref)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad Hasan mistranslates Abu Dawud's comment as &quot;That is to say: I menstruated&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aisha's phrase &quot;I burst into laughter&quot; is fa-qultu heeh heeh (فَقُلْتُ هِيهْ هِيهْ), &quot;And I said heh, heh&quot;. The Dar-us-Salam English-Arabic edition of Sunan Abu Dawud translated by Nasiruddin al-Khattab (Hadith 4933) renders Aisha's words here: &quot;She made me stand at the door &lt;strong&gt;and I started to breathe deeply&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; (Dar-us-Salam does not include Abu Dawud's comment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dawud's comment is &quot;ay tanaffasat (أَىْ تَنَفَّسَتْ)&quot;, which is &quot;That is to say 'I breathed'&quot;. The verb nun-fa-sin is used here in Arabic form V with the ta prefix and shadda (doubled) middle letter, which Lane's Lexicon says means &quot;breathed&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId686475&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Aisha_remembered_the_migration_setting_out_to_Abyssinia&quot; class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;12th Objection: Aisha remembered the migration setting out to Abyssinia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hadith has been commonly misinterpreted in order to claim that Aisha remembered Muhammad coming to Abu Bakr when it was time to migrate to Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia). This forced migration occurred due to what Urwa b. al-Zubayr in his first letter describes as the first persecution (&lt;em&gt;al-fitnah al-ūlā&lt;/em&gt;) in Mecca, before the migration some years later to Medina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hadith itself does not state which migration it relates too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Aisha: Rarely did the Prophet (ﷺ) fail to visit Abu Bakr's house everyday, either in the morning or in the evening. When the permission for migration to Medina was granted, all of a sudden the Prophet (ﷺ) came to us at noon and Abu Bakr was informed, who said, &quot;Certainly the Prophet (ﷺ) has come for some urgent matter.&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said to Abu Bakr, when the latter entered &quot;Let nobody stay in your home.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! There are only my two daughters (namely `Aisha and Asma') present.&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;I feel (am informed) that I have been granted the permission for migration.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;I will accompany you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;You will accompany me.&quot; Abu Bakr then said &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have two she-camels I have prepared specially for migration, so I offer you one of them. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;I have accepted it on the condition that I will pay its price.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-3/Book-34/Hadith-348/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 3:34:348&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hadith shows clearly that the above hadith actually refers to the migration to Medina, not Abyssinia. Notice the similar phrasing about Muhammad coming to Abu Bakr at noon after being granted permission to migrate. At the end of the quote, &lt;strong&gt;Medina&lt;/strong&gt; is mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated `Aisha: Abu Bakr asked the Prophet (ﷺ) to allow him to go out (of Mecca) when he was greatly annoyed (by the infidels). But the Prophet (ﷺ) said to him, &quot;Wait.&quot; Abu Bakr said, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Do you hope that you will be allowed (to migrate)?&quot; Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, &quot;I hope so.&quot; So Abu Bakr waited for him till one day Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came at noon time and addressed him saying &quot;Let whoever is present with you, now leave you.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;None is present but my two daughters.&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;Have you noticed that I have been allowed to go out (to migrate)?&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle, I would like to accompany you.&quot; The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;You will accompany me.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have got two she-camels which I had prepared and kept ready for (our) going out.&quot; So he gave one of the two (she-camels) to the Prophet (ﷺ) and it was Al-Jad`a. They both rode and proceeded till they reached the Cave at the mountain of Thaur where they hid themselves. Amir bin Fuhaira was the slave of `Abdullah bin at-Tufail bin Sakhbara `Aisha's brother from her mother's side. Abu Bakr had a milch she-camel. Amir used to go with it (i.e. the milch she-camel) in the afternoon and come back to them before noon by setting out towards them in the early morning when it was still dark and then he would take it to the pasture so that none of the shepherds would be aware of his job. When the Prophet (and Abu Bakr) went away (from the Cave), he (i.e. 'Amir) too went along with them and they both used to make him ride at the back of their camels in turns till they reached Medina. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-5/Book-59/Hadith-419/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5:59:419&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId492062&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;13th Objection: The prophet Muhammad wanted a grown-up wife for his children&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani Muslim Scholar Ghamidi also disputes the claim that 'Aisha was 9 at the time of consummation of marriage. His argument is that the Prophet desired a mature and grown-up wife to manage his household affairs and care for his young daughters. According to Ghamidi, 'Aisha's age at the time of Nikah was 16, and the consummation of marriage occurred when she was 19 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this explanation seems weak. If we were to accept 'Aisha's age as 16 at the time of Nikah, a 16-year-old woman could have easily taken care of the children and the household. Why, then, did the Prophet wait three more years (until she turned 19) to bring her into his home? If he truly needed a woman to run the household, he could have done so immediately after the Nikah and consummated the marriage. The three-year delay raises questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Prophet performed Nikah with 'Aisha even before marrying Sawdah. If 'Aisha was indeed 16 years old, there would have been no need for him to marry an older woman like Sawdah when a 16-year-old 'Aisha could have sufficiently taken care of his daughters and household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId663541&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;14th Objection: Verse 4:6 is proof that pre-pubescent girls cannot be married&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group of modern Islamic apologists also uses verse 4:6 as an argument to deny marriage to minor girls in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=6&quot;&gt;4:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;وَٱبْتَلُوا۟&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And test the orphans until when they reached the age of marriage (Nikah), then if you perceive in them sound judgement then deliver to them their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Modern Muslim preachers claim that one gets sound judgement about his wealth when one is already an adult person. Thus, this means that Islam prescribed that one can marry only after becoming an adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take note that the word &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Nikah&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah&quot;&gt;Nikah&lt;/a&gt;&quot; carries a double meaning in the Arabic language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Islamic Sharia, &quot;Nikah&quot; is a specific terminology with the meaning of &quot;marriage&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, in its literal sense in the Arabic language, &quot;Nikah&quot; refers to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah_%28Sexual_Consummation_of_Marriage%29&quot;&gt;sexual intercourse&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.34?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 17:34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ &lt;strong&gt;أَشُدَّهُۥ&lt;/strong&gt; ۚ&lt;br&gt;Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of &lt;strong&gt;full strength۔&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this verse, the term &quot;أَشُدَّهُ&quot; (full strength) denotes the age when young boys and girls begin to experience the desire or strength for sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take note of the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding Shar'i Nikah (marriage), there is no requirement for reaching the state of أَشُدَّهُ (full strength or sexual maturity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The evidence supporting this is that Muhammad himself performed the Shar'i Nikah with 'Aisha when she was only 6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not customary to test a 6-year-old child for handling their property, as they lack both أَشُدَّهُ (strength/desire) and the necessary &quot;sound judgment&quot; to manage their assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the concept of أَشُدَّهُ (strength) has no bearing on Shar'i Nikah, given that Muhammad married 'Aisha at the age of 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when 'Aisha came to Muhammad's house for the consummation of their marriage at the age of 9, she still lacked the mental acuity required to manage any property or business, as evident from the following hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-6130/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 6130:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, according to Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a girl reaches puberty, then she herself gets the right to give her consent for the marriage or to deny the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if she is a minor or prepubescent girl, then her father/guardian can wed her to anyone, even without her consent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if she is prepubescent and also an orphan, then her guardian has the right to wed her with himself (even without her consent), in order to get her property and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5064/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5064:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated 'Urwa: that he asked `Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! &lt;strong&gt;(This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr (bride-dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr&lt;/strong&gt;, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) &lt;strong&gt;to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reason that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no more considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islamqa.com, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet, also refutes these modern Muslim preachers regarding verse 6:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse 4:6 explains that an orphan’s money is given to him/her after they reach puberty and attain sound judgement. What’s meant by sound judgment is sound management of money. This can only happen after puberty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Reaching Nikah” mentioned in the verse means reaching puberty which can be known through sings such as menstruation for females and the growth of pubic hair. The verse used the expression “reaching Nikah” to actually mean “reaching puberty” because in most cases, it’s adults who perform Nikah. But this doesn’t mean that it’s not possible for non-adults to perform Nikah, which is permissible as proven by the Quran, Sunnah and the consensus of scholars. Plus, the same Surah and the same context of verses proves it (the permissibility of child marriage). (The verse that speaks about giving an orphan his money when he/she reaches Nikah is verse no.6) Verse no.3 says: “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. ”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse proves it’s allowed to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of Allah's Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning women..' (4.127) “&lt;a class=&quot;external free&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: &lt;strong&gt;“This shows it’s allowed to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Islam made it Halal for the foster Muslim father to marry his minor adopted (orphan) daughter by force (without even her consent) if he got a desire for her due to her beauty:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.3&quot;&gt;4:3&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Muhammad was forced to claim the revelation of this verse? The following tradition of ‘Aisha makes it clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5064&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5064&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;('Urwa narrated from ‘Aisha that she said about this verse 4:3) &quot;O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her &lt;strong&gt;wealth and beauty&lt;/strong&gt; and intends to marry her with a Mahr (i.e. money for dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr (i.e. Dowry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=127&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَيَسْتَفْتُونَكَ فِي النِّسَاءِ قُلِ اللّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِيهِنَّ وَمَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الْكِتَابِ فِي يَتَامَى النِّسَاءِ الَّاتِي لاَ تُؤْتُونَهُنَّ مَا كُتِبَ لَهُنَّ وَتَرْغَبُونَ أَن تَنكِحُوهُنَّ وَالْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الْوِلْدَانِ وَأَن تَقُومُواْ لِلْيَتَامَى بِالْقِسْطِ وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ بِهِ عَلِيمًا&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned girls (in your charge) to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage, as well as in respect of helpless (male) children (الْوِلْدَانِ children: genitive masculine plural noun), that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reason that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no more considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic website IslamQA writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse (i.e. Quran 4:3) proves it’s allowed (for a foster father) to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;This shows it’s allowed (for a foster father) to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident of the marriage of Muhammad with the ex-wife of his adopted son was later used by one greedy Sahabi (companion of Muhammad) who got a lust for her minor adopted daughter due to her beauty and her wealth, and he took her into her Nikah by force. (Note: No foster mother, and no Islamic court, is able to stop the Muslim foster father to marry his minor adopted daughter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it seems that the Arab Society (which Islam and Muslims blame to be from the time of Ignorance) protested against it, as they had already protested in the case of Muhammad when he first wished to marry his daughter-in-law. Moreover, that greedy companion also wished to loot that little orphan girl by giving less money as dowry, and secondly, to take complete control of her wealth as her husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, no one was able to stop that companion directly, as Muhammad had already set complete precedence himself for this before, by committing two actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, Muhammad did Nikah with 6 years old minor ‘Aisha, and her father Abu Bakr didn’t need any consent from little ‘Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, Muhammad had destroyed the bond between the adopted children and the foster parents and had married his own daughter-in-law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, despite the protest, Muhammad didn’t stop him or punish him from taking the minor adopted daughter into his Nikah, but in order to avoid criticism, he only asked him to pay the full money for the dowry, and he also tried to lure his companion by inviting him to marry 2 or 3 or 4 of others women, who pleased him, but to leave the orphan girl apart if he fears to not to do justice with her wealth (i.e. due to money for a dowry, or due to taking full control over her wealth). Nevertheless, this was also only a “recommendation” and if a greedy Muslim foster father still wishes to marry the minor adopted daughter in order to take full control over her wealth, then NO Islamic Court could stop him from doing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Natural Bond between parents and adopted children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child does not care who gave birth to him, but he will go towards the one who fosters him, who loves him, and who takes care of him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, when a woman or a man fosters a child, then a natural bond is created between them. In the whole world, in each and every nation, all the modern psychiatrists accept this natural bond, except Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “bond of fostering” is stronger than the “bond of blood”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing exists even among animals too. If you keep the eggs of duck under the hen, then the ducklings will consider that hen to be their mother and follow her while she takes care of them. Even if a cat takes care of ducklings, then they will consider that cat to be their mother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The status of the one who fosters the child is HIGHER than the status of the one who gave birth to the child.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Fatwa: Adopted son should be separated from his mother after becoming an adult&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see more cruelty of this Islamic ruling, then look at this fatwa (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.banuri.edu.pk/readquestion/mun-bole-betay-se-parde-ka-hukum/01-01-2010&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), where a Muslim mother was crying and refused to be separated from her adopted son (while he became an adult at age of 12-13 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the relatives wanted to forcefully separate them (i.e. the mother and the adopted child) from each other, and the Muslim Mufti supported the action of the relatives while it is indeed the order of Allah in Islam, as Allah fears that it will cause the Fitna of fornication if both Na-Mahrams (i.e. mother and her 12-14 years old adopted son) stay together under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islam snatched away the right to have any FAMILY from an orphan child&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only an adopted male child is separated from his mother (after becoming an adult), but he is also separated from his sisters too, while they are also counted as Na-Mahrams. He is kicked out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the case of an orphan girl is even worse. She is not only a Na-Mahram to her brothers, but also to her father right from the beginning. Not only could her father look at her with lust right from the beginning, but also her brothers could also look at her with lust right from the beginning (i.e. they never look at her as a daughter or a sister, but as a sexual object right from the beginning). In simple words, Islam snatched away the right to have any family from poor orphan children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PS: Islam also denied the orphan children any inheritance from their parents. In this case, other relatives (like brothers, nephews etc.) will take control of the whole wealth and inheritance, while the adopted children will get nothing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human Psychology: No natural bond will be created even by suckling MILK to an adult man with a beard, except for the bond of LUST&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam has a strange ruling i.e. if a woman suckles an adult man with a beard with her milk, then he becomes her adopted child and they become Mahram and could stay alone under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5064&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 5064:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'A'isha reported that Sahla bint Suhail came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, I see on the face of (my husband) Abu Hudhaifa (signs of disgust) on entering of Salim (who is an ally) into (our house), whereupon Allah's Apostle said: Suckle him. She said: How can I suckle him as he is a grown-up man? Allah's Messenger smiled and said: I already know that he is a young man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Rationale clearly guides us that this Islamic Ruling is full of fault (ridiculously faulty), while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chances of fostering milk to an adult man will not produce the natural bond of mother/son between them, but thousands of times more chances are there, that it will create the bond of a LUST only. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, there could be a bond of respect between a young woman and a young man, but fostering him with a woman’s milk is the worst method of achieving this respect. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if a woman takes care of the younger brother of her husband, and behaves with him like her own real younger brother, then it will automatically create a relationship of “respect” between them. That is why, in millions of Muslim households in Pakistan and India, they are living together in a joint family system. But Islam denies this bond of respect between a woman and her brother-in-law, and considers it to be a cause of fornication. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam apologists present the following lame excuse here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists are dishonest. The Prophet didn’t tell that woman to foster her milk to that adult man with a beard directly from her breasts, but from the cup (i.e. she pumps out her milk in a cup and then gives it to that adult man with beard to drink).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this excuse has nothing to do with our present topic, which is limited only to the comparison of how Islam denies the bond between the mother and the adopted children, but it considers that natural bond of motherhood to be created if a woman fosters her milk to an adult man with a beard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if it was not about feeding him her milk directly from the breasts, but only about pumping the milk in the cup, why did the prophet “smile”? And why did she ask this question about how she could suckle a grown-up man? This question from her, and the “smiling” of the prophet is proof enough that Muhammad was telling her to suckle him directly from her breasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strange Islam: An adult Slave automatically becomes Mahram to the woman, but not her adopted son&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contradictions !!! Contradictions !!! Contradictions !!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Islam rejected the natural bond between the mother and the adopted son, and they could not stay under one roof except for fitna of fornication, but on the other hand, it claims if she (or her husband) buys an adult slave, then he automatically immediately becomes a Mahram to her, and both of them could stay alone under one roof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.31&quot;&gt;24:31&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their head covers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess (i.e. slaves)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.58&quot;&gt;24:58&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands possess (i.e. slaves) and those who have not [yet] reached puberty among you (i.e. children) ask permission of you [before entering in your rooms] at three times: before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing [for rest] at noon and after the night prayer. [These are] three times of privacy for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see the following tradition, where Muhammad was telling her daughter Fatima that she didn’t need to take a Hijab in front of her slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4106&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 4106&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;br&gt;Narrated Anas ibn Malik: The Prophet brought Fatimah a slave which he donated to her. Fatimah wore a garment which, when she covered her head, did not reach her feet, and when she covered her feet by it, that garment did not reach her head. When the Prophet saw her struggle, he said: There is no harm to you: Here is only your father and slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no Islamic Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making these revelations at his own, therefore we see the colour of “human mistakes” in form of clear Contradictions in the Sharia rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic Logic: Brother-in-law is ahead of all others in fornication with the wife of his brother&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Islam, the brother-in-law, who grew up the whole of his life along with his brother, will be ahead of all others when it comes to fornication with his brother’s wife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5232&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5232&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2172a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith2172a&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;br&gt;Uqba b. `Amir reported Allah's Messenger as saying: Beware of getting into the houses and meeting women (in seclusion). A person from the Ansar said: Allah's Messenger, what about husband's brother, whereupon he said: Husband's brother is like death (i.e. he will be ahead of all others in indulging in fornication with her sister-in-law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Rationale and the humanity within us guide us clearly that a man, who grew along with his brother and loves him, will protect the honour of his brother as compared to any other outsider man, even if he is a slave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the inventor of Islam (i.e. Muhammad himself) didn’t even consider the slaves to be a human, but only animals. And as the pet animals are unable to do fornication with their mistresses, in the same way, slaves are also unable to do fornication with their mistresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see these strange contradictions in Islam where a slave automatically becomes immediately a Mahram for a woman, but the brother-in-law is considered the most dangerous person for involvement in fornication with her? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who live in human societies also respect human bonds too. Millions of Muslim families themselves live in joint family systems in Pakistan/India/Bangladesh, and it is proof enough that this Islamic ruling is totally wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see these contradictions in Islam, while it is neither a religion of Nature, nor a religion of humanity, but it is only a “human Drama of revelation”, and there is no divine God present in the heavens. That is why it is full of “human mistakes”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Chinese man adopted an orphaned Afghan girl, but the reactions from Islamists are shocking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think the reactions of Islamists would be? It’s disheartening to witness such a mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out their reactions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1dyzvuk/this_afghani_girl_became_an_orphan_during_the/&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Islam made it Halal for the foster Muslim father to marry his minor adopted (orphan) daughter by force (without even her consent) if he got a desire for her due to her beauty:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.3&quot;&gt;4:3&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Muhammad was forced to claim the revelation of this verse? The following tradition of ‘Aisha makes it clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5064&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5064&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;('Urwa narrated from ‘Aisha that she said about this verse 4:3) &quot;O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her &lt;strong&gt;wealth and beauty&lt;/strong&gt; and intends to marry her with a Mahr (i.e. money for dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr (i.e. Dowry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=127&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَيَسْتَفْتُونَكَ فِي النِّسَاءِ قُلِ اللّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِيهِنَّ وَمَا يُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الْكِتَابِ فِي يَتَامَى النِّسَاءِ الَّاتِي لاَ تُؤْتُونَهُنَّ مَا كُتِبَ لَهُنَّ وَتَرْغَبُونَ أَن تَنكِحُوهُنَّ وَالْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الْوِلْدَانِ وَأَن تَقُومُواْ لِلْيَتَامَى بِالْقِسْطِ وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ بِهِ عَلِيمًا&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned girls (in your charge) to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage, as well as in respect of helpless (male) children (الْوِلْدَانِ children: genitive masculine plural noun), that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reason that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no more considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic website IslamQA writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse (i.e. Quran 4:3) proves it’s allowed (for a foster father) to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;This shows it’s allowed (for a foster father) to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident of the marriage of Muhammad with the ex-wife of his adopted son was later used by one greedy Sahabi (companion of Muhammad) who got a lust for her minor adopted daughter due to her beauty and her wealth, and he took her into her Nikah by force. (Note: No foster mother, and no Islamic court, is able to stop the Muslim foster father to marry his minor adopted daughter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it seems that the Arab Society (which Islam and Muslims blame to be from the time of Ignorance) protested against it, as they had already protested in the case of Muhammad when he first wished to marry his daughter-in-law. Moreover, that greedy companion also wished to loot that little orphan girl by giving less money as dowry, and secondly, to take complete control of her wealth as her husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, no one was able to stop that companion directly, as Muhammad had already set complete precedence himself for this before, by committing two actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, Muhammad did Nikah with 6 years old minor ‘Aisha, and her father Abu Bakr didn’t need any consent from little ‘Aisha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, Muhammad had destroyed the bond between the adopted children and the foster parents and had married his own daughter-in-law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, despite the protest, Muhammad didn’t stop him or punish him from taking the minor adopted daughter into his Nikah, but in order to avoid criticism, he only asked him to pay the full money for the dowry, and he also tried to lure his companion by inviting him to marry 2 or 3 or 4 of others women, who pleased him, but to leave the orphan girl apart if he fears to not to do justice with her wealth (i.e. due to money for a dowry, or due to taking full control over her wealth). Nevertheless, this was also only a “recommendation” and if a greedy Muslim foster father still wishes to marry the minor adopted daughter in order to take full control over her wealth, then NO Islamic Court could stop him from doing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Natural Bond between parents and adopted children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child does not care who gave birth to him, but he will go towards the one who fosters him, who loves him, and who takes care of him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, when a woman or a man fosters a child, then a natural bond is created between them. In the whole world, in each and every nation, all the modern psychiatrists accept this natural bond, except Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “bond of fostering” is stronger than the “bond of blood”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing exists even among animals too. If you keep the eggs of duck under the hen, then the ducklings will consider that hen to be their mother and follow her while she takes care of them. Even if a cat takes care of ducklings, then they will consider that cat to be their mother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The status of the one who fosters the child is HIGHER than the status of the one who gave birth to the child.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Fatwa: Adopted son should be separated from his mother after becoming an adult&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see more cruelty of this Islamic ruling, then look at this fatwa (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.banuri.edu.pk/readquestion/mun-bole-betay-se-parde-ka-hukum/01-01-2010&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), where a Muslim mother was crying and refused to be separated from her adopted son (while he became an adult at age of 12-13 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the relatives wanted to forcefully separate them (i.e. the mother and the adopted child) from each other, and the Muslim Mufti supported the action of the relatives while it is indeed the order of Allah in Islam, as Allah fears that it will cause the Fitna of fornication if both Na-Mahrams (i.e. mother and her 12-14 years old adopted son) stay together under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islam snatched away the right to have any FAMILY from an orphan child&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only an adopted male child is separated from his mother (after becoming an adult), but he is also separated from his sisters too, while they are also counted as Na-Mahrams. He is kicked out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the case of an orphan girl is even worse. She is not only a Na-Mahram to her brothers, but also to her father right from the beginning. Not only could her father look at her with lust right from the beginning, but also her brothers could also look at her with lust right from the beginning (i.e. they never look at her as a daughter or a sister, but as a sexual object right from the beginning). In simple words, Islam snatched away the right to have any family from poor orphan children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PS: Islam also denied the orphan children any inheritance from their parents. In this case, other relatives (like brothers, nephews etc.) will take control of the whole wealth and inheritance, while the adopted children will get nothing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human Psychology: No natural bond will be created even by suckling MILK to an adult man with a beard, except for the bond of LUST&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam has a strange ruling i.e. if a woman suckles an adult man with a beard with her milk, then he becomes her adopted child and they become Mahram and could stay alone under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5064&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 5064:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'A'isha reported that Sahla bint Suhail came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, I see on the face of (my husband) Abu Hudhaifa (signs of disgust) on entering of Salim (who is an ally) into (our house), whereupon Allah's Apostle said: Suckle him. She said: How can I suckle him as he is a grown-up man? Allah's Messenger smiled and said: I already know that he is a young man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Rationale clearly guides us that this Islamic Ruling is full of fault (ridiculously faulty), while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chances of fostering milk to an adult man will not produce the natural bond of mother/son between them, but thousands of times more chances are there, that it will create the bond of a LUST only. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, there could be a bond of respect between a young woman and a young man, but fostering him with a woman’s milk is the worst method of achieving this respect. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if a woman takes care of the younger brother of her husband, and behaves with him like her own real younger brother, then it will automatically create a relationship of “respect” between them. That is why, in millions of Muslim households in Pakistan and India, they are living together in a joint family system. But Islam denies this bond of respect between a woman and her brother-in-law, and considers it to be a cause of fornication. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this excuse has nothing to do with our present topic, which is limited only to the comparison of how Islam denies the bond between the mother and the adopted children, but it considers that natural bond of motherhood to be created if a woman fosters her milk to an adult man with a beard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if it was not about feeding him her milk directly from the breasts, but only about pumping the milk in the cup, why did the prophet “smile”? And why did she ask this question about how she could suckle a grown-up man? This question from her, and the “smiling” of the prophet is proof enough that Muhammad was telling her to suckle him directly from her breasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strange Islam: An adult Slave automatically becomes Mahram to the woman, but not her adopted son&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contradictions !!! Contradictions !!! Contradictions !!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Islam rejected the natural bond between the mother and the adopted son, and they could not stay under one roof except for fitna of fornication, but on the other hand, it claims if she (or her husband) buys an adult slave, then he automatically immediately becomes a Mahram to her, and both of them could stay alone under one roof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.31&quot;&gt;24:31&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their head covers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess (i.e. slaves)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/24.58&quot;&gt;24:58&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands possess (i.e. slaves) and those who have not [yet] reached puberty among you (i.e. children) ask permission of you [before entering in your rooms] at three times: before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing [for rest] at noon and after the night prayer. [These are] three times of privacy for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see the following tradition, where Muhammad was telling her daughter Fatima that she didn’t need to take a Hijab in front of her slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4106&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 4106&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;br&gt;Narrated Anas ibn Malik: The Prophet brought Fatimah a slave which he donated to her. Fatimah wore a garment which, when she covered her head, did not reach her feet, and when she covered her feet by it, that garment did not reach her head. When the Prophet saw her struggle, he said: There is no harm to you: Here is only your father and slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no Islamic Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was making these revelations at his own, therefore we see the colour of “human mistakes” in form of clear Contradictions in the Sharia rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic Logic: Brother-in-law is ahead of all others in fornication with the wife of his brother&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Islam, the brother-in-law, who grew up the whole of his life along with his brother, will be ahead of all others when it comes to fornication with his brother’s wife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5232&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 5232&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2172a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith2172a&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;br&gt;Uqba b. `Amir reported Allah's Messenger as saying: Beware of getting into the houses and meeting women (in seclusion). A person from the Ansar said: Allah's Messenger, what about husband's brother, whereupon he said: Husband's brother is like death (i.e. he will be ahead of all others in indulging in fornication with her sister-in-law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Rationale and the humanity within us guide us clearly that a man, who grew along with his brother and loves him, will protect the honour of his brother as compared to any other outsider man, even if he is a slave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the inventor of Islam (i.e. Muhammad himself) didn’t even consider the slaves to be a human, but only animals. And as the pet animals are unable to do fornication with their mistresses, in the same way, slaves are also unable to do fornication with their mistresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to see these strange contradictions in Islam where a slave automatically becomes immediately a Mahram for a woman, but the brother-in-law is considered the most dangerous person for involvement in fornication with her? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who live in human societies also respect human bonds too. Millions of Muslim families themselves live in joint family systems in Pakistan/India/Bangladesh, and it is proof enough that this Islamic ruling is totally wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see these contradictions in Islam, while it is neither a religion of Nature, nor a religion of humanity, but it is only a “human Drama of revelation”, and there is no divine God present in the heavens. That is why it is full of “human mistakes”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Chinese man adopted an orphaned Afghan girl, but the reactions from Islamists are shocking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think the reactions of Islamists would be? It’s disheartening to witness such a mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out their reactions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1dyzvuk/this_afghani_girl_became_an_orphan_during_the/&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Poor small girls had &lt;strong&gt;No Choice&lt;/strong&gt;, as Islam allowed their fathers/guardians to wed them even without their consent &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=71&amp;amp;catid=27&quot;&gt;(link).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abu Bakr didn't ask for any consent from 'Aisha at the age of 6 years when she was married. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, those 9-year-old brides (or younger) had no choice. They were wed, and they were FORCED to give birth to babies at that age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us look at the extreme dangers and harms to 9 years old mothers and their babies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Extreme Dangers&lt;/span&gt; for teen mothers and their babies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;1. Science says 25-30 is the age of least risk to mother and child for a first pregnancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;With the onset of puberty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory essentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology around the age of 25–30 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2. The younger the mother, the greater the risk. Childbearing in adolescents aged 12–15 years in low resource countries: a neglected issue. New estimates from demographic and household surveys in 42 countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;It is frequently cited that girls who give birth aged 15–19 are more than twice as likely to die as those in their 20s (1, 2). However, this fails to capture the fact that risk increases with decreasing age. ......girls aged 15 or under had an odds ratio for maternal death four times higher than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;3. It is not just mortality, it's fistulas. Science says it is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;4. Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The women and girls who do survive often develop fistulas, which are holes between the vaginal wall and the rectum or bladder. When the baby's head pushes down and gets stuck, it can cut portions of the mother's soft tissue between its skull and her pelvic bones. As a result, the tissue dies, and a hole forms. Faeces and urine then leak through the hole and out of the vagina. Women with fistulas are often divorced and shunned. And young girls are at higher risk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Children of teen mothers suffer dreadful health problems &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;their entire life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #f8cac6;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The high mortality rate among children born to teen mothers is not the only issue; these children also endure other dreadful health problems throughout their entire lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children of teen mothers are at higher risk of intellectual, language, and socio-emotional delays.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Day_2009_30-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Day_2009-30&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Developmental disability&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability&quot;&gt;Developmental disabilities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Behavior&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior&quot;&gt;behavioral&lt;/a&gt; issues are increased in children born to teen mothers.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-34&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-34&quot;&gt;[34]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One study suggested that adolescent mothers are less likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Stimulation&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation&quot;&gt;stimulate&lt;/a&gt; their infant through &lt;a title=&quot;Affection&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection&quot;&gt;affectionate behaviors&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a title=&quot;Haptic communication&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_communication&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Smile&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile&quot;&gt;smiling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&quot;Linguistics&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics&quot;&gt;verbal communication&lt;/a&gt;, or to be &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sensitivity (human)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_(human)&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Acceptance&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance&quot;&gt;accepting&lt;/a&gt; toward their needs.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Grade (education)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)&quot;&gt;academic performance&lt;/a&gt; in the children of teenage mothers has also been noted, with many of the children being held back a grade level, scoring lower on standardized tests, and/or failing to graduate from secondary school.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-natcamp_26-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-natcamp-26&quot;&gt;[26]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Sentence (law)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)&quot;&gt;serve time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title=&quot;Prison&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-37&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-37&quot;&gt;[37]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; color: #ff0000; background-color: #f8cac6;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is all this Data Islamophobic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Even early pregnancy of cattle is also not recommended&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In livestock the rule of thumb is to start breeding at 150%-200% of the age of onset of menarche. Islam is just wrong in setting it at any age when the guardian thinks the girl will be OK having intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goats:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.boergoatprofitsguide.com/goat-breeding-age-whats-the-best-age/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.boergoatprofitsguide.com/goat-breeding-age-whats-the-best-age/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;“Boer does can be bred at 6 months. However, breeding the does before they reach the proper weight (generally around 80 pounds) can stunt their growth and lead to reproductive problems. A common age for breeding is between 10 and 12 months.Having does reproduce too early can lead to pregnancy or birth difficulties. The most common complication of a young doe giving birth is that of an abnormally positioned kid. This can lead to the death of both the kid and the doe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cows/oxen:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;Usually it's best to wait until they are at least 15 months of age before breeding. Even though the early maturing breeds do reach puberty by the time they are around 7 to 9 months of age, it is best to wait until they are around 13 to 15 months of age before you can breed them.\[1\] This is because it allows them to grow more, increase their pelvic area and gain enough condition that can allow them to sustain themselves throughout gestation. Heifers that are bred too early tend to have too small a pelvic area to calve out,&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;4. Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The women and girls who do survive often develop fistulas, which are holes between the vaginal wall and the rectum or bladder. When the baby's head pushes down and gets stuck, it can cut portions of the mother's soft tissue between its skull and her pelvic bones. As a result, the tissue dies, and a hole forms. Faeces and urine then leak through the hole and out of the vagina. Women with fistulas are often divorced and shunned. And young girls are at higher risk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Children of teen mothers suffer dreadful health problems &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;their entire life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; background-color: #f8cac6;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The high mortality rate among children born to teen mothers is not the only issue; these children also endure other dreadful health problems throughout their entire lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children of teen mothers are at higher risk of intellectual, language, and socio-emotional delays.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Day_2009_30-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Day_2009-30&quot;&gt;[30]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;One study suggested that adolescent mothers are less likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Stimulation&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation&quot;&gt;stimulate&lt;/a&gt; their infant through &lt;a title=&quot;Affection&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection&quot;&gt;affectionate behaviors&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a title=&quot;Haptic communication&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_communication&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;Smile&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile&quot;&gt;smiling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&quot;Linguistics&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics&quot;&gt;verbal communication&lt;/a&gt;, or to be &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sensitivity (human)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_(human)&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Acceptance&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance&quot;&gt;accepting&lt;/a&gt; toward their needs.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-aap_33-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-aap-33&quot;&gt;[33]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Grade (education)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)&quot;&gt;academic performance&lt;/a&gt; in the children of teenage mothers has also been noted, with many of the children being held back a grade level, scoring lower on standardized tests, and/or failing to graduate from secondary school.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-natcamp_26-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-natcamp-26&quot;&gt;[26]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Sentence (law)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)&quot;&gt;serve time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title=&quot;Prison&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-37&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-37&quot;&gt;[37]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Even early pregnancy of cattle is also not recommended&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In livestock the rule of thumb is to start breeding at 150%-200% of the age of onset of menarche. Islam is just wrong in setting it at any age when the guardian thinks the girl will be OK having intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;“Boer does can be bred at 6 months. However, breeding the does before they reach the proper weight (generally around 80 pounds) can stunt their growth and lead to reproductive problems. A common age for breeding is between 10 and 12 months.Having does reproduce too early can lead to pregnancy or birth difficulties. The most common complication of a young doe giving birth is that of an abnormally positioned kid. This can lead to the death of both the kid and the doe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;Usually it's best to wait until they are at least 15 months of age before breeding. Even though the early maturing breeds do reach puberty by the time they are around 7 to 9 months of age, it is best to wait until they are around 13 to 15 months of age before you can breed them.\[1\] This is because it allows them to grow more, increase their pelvic area and gain enough condition that can allow them to sustain themselves throughout gestation. Heifers that are bred too early tend to have too small a pelvic area to calve out,&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;Muslim Apologists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://muslimskeptic.com/author/drjou/&quot;&gt;Daniel Haquiqajou&lt;/a&gt; come up with excuses like (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Video link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marriage and sex with 9 years old pre-pubescent girl was a 'tradition' of that era. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vast majority of history, life expectancy was relatively low. Moreover, infant mortality was considerably high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, it was then necessary to use the extent of the 'fertility window' for reproduction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is why Islam didn't prohibit this practice, but the prophet Muhammad himself married a 9 years old 'Aisha. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam let even a breastfed girl be wed and used as a sex object. This has absolutely nothing to do with the excuse of “reproduction” that Islam apologists like Daniel Haquiqajou make. This Islamic ruling is purely for the benefit and pleasure of old men, while Islam didn't respect the rights of girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;'Aisha was wed to Muhammad at the age of 6 years when she was not even able to give her consent. Yes, Abu Bakr didn't have to ask her about her consent, but he directly married her to Muhammad. Later, at the age of 9 years, she was sent to Muhammad's home for the consummation of the marriage. But it is not necessary for Islamic Sharia to wait till the age of 9 years to send the minor girl to her husband's house, but she could be sent to him even if she is a breastfed baby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Actually, Muslim men were buying small slave child-girls from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, and then using them for sexual pleasures. It happened due to another evil of Islamic slavery, where Islam allowed the owners to separate the children from their slave parents, and sell them in the Bazaars of slavery when they got 2 teeth (i.e. at the age of 6 months). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, there are authentic reports that companions of Muhammad not only used to rape captive women, but also captive pre-pubescent minor girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism, and wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1799_%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%AC-%D9%A8/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_53&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself. As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read our detailed article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=71&amp;amp;catid=27&quot;&gt;Islam: Even a breastfed baby Girl can be married and used for sexual pleasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Furthermore,&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; Human nature dictates that as boys and girls reach adulthood, they naturally experience feelings of love. However, Islam denies girls the right to freely fall in love with a boy of their choice. They can be married off to older men, depriving them of the opportunity to develop natural affection for someone their age. If they dare to follow their heart and develop feelings for a boy of their choice, they may face severe consequences such as beatings or even death, all in the name of terms like modesty, decency, adultery, or Ghairah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000dff;&quot;&gt;Extreme Dangers&lt;/span&gt; for teen mothers and their babies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;1. Science says 25-30 is the age of least risk to mother and child for a first pregnancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;With the onset of puberty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory essentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology around the age of 25–30 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2.. The younger the mother, the greater the risk. Childbearing in adolescents aged 12–15 years in low resource countries: a neglected issue. New estimates from demographic and household surveys in 42 countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;It is frequently cited that girls who give birth aged 15–19 are more than twice as likely to die as those in their 20s (1, 2). However, this fails to capture the fact that risk increases with decreasing age. ......girls aged 15 or under had an odds ratio for maternal death four times higher than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;3. It is not just mortality, it's fistulas. Science says it is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;4. Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The women and girls who do survive often develop fistulas, which are holes between the vaginal wall and the rectum or bladder. When the baby's head pushes down and gets stuck, it can cut portions of the mother's soft tissue between its skull and her pelvic bones. As a result, the tissue dies, and a hole forms. Faeces and urine then leak through the hole and out of the vagina. Women with fistulas are often divorced and shunned. And young girls are at higher risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0006ff;&quot;&gt;Even if they survive&lt;/span&gt;, still the Children of teen mothers suffer &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;dreadful health problems their entire life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;High mortality rate among babies from teen mothers is not the only problem, they also suffer from other horrific health problems too their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant.

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Intense opposition to the marriage of young girls is brought in the name of R. Shimon bar Yohai, that “Whoever marries off his daughter when she is young minimizes the bearing of children and loses his money and comes to bloodshed.”5 5.

&lt;p&gt;500 years before Muhammed, doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soranus_of_Ephesus&quot;&gt;Soranus&lt;/a&gt; wrote his book about gynaecology and in hit he stated that women could be considered fit for conception from 15. 15 is significantly older than 9. Soranus was from Ephesos and worked in Alexandria before he moved to Rome. So he had met desert-conditions girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soranus wrote in his book of gynaecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/book/2189958/9b5cce/soranus-gynecology.html&quot;&gt;Soranus, Of Ephesus and Owsei Temkin (1994) &lt;em&gt;Soranus’ gynecology&lt;/em&gt;. Baltimore Johns Hopkins Univ. Press.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 233):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book about gynecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &quot;For it obtains whenever women married before maturity conceive and give birth while the uterus has not yet fully grown nor the fundus of (the) uterus expanded.&quot; So they knew the pelvic floor and birth canal were not mature enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 227)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... difficult labor occur in those who give birth in a way which is contrary to nature? Diocles the Caerystan in the second book on gynecology says that primiparae and young women have difficult labor&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Recognize Those Capable of Conception:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since women usually are married for the sake of children and succession and not for mere enjoyment and since it is utterly absurd to make inquiries about the excellence of their lineage and the abundance of their means but to leave unexamined whether they can conceive or not and whether they are fit for childbearing or not it is only right for us to give an account of the matter in question One must judge the majority from the ages of 15 to 40 to be fit for conception&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here was the law in the Roman Empire before Muhammad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/146/abstract/roman-law-and-marriage-underage-girls&quot;&gt;Roman Law and the Marriage of Underage Girls&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;Twelve will seem to us undesirably young, and indeed ancient doctors such as Soranus warned against the dangers of women becoming sexually active at so early an age. Most Roman women appear to have married later, from about 15 to 20. But the possibility of efarlier marriage we know to have been actively pursued especially in upper-class families, where marriage often assisted dynastic alliances.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Sparta:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In fact, Sparta raised the marriage age from 18 to 20 with the primary aim of decreasing the number of sickly children. As a result, they observed an increase in life expectancy for women, which began to rival that of men. It became evident that child marriage was the main contributing factor to mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While Athenian women might have expected to marry for the first time around the &lt;strong&gt;age of fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; to men much older than them, Spartan women normally married between the ages of eighteen and twenty to men close to them in age.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-FOOTNOTECartledge198194–95_29-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTECartledge198194%E2%80%9395-29&quot;&gt;[29]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Spartan ideology, the primary role of adult women was to bear and raise healthy children. This focus on childbearing was likely responsible for the emphasis on physical fitness in Spartan women, as it was believed that physically stronger women would have healthier children.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlundell1995157-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bearing and raising children was considered the most important role for women in Spartan society; equal to male warriors in the Spartan army.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-50&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-50&quot;&gt;[50]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Spartan women were encouraged to produce many children, preferably male, to increase Sparta's military population. They took pride in having borne and raised brave warriors.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-51&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-51&quot;&gt;[51]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hence, even with an emphasis on bearing numerous children, Sparta raised the age of marriage for women to 18–20 years. Interestingly, this decision did not hinder Spartan women from having many children. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in the mortality rate among both mothers and children. Additionally, this measure curbed the birth of weak offspring prone to diseases. As a result, only healthy and robust children were born, growing up to become outstanding warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&quot;text-24 xs:text-20&quot;&gt;Laws at the time of Muhammed.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two dominant neighbouring empires had already prohibited intercourse with 9 years old girls before Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ijtihadnet.com/wp-content/uploads/Minor-Marriage-in-Early-Islamic-Law.pdf&quot;&gt; Laws at the time of Muhammed Minor Marriage in Early Islamic Law, Carolyn G. Baugh, LEIDEN | BOSTON, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although investigation into Sasanian-era (224â€“651 CE) child marriage prac-tices unearths scant information, the age of twelve is again important for girls. According to the Avesta, the age of majority was clearly set at fifteen for boys as well as girls; Middle Persian civil law allowed marriage at age nine, provided that consummation wait until age twelve.[24]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byzantine law required that a girl attain the age of thirteen before contract-ing a marriage. Whether she would have consented to the marriage or not prior to this age is deemed immaterial as she would have no legally viable consent to give.[22] All parties to a marriage needed to issue consent, including the groom, the bride, and her parents. In cases where a girl consented to intercourse prior to marriage it was assumed that she consented to the marriage itself and the families would then arrange it. However, if that intercourse occurred prior to the age of thirteen, the groom would meet with the law’s most serious punish-ments due to the girl’s assumed legal inability to consent.[23]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Muhammed it was known to be injurious to girls to engage in very early intercourse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Consequences of Child Marriage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modem Medicine shows that childbirth for females below the age of seventeen and â€¢ above forty leads to &lt;strong&gt;greater maternal mortality as well as infant mortality&lt;/strong&gt; (London  1992, 501). It must he made clear that although conditions commonly associated with poverty, e.g. malnutrition, poor physical health and other negative circumstances may contribute to difficult births and bad health for young mothers, consistent findings indicate that the age factor plays a significant role by itself. &quot;Even under the best of modern conditions, women who give birth before the age of seventeen have a higher mortality rate than older women. The closer a woman is to menarche, &lt;strong&gt;the greater the risk to both mother and child, as well as to the mother's future child bearing capabilities, for the reproductive system has not completely matured when ovulation begins&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. (Demand 1994, 102).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem seen more often among underprivileged women is that they develop **fistulae which is often due to the pelvis not having fully formed. This can be caused by a complicated pregnancy or having intercourse at a very young age.**28. This leads the girl or woman to have permanent damage and often she is shunned by her family and community (4). Although such a condition is preventable it requires a good health service and communications systems (S). Unfortunately, these are often not available in impoverished areas of the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge of medical complications involved with early marriage cannot be considered &quot;new&quot; findings. Ancient and Medieval Medicine texts indicate that doctors were well aware of the physical harm posed to girls by early marriages and pregnancies&lt;/strong&gt;. â€¦â€¦..In fact, not only doctors of Medicine but other scholars in Most societies had a clear understanding that intercourse should not take place before the menarche. &lt;strong&gt;Hesiod suggested marriage in the fifth year after puberty, or age nineteen, and Plato in the Laws mandated from sixteen to twenty years of age, and in the Republic he gave the age as twenty. Aristotle specifically warned against early childbearing for women as a cause of small and weak infants and difficult and dangerous labor for the mother, and the Spartans avoided it for just those reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; (Demand 1994, 102)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)” is supposedly accepted and safe&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Then Muslim preacher Daniel mentions “evolutionary adaptive”, and claims that academics agree with him that “Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)” is supposedly accepted and safe. And as proof, he put the “Bruce Rind Study”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But it was again a deception by Daniel on many accounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Rind Study was not about the reproduction of children, which is the main argument by Muslims for early marriages of prepubescent girls in order to defend Islam. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Rind Study was only limited to 'long term effects' upon children, who were raped. It concluded that there were no significant long-term effects found in children, who were abused. But this rape was mostly a one-time phenomenon, and not living constantly in such a situation, as it happens in a husband-wife relationship. Those children grew up, found their love and partners, married, and led family life etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This study does not deny the short-term traumas of these children. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Whether it is a rape of adult women, or of children, it stays a crime. It does not become permissible while one study didn't find long-term effects due to rape. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it was a complete absence of Academic Integrity from Daniel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He does not think his audience deserves to know that his source is highly controversial. The Rind is one of the most controversial papers ever. (Link: &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also omits that Rind et al stated that CSA (Child Sexual Abuse) should remain criminalized, which is irreconcilable with Daniel claiming that CSA is supposedly acceptable and safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. study has been criticized by many scientists and researchers, on the grounds that its &lt;a title=&quot;Methodology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology&quot;&gt;methodology&lt;/a&gt; and conclusions are poorly designed and statistically flawed.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Glicken_4-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Glicken-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Rosenthal_5-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Rosenthal-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-McCoy_6-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-McCoy-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Its definition of &lt;i&gt;harm&lt;/i&gt;, for example, has been the subject of debate, as it only examined self-reported long-term psychological effects in young adults. In contrast, harm can have several forms, including short-term or medical harm (for example, &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sexually transmitted disease&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease&quot;&gt;sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt; or injuries), a likelihood of revictimization, and the amount of time the victim spent attending &lt;a title=&quot;Therapy&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy&quot;&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; for the abuse.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-McCoy_6-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-McCoy-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Numerous studies and professional clinical experience in the field of psychology, both before and after Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.'s publications, have long borne out that children cannot consent to sexual activity and that child and adolescent sexual abuse cause harm.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dallam2001_7-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Dallam2001-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dallam_8-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Dallam-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Salter_9-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Salter-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Psychologist &lt;a title=&quot;Anna Salter&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Salter&quot;&gt;Anna Salter&lt;/a&gt; comments that Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.'s results are “truly an outlier” compared to other meta-analyses.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Salter_9-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Salter-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel also defended that women should not be given Equal Rights, as it will destroy society. Please read our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/women-general/171-patriarchy-argument-from-muslim-preachers-why-women-should-not-be-given-equal-rights-and-must-be-kept-under-men&quot;&gt;Patriarchy: Argument from Muslim Preachers why women should not be given EQUAL Rights and must be kept under men.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;div&gt;Muslim Apologists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://muslimskeptic.com/author/drjou/&quot;&gt;Daniel Haquiqajou&lt;/a&gt; come up with excuses like (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El13YXwRDM&amp;amp;t=2753s&quot;&gt;Video link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marriage and sex with 9 years old pre-pubescent girl was a 'tradition' of that era. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vast majority of history, life expectancy was relatively low. Moreover, infant mortality was considerably high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, it was then necessary to use the extent of the 'fertility window' for reproduction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is why Islam didn't prohibit this practice, but the prophet Muhammad himself married a 9 years old 'Aisha. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islam let even a breastfed girl be wed and used as a sex object. This has absolutely nothing to do with the excuse of “reproduction” that Islam apologists like Daniel Haquiqajou make. This Islamic ruling is purely for the benefit and pleasure of old men, while Islam didn't respect the rights of girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;'Aisha was wed to Muhammad at the age of 6 years when she was not even able to give her consent. Yes, Abu Bakr didn't have to ask her about her consent, but he directly married her to Muhammad. Later, at the age of 9 years, she was sent to Muhammad's home for the consummation of the marriage. But it is not necessary for Islamic Sharia to wait till the age of 9 years to send the minor girl to her husband's house, but she could be sent to him even if she is a breastfed baby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Actually, Muslim men were buying small slave child-girls from the Islamic Bazaars of slavery, and then using them for sexual pleasures. It happened due to another evil of Islamic slavery, where Islam allowed the owners to separate the children from their slave parents, and sell them in the Bazaars of slavery when they got 2 teeth (i.e. at the age of 6 months). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Moreover, there are authentic reports that companions of Muhammad not only used to rape captive women, but also captive pre-pubescent minor girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Ali raped that captive girl the same night without any&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, thus some people criticized this action of Ali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism, and wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/1799_%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%AC-%D9%A8/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_53&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself. As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Please read our detailed article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=71&amp;amp;catid=27&quot;&gt;Islam: Even a breastfed baby Girl can be married and used for sexual pleasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Furthermore,&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; Human nature dictates that as boys and girls reach adulthood, they naturally experience feelings of love. However, Islam denies girls the right to freely fall in love with a boy of their choice. They can be married off to older men, depriving them of the opportunity to develop natural affection for someone their age. If they dare to follow their heart and develop feelings for a boy of their choice, they may face severe consequences such as beatings or even death, all in the name of terms like modesty, decency, adultery, or Ghairah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000dff;&quot;&gt;Extreme Dangers&lt;/span&gt; for teen mothers and their babies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;1. Science says 25-30 is the age of least risk to mother and child for a first pregnancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5227&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;With the onset of puberty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory essentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology around the age of 25–30 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2.. The younger the mother, the greater the risk. Childbearing in adolescents aged 12–15 years in low resource countries: a neglected issue. New estimates from demographic and household surveys in 42 countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01467.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;It is frequently cited that girls who give birth aged 15–19 are more than twice as likely to die as those in their 20s (1, 2). However, this fails to capture the fact that risk increases with decreasing age. ......girls aged 15 or under had an odds ratio for maternal death four times higher than women aged 20–24. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;3. It is not just mortality, it's fistulas. Science says it is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877393/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obstetric fistula is very common, as access to and use of emergency obstetric care is limited ...... Several factors have been linked to the high occurrence of obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa, including the preponderance of early marriage and teenage pregnancy, which in turn mean that the girls do not have pelvises which have sufficiently developed to allow reproduction [10]. This is further compounded by the poor nutritional status of most of the girls who live in these highly deprived settings [11,12].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;4. Aid workers confirm death and fistulas are the problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/19584-10-year-birth.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&quot;The greatest danger, however, is to the pelvic floor. Girls may start ovulating and menstruating as early as age 9, though the average is around 12 to 13. ........ Just because a girl can get pregnant, though, doesn't mean she can safely deliver a baby. The pelvis does not fully widen until the late teens, meaning that young girls may not be able to push the baby through the birth canal. The results are horrific, said Wall and Thomas, who have both worked in Africa treating women in the aftermath of such labors. Girls may labor for days; many die. Their babies often don't survive labor either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The women and girls who do survive often develop fistulas, which are holes between the vaginal wall and the rectum or bladder. When the baby's head pushes down and gets stuck, it can cut portions of the mother's soft tissue between its skull and her pelvic bones. As a result, the tissue dies, and a hole forms. Faeces and urine then leak through the hole and out of the vagina. Women with fistulas are often divorced and shunned. And young girls are at higher risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0006ff;&quot;&gt;Even if they survive&lt;/span&gt;, still the Children of teen mothers suffer &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;dreadful health problems their entire life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;High mortality rate among babies from teen mothers is not the only problem, they also suffer from other horrific health problems too their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Early motherhood can affect the &lt;a title=&quot;Developmental psychology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology&quot;&gt;psychosocial development&lt;/a&gt; of the infant. The children of teen mothers are more likely to be born prematurely with a low birth weight, predisposing them to many other lifelong conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Gibbs-2012_32-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Gibbs-2012-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sons born to teenage mothers are three times more likely to &lt;a title=&quot;Sentence (law)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)&quot;&gt;serve time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a title=&quot;Prison&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-37&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-37&quot;&gt;[37]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Intense opposition to the marriage of young girls is brought in the name of R. Shimon bar Yohai, that “Whoever marries off his daughter when she is young minimizes the bearing of children and loses his money and comes to bloodshed.”5 5. Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, Version II, ch. 48, p. 66. The concern is that the young girl may become pregnant and die as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;500 years before Muhammed, doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soranus_of_Ephesus&quot;&gt;Soranus&lt;/a&gt; wrote his book about gynaecology and in hit he stated that women could be considered fit for conception from 15. 15 is significantly older than 9. Soranus was from Ephesos and worked in Alexandria before he moved to Rome. So he had met desert-conditions girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soranus wrote in his book of gynaecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/book/2189958/9b5cce/soranus-gynecology.html&quot;&gt;Soranus, Of Ephesus and Owsei Temkin (1994) &lt;em&gt;Soranus’ gynecology&lt;/em&gt;. Baltimore Johns Hopkins Univ. Press.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 233):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book about gynecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &quot;For it obtains whenever women married before maturity conceive and give birth while the uterus has not yet fully grown nor the fundus of (the) uterus expanded.&quot; So they knew the pelvic floor and birth canal were not mature enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 227)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... difficult labor occur in those who give birth in a way which is contrary to nature? Diocles the Caerystan in the second book on gynecology says that primiparae and young women have difficult labor&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Recognize Those Capable of Conception:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since women usually are married for the sake of children and succession and not for mere enjoyment and since it is utterly absurd to make inquiries about the excellence of their lineage and the abundance of their means but to leave unexamined whether they can conceive or not and whether they are fit for childbearing or not it is only right for us to give an account of the matter in question One must judge the majority from the ages of 15 to 40 to be fit for conception&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here was the law in the Roman Empire before Muhammad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/146/abstract/roman-law-and-marriage-underage-girls&quot;&gt;Roman Law and the Marriage of Underage Girls&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;Twelve will seem to us undesirably young, and indeed ancient doctors such as Soranus warned against the dangers of women becoming sexually active at so early an age. Most Roman women appear to have married later, from about 15 to 20. But the possibility of efarlier marriage we know to have been actively pursued especially in upper-class families, where marriage often assisted dynastic alliances.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Sparta:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In fact, Sparta raised the marriage age from 18 to 20 with the primary aim of decreasing the number of sickly children. As a result, they observed an increase in life expectancy for women, which began to rival that of men. It became evident that child marriage was the main contributing factor to mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While Athenian women might have expected to marry for the first time around the &lt;strong&gt;age of fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; to men much older than them, Spartan women normally married between the ages of eighteen and twenty to men close to them in age.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-FOOTNOTECartledge198194–95_29-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTECartledge198194%E2%80%9395-29&quot;&gt;[29]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Spartan ideology, the primary role of adult women was to bear and raise healthy children. This focus on childbearing was likely responsible for the emphasis on physical fitness in Spartan women, as it was believed that physically stronger women would have healthier children.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlundell1995157-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bearing and raising children was considered the most important role for women in Spartan society; equal to male warriors in the Spartan army.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-50&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-50&quot;&gt;[50]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Spartan women were encouraged to produce many children, preferably male, to increase Sparta's military population. They took pride in having borne and raised brave warriors.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-51&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-51&quot;&gt;[51]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hence, even with an emphasis on bearing numerous children, Sparta raised the age of marriage for women to 18–20 years. Interestingly, this decision did not hinder Spartan women from having many children. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in the mortality rate among both mothers and children. Additionally, this measure curbed the birth of weak offspring prone to diseases. As a result, only healthy and robust children were born, growing up to become outstanding warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although investigation into Sasanian-era (224â€“651 CE) child marriage prac-tices unearths scant information, the age of twelve is again important for girls. According to the Avesta, the age of majority was clearly set at fifteen for boys as well as girls; Middle Persian civil law allowed marriage at age nine, provided that consummation wait until age twelve.[24]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byzantine law required that a girl attain the age of thirteen before contract-ing a marriage. Whether she would have consented to the marriage or not prior to this age is deemed immaterial as she would have no legally viable consent to give.[22] All parties to a marriage needed to issue consent, including the groom, the bride, and her parents. In cases where a girl consented to intercourse prior to marriage it was assumed that she consented to the marriage itself and the families would then arrange it. However, if that intercourse occurred prior to the age of thirteen, the groom would meet with the law’s most serious punish-ments due to the girl’s assumed legal inability to consent.[23]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Muhammed it was known to be injurious to girls to engage in very early intercourse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Consequences of Child Marriage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modem Medicine shows that childbirth for females below the age of seventeen and â€¢ above forty leads to &lt;strong&gt;greater maternal mortality as well as infant mortality&lt;/strong&gt; (London  1992, 501). It must he made clear that although conditions commonly associated with poverty, e.g. malnutrition, poor physical health and other negative circumstances may contribute to difficult births and bad health for young mothers, consistent findings indicate that the age factor plays a significant role by itself. &quot;Even under the best of modern conditions, women who give birth before the age of seventeen have a higher mortality rate than older women. The closer a woman is to menarche, &lt;strong&gt;the greater the risk to both mother and child, as well as to the mother's future child bearing capabilities, for the reproductive system has not completely matured when ovulation begins&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. (Demand 1994, 102).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem seen more often among underprivileged women is that they develop **fistulae which is often due to the pelvis not having fully formed. This can be caused by a complicated pregnancy or having intercourse at a very young age.**28. This leads the girl or woman to have permanent damage and often she is shunned by her family and community (4). Although such a condition is preventable it requires a good health service and communications systems (S). Unfortunately, these are often not available in impoverished areas of the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge of medical complications involved with early marriage cannot be considered &quot;new&quot; findings. Ancient and Medieval Medicine texts indicate that doctors were well aware of the physical harm posed to girls by early marriages and pregnancies&lt;/strong&gt;. â€¦â€¦..In fact, not only doctors of Medicine but other scholars in Most societies had a clear understanding that intercourse should not take place before the menarche. &lt;strong&gt;Hesiod suggested marriage in the fifth year after puberty, or age nineteen, and Plato in the Laws mandated from sixteen to twenty years of age, and in the Republic he gave the age as twenty. Aristotle specifically warned against early childbearing for women as a cause of small and weak infants and difficult and dangerous labor for the mother, and the Spartans avoided it for just those reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; (Demand 1994, 102)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)” is supposedly accepted and safe&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Then Muslim preacher Daniel mentions “evolutionary adaptive”, and claims that academics agree with him that “Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)” is supposedly accepted and safe. And as proof, he put the “Bruce Rind Study”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But it was again a deception by Daniel on many accounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Rind Study was not about the reproduction of children, which is the main argument by Muslims for early marriages of prepubescent girls in order to defend Islam. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Rind Study was only limited to 'long term effects' upon children, who were raped. It concluded that there were no significant long-term effects found in children, who were abused. But this rape was mostly a one-time phenomenon, and not living constantly in such a situation, as it happens in a husband-wife relationship. Those children grew up, found their love and partners, married, and led family life etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This study does not deny the short-term traumas of these children. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Whether it is a rape of adult women, or of children, it stays a crime. It does not become permissible while one study didn't find long-term effects due to rape. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it was a complete absence of Academic Integrity from Daniel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He does not think his audience deserves to know that his source is highly controversial. The Rind is one of the most controversial papers ever. (Link: &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He also omits that Rind et al stated that CSA (Child Sexual Abuse) should remain criminalized, which is irreconcilable with Daniel claiming that CSA is supposedly acceptable and safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. study has been criticized by many scientists and researchers, on the grounds that its &lt;a title=&quot;Methodology&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology&quot;&gt;methodology&lt;/a&gt; and conclusions are poorly designed and statistically flawed.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Glicken_4-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Glicken-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Rosenthal_5-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Rosenthal-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-McCoy_6-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-McCoy-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Its definition of &lt;i&gt;harm&lt;/i&gt;, for example, has been the subject of debate, as it only examined self-reported long-term psychological effects in young adults. In contrast, harm can have several forms, including short-term or medical harm (for example, &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Sexually transmitted disease&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease&quot;&gt;sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt; or injuries), a likelihood of revictimization, and the amount of time the victim spent attending &lt;a title=&quot;Therapy&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy&quot;&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; for the abuse.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-McCoy_6-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-McCoy-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Numerous studies and professional clinical experience in the field of psychology, both before and after Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.'s publications, have long borne out that children cannot consent to sexual activity and that child and adolescent sexual abuse cause harm.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dallam2001_7-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Dallam2001-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Dallam_8-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Dallam-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Salter_9-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Salter-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Psychologist &lt;a title=&quot;Anna Salter&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Salter&quot;&gt;Anna Salter&lt;/a&gt; comments that Rind &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.'s results are “truly an outlier” compared to other meta-analyses.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Salter_9-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rind_et_al._controversy#cite_note-Salter-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Daniel also defended that women should not be given Equal Rights, as it will destroy society.

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was an Ijma (إجماع i.e. CONSENSUS) of Muslim Ummah that marriage with a minor girl is allowed. But in the present century, few modern Muslim Preachers (and Quranists, i.e. those who reject Hadith) have started denying it. They are trying to misuse verse 4:6 as an argument to deny marriage to minor girls in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=6&quot;&gt;4:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;وَٱبْتَلُوا۟&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And test the orphans until when they reached the age of marriage (Nikah), then if you perceive in them sound judgement then deliver to them their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Muslim preachers claim that one gets sound judgement about one's wealth when one is already an adult person. Thus, this means that Islam prescribed that one can marry only after becoming an adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Muslim Fatwa website &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;Islam Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أن الآية الكريمة ليس فيها منع تزويج الصغير أو الصغيرة، ولم تسق لبيان موضوع التزويج، وإنما هي في إيتاء المال لليتامى، وأن ذلك يكون بعد البلوغ،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noble verse does not prohibit the marriage of minors, and it does not provide any clarification regarding the subject of marriage. Rather, it pertains to giving wealth to orphans, indicating that this should occur after they reach puberty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the word &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Nikah&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah&quot;&gt;Nikah&lt;/a&gt; has a double meaning in the Arabic language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the Islamic Sharia, &quot;Nikah&quot; is a terminology, whose meaning in Islamic Sharia is “marriage”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the literal meaning of “Nikah” in the Arabic language is &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;Nikah (Sexual Consummation of Marriage)&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah_%28Sexual_Consummation_of_Marriage%29&quot;&gt;To do Sexual Intercourse&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes even more evident from another verse of Quran 17:34:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.34?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 17:34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ &lt;strong&gt;أَشُدَّهُۥ&lt;/strong&gt; ۚ&lt;br&gt;Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of &lt;strong&gt;full strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word أَشُدَّهُ (full strength) in this verse means the age when young boys and girls start feeling the desire/strength to have sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as Shar'i Nikah (marriage) is concerned, then there is no condition present in it of reaching the أَشُدَّهُ (i.e. Full Strength to do the act of intercourse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proof is that prophet Muhammad himself did the Shar'i Nikah with 'Aisha when she was only 6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And no one tests a 6-year-old child for handing over his/her property to him/her, as a 6-year-old child has neither أَشُدَّهُ (Strength/Desire) nor he/she has any kind of “sound judgement” to look after his/her property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Shar'i Nikah has nothing to do with the أَشُدَّهُ (strength), as Muhammad did this Shar'i Nikah with 6 years 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, even at the age of 9, when 'Aisha finally came to the house of Muhammad for the consummation of marriage, she was still not mentally sound enough to look after any property or business. It is evident from the following hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-6130/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 6130:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, according to Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a girl reaches puberty, then she herself gets the right to give her consent for the marriage or to deny the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if she is a minor or prepubescent girl, then her father/guardian could wed her to anyone, even without her consent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if she is prepubescent and also an orphan, then her guardian has the right to wed her with himself (even without her consent), in order to get her property and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5064/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5064:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated 'Urwa: that he asked `Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! &lt;strong&gt;(This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr (bride-dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr&lt;/strong&gt;, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) &lt;strong&gt;to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reasons that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no longer considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islamqa.com, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet, also refutes these modern Muslim preachers regarding verse 6:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse 4:6 explains that an orphan’s money is given to him/her after they reach puberty and attain sound judgement. What’s meant by sound judgment is sound management of money. This can only happen after puberty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Reaching Nikah” mentioned in the verse means reaching puberty which can be known through sings such as menstruation for females and the growth of pubic hair. The verse used the expression “reaching Nikah” to actually mean “reaching puberty” because in most cases, it’s adults who perform Nikah. But this doesn’t mean that it’s not possible for non-adults to perform Nikah, which is permissible as proven by the Quran, Sunnah and the consensus of scholars. Plus, the same Surah and the same context of verses proves it (the permissibility of child marriage). (The verse that speaks about giving an orphan his money when he/she reaches Nikah is verse no.6) Verse no.3 says: “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. ”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse proves it’s allowed to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of Allah's Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning women..' (4.127) “&lt;a class=&quot;external free&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This shows it’s allowed to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamweb.net/en/fatwa/86384/conditions-of-marriage-according-to-the-four-fiqh-schools&quot;&gt;Islamweb.Net&lt;/a&gt; (which is run by Qatari Ministry of Religious Affairs) writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamweb.net/en/fatwa/86384/conditions-of-marriage-according-to-the-four-fiqh-schools&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“1. The two parties of the marriage contract (the wife and the husband) should be mature, free, and sound-minded. If one of them has a perplexed state of mind or is an indiscriminating minor, then the contract that he/she conducted is valid if her Wali agrees on that; otherwise, it is invalid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whatever good ye do, lo! Allah is ever Aware of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was an Ijma (إجماع i.e. CONSENSUS) of Muslim Ummah that marriage with a minor girl is allowed. But in the present century, few modern Muslim Preachers (and Quranists, i.e. those who reject Hadith) have started denying it. They are trying to misuse verse 4:6 as an argument to deny marriage to minor girls in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=4&amp;amp;verse=6&quot;&gt;4:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;وَٱبْتَلُوا۟&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغُوا۟ ٱلنِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُم مِّنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَٱدْفَعُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And test the orphans until when they reached the age of marriage (Nikah), then if you perceive in them sound judgement then deliver to them their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Muslim preachers claim that one gets sound judgement about one's wealth when one is already an adult person. Thus, this means that Islam prescribed that one can marry only after becoming an adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Muslim Fatwa website &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;Islam Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أن الآية الكريمة ليس فيها منع تزويج الصغير أو الصغيرة، ولم تسق لبيان موضوع التزويج، وإنما هي في إيتاء المال لليتامى، وأن ذلك يكون بعد البلوغ،&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noble verse does not prohibit the marriage of minors, and it does not provide any clarification regarding the subject of marriage. Rather, it pertains to giving wealth to orphans, indicating that this should occur after they reach puberty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the word &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Nikah&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah&quot;&gt;Nikah&lt;/a&gt; has a double meaning in the Arabic language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the Islamic Sharia, &quot;Nikah&quot; is a terminology, whose meaning in Islamic Sharia is “marriage”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the literal meaning of “Nikah” in the Arabic language is &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;Nikah (Sexual Consummation of Marriage)&quot; href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Nikah_%28Sexual_Consummation_of_Marriage%29&quot;&gt;To do Sexual Intercourse&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes even more evident from another verse of Quran 17:34:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.34?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 17:34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا۟ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ &lt;strong&gt;أَشُدَّهُۥ&lt;/strong&gt; ۚ&lt;br&gt;Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of &lt;strong&gt;full strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word أَشُدَّهُ (full strength) in this verse means the age when young boys and girls start feeling the desire/strength to have sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as Shar'i Nikah (marriage) is concerned, then there is no condition present in it of reaching the أَشُدَّهُ (i.e. Full Strength to do the act of intercourse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proof is that prophet Muhammad himself did the Shar'i Nikah with 'Aisha when she was only 6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And no one tests a 6-year-old child for handing over his/her property to him/her, as a 6-year-old child has neither أَشُدَّهُ (Strength/Desire) nor he/she has any kind of “sound judgement” to look after his/her property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Shar'i Nikah has nothing to do with the أَشُدَّهُ (strength), as Muhammad did this Shar'i Nikah with 6 years 'Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, even at the age of 9, when 'Aisha finally came to the house of Muhammad for the consummation of marriage, she was still not mentally sound enough to look after any property or business. It is evident from the following hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-6130/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 6130:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated `Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, according to Islamic Sharia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a girl reaches puberty, then she herself gets the right to give her consent for the marriage or to deny the marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if she is a minor or prepubescent girl, then her father/guardian could wed her to anyone, even without her consent (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708/is-it-acceptable-to-marry-a-girl-who-has-not-yet-started-her-menses&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if she is prepubescent and also an orphan, then her guardian has the right to wed her with himself (even without her consent), in order to get her property and wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/DarusSalam/Hadith-5064/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari 5064:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated 'Urwa: that he asked `Aisha about the Statement of Allah: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! &lt;strong&gt;(This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr (bride-dowry) less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr&lt;/strong&gt;, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also evident from the following Quranic Verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/4.127?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 4:127:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You also read them (the guardians) in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) &lt;strong&gt;to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans.&quot; The good you do is known to God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orphan girl, in the above tradition, is a small orphan girl who has not yet reached puberty. It is due to the reasons that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot compel her to marry him without her consent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, after becoming an adult, the guardian cannot marry her by giving her less than a standard dowry (i.e. Haq Mehr). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, after becoming an adult, she will get full control of her money and property too, and thus the guardian cannot take control of her property any more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourthly, after becoming an adult, she is no longer considered an orphan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Islamqa.com, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet, also refutes these modern Muslim preachers regarding verse 6:4 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/256830/%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%89-%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AD&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse 4:6 explains that an orphan’s money is given to him/her after they reach puberty and attain sound judgement. What’s meant by sound judgment is sound management of money. This can only happen after puberty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Reaching Nikah” mentioned in the verse means reaching puberty which can be known through sings such as menstruation for females and the growth of pubic hair. The verse used the expression “reaching Nikah” to actually mean “reaching puberty” because in most cases, it’s adults who perform Nikah. But this doesn’t mean that it’s not possible for non-adults to perform Nikah, which is permissible as proven by the Quran, Sunnah and the consensus of scholars. Plus, the same Surah and the same context of verses proves it (the permissibility of child marriage). (The verse that speaks about giving an orphan his money when he/she reaches Nikah is verse no.6) Verse no.3 says: “And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. ”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse proves it’s allowed to marry an orphan. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;And an orphan cannot be an adult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s reported in Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2494: “Narrated Urwah that he asked `Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, &quot;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of Allah's Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning women..' (4.127) “&lt;a class=&quot;external free&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Hajar (d.1449 AD) commented on this Hadith saying: &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This shows it’s allowed to marry orphans who haven’t reached puberty. Because after puberty they can’t be called orphans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamweb.net/en/fatwa/86384/conditions-of-marriage-according-to-the-four-fiqh-schools&quot;&gt;Islamweb.Net&lt;/a&gt; (which is run by Qatari Ministry of Religious Affairs) writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamweb.net/en/fatwa/86384/conditions-of-marriage-according-to-the-four-fiqh-schools&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“1. The two parties of the marriage contract (the wife and the husband) should be mature, free, and sound-minded. If one of them has a perplexed state of mind or is an indiscriminating minor, then the contract that he/she conducted is valid if her Wali agrees on that; otherwise, it is invalid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Shia al-Islam.Org writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.al-islam.org/marriage-according-five-schools-islamic-law-muhammad-jawad-mughniyya/matrimonial-guardianship&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

Avot de-Rabbi Nathan, Version II, ch. 48, p. 66. The concern is that the young girl may become pregnant and die as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) Romans:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500 years before Muhammed, doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soranus_of_Ephesus&quot;&gt;Soranus&lt;/a&gt; wrote his book about gynaecology and in hit he stated that women could be considered fit for conception from 15. 15 is significantly older than 9. Soranus was from Ephesos and worked in Alexandria before he moved to Rome. So he had met desert-conditions girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soranus wrote in his book: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/book/2189958/9b5cce/soranus-gynecology.html&quot;&gt;Soranus, Of Ephesus and Owsei Temkin (1994) &lt;em&gt;Soranus’ gynecology&lt;/em&gt;. Baltimore Johns Hopkins Univ. Press.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 233):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book about gynecology in the section about problematic deliveries: &quot;For it obtains whenever women married before maturity conceive and give birth while the uterus has not yet fully grown nor the fundus of (the) uterus expanded.&quot; So they knew the pelvic floor and birth canal were not mature enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 227)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... difficult labor occur in those who give birth in a way which is contrary to nature? Diocles the Caerystan in the second book on gynecology says that primiparae and young women have difficult labor&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Recognize Those Capable of Conception:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since women usually are married for the sake of children and succession and not for mere enjoyment and since it is utterly absurd to make inquiries about the excellence of their lineage and the abundance of their means but to leave unexamined whether they can conceive or not and whether they are fit for childbearing or not it is only right for us to give an account of the matter in question One must judge the majority from the ages of 15 to 40 to be fit for conception&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here was the law in the Roman Empire before Muhammad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://classicalstudies.org/annual-meeting/146/abstract/roman-law-and-marriage-underage-girls&quot;&gt;Roman Law and the Marriage of Underage Girls&lt;/a&gt;:&quot;Twelve will seem to us undesirably young, and indeed ancient doctors such as Soranus warned against the dangers of women becoming sexually active at so early an age. Most Roman women appear to have married later, from about 15 to 20. But the possibility of efarlier marriage we know to have been actively pursued especially in upper-class families, where marriage often assisted dynastic alliances.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Sparta:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In fact, Sparta raised the marriage age from 18 to 20 with the primary aim of decreasing the number of sickly children. As a result, they observed an increase in life expectancy for women, which began to rival that of men. It became evident that child marriage was the main contributing factor to mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;While Athenian women might have expected to marry for the first time around the &lt;strong&gt;age of fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; to men much older than them, Spartan women normally married between the ages of eighteen and twenty to men close to them in age.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-FOOTNOTECartledge198194–95_29-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTECartledge198194%E2%80%9395-29&quot;&gt;[29]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Spartan ideology, the primary role of adult women was to bear and raise healthy children. This focus on childbearing was likely responsible for the emphasis on physical fitness in Spartan women, as it was believed that physically stronger women would have healthier children.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlundell1995157-32&quot;&gt;[32]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bearing and raising children was considered the most important role for women in Spartan society; equal to male warriors in the Spartan army.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-50&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-50&quot;&gt;[50]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Spartan women were encouraged to produce many children, preferably male, to increase Sparta's military population. They took pride in having borne and raised brave warriors.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-51&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta#cite_note-51&quot;&gt;[51]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hence, even with an emphasis on bearing numerous children, Sparta raised the age of marriage for women to 18–20 years. Interestingly, this decision did not hinder Spartan women from having many children. On the contrary, it led to a decrease in the mortality rate among both mothers and children. Additionally, this measure curbed the birth of weak offspring prone to diseases. As a result, only healthy and robust children were born, growing up to become outstanding warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&quot;text-24 xs:text-20&quot;&gt;Laws at the time of Muhammed.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two dominant neighbouring empires had already prohibited intercourse with 9 years old girls before Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ijtihadnet.com/wp-content/uploads/Minor-Marriage-in-Early-Islamic-Law.pdf&quot;&gt;Laws at the time of Muhammed Minor Marriage in Early Islamic Law, Carolyn G. Baugh, LEIDEN | BOSTON, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although investigation into Sasanian-era (224â€“651 CE) child marriage prac-tices unearths scant information, the age of twelve is again important for girls. According to the Avesta, the age of majority was clearly set at fifteen for boys as well as girls; Middle Persian civil law allowed marriage at age nine, provided that consummation wait until age twelve.[24]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byzantine law required that a girl attain the age of thirteen before contract-ing a marriage. Whether she would have consented to the marriage or not prior to this age is deemed immaterial as she would have no legally viable consent to give.[22] All parties to a marriage needed to issue consent, including the groom, the bride, and her parents. In cases where a girl consented to intercourse prior to marriage it was assumed that she consented to the marriage itself and the families would then arrange it. However, if that intercourse occurred prior to the age of thirteen, the groom would meet with the law’s most serious punish-ments due to the girl’s assumed legal inability to consent.[23]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Muhammed it was known to be injurious to girls to engage in very early intercourse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Consequences of Child Marriage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modem Medicine shows that childbirth for females below the age of seventeen and â€¢ above forty leads to &lt;strong&gt;greater maternal mortality as well as infant mortality&lt;/strong&gt; (London  1992, 501). It must he made clear that although conditions commonly associated with poverty, e.g. malnutrition, poor physical health and other negative circumstances may contribute to difficult births and bad health for young mothers, consistent findings indicate that the age factor plays a significant role by itself. &quot;Even under the best of modern conditions, women who give birth before the age of seventeen have a higher mortality rate than older women. The closer a woman is to menarche, &lt;strong&gt;the greater the risk to both mother and child, as well as to the mother's future child bearing capabilities, for the reproductive system has not completely matured when ovulation begins&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. (Demand 1994, 102).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem seen more often among underprivileged women is that they develop **fistulae which is often due to the pelvis not having fully formed. This can be caused by a complicated pregnancy or having intercourse at a very young age.**28. This leads the girl or woman to have permanent damage and often she is shunned by her family and community (4). Although such a condition is preventable it requires a good health service and communications systems (S). Unfortunately, these are often not available in impoverished areas of the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge of medical complications involved with early marriage cannot be considered &quot;new&quot; findings. Ancient and Medieval Medicine texts indicate that doctors were well aware of the physical harm posed to girls by early marriages and pregnancies&lt;/strong&gt;. â€¦â€¦..In fact, not only doctors of Medicine but other scholars in Most societies had a clear understanding that intercourse should not take place before the menarche. &lt;strong&gt;Hesiod suggested marriage in the fifth year after puberty, or age nineteen, and Plato in the Laws mandated from sixteen to twenty years of age, and in the Republic he gave the age as twenty. Aristotle specifically warned against early childbearing for women as a cause of small and weak infants and difficult and dangerous labor for the mother, and the Spartans avoided it for just those reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; (Demand 1994, 102)&lt;/p&gt;

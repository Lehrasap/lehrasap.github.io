		<summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Summary:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran contains many scientific errors regarding the nature of meteors, also known as shooting stars. According to the Quran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It describes the existence of seven heavens, with the lowest 1st heaven being closest to Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stars (which appear &lt;strong&gt;STATIC&lt;/strong&gt; to us) are depicted as '&lt;strong&gt;burning&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;lamps&lt;/strong&gt;' as they are visible to us emitting light. They are placed under the lowest 1st heaven of the Earth to &lt;strong&gt;adorn&lt;/strong&gt; it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quran claims that these same stars  (which are static in their normal state and serve as lamps) transform into SHOOTING stars (i.e. meterors) when angels throw these static stars as missiles to attack the devils who try to listen to Allah's commandments in the first heaven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern scientific knowledge contradicts this Quranic account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lamps like static stars don't turn into shooting stars. Stars are massive, self-luminous celestial bodies made of gas, emitting light and heat through nuclear fusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the shooting stars are asteroids, which are rocky objects, primarily found between Mars and Jupiter in the asteroid belt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These asteroids are not burning and emitting lights as '&lt;strong&gt;burning lamps&lt;/strong&gt;'. And they are also not &lt;strong&gt;adorning&lt;/strong&gt; the sky. No, but they are dark, and cold and totally invisible to our human eye. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When asteroids collide, they break into smaller fragments called meteoroids. When these meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere, they burn up due to friction and appear as meteors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next clash between the Quran and science is that the author of the Quran was unaware of the existence of dark stars along with asteroids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In space, aside from burning stars like the sun, there are trillions of solid stars similar to our Earth, but they don't appear twinkling to us; rather, they are completely dark and invisible to the human eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apart from burning stars like the sun, we can only see a few nearby planets, such as Mars and Jupiter, which twinkle because they reflect sunlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the trillions of stars that do not burn like the sun remain invisible to us, and they do not adorn the sky because their distance from Earth is so great that their reflected light cannot reach us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the author of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad himself) had no knowledge of these trillions of dark stars, along with asteroids. Instead, according to the Quran, all stars in the sky are twinkling because Allah created all of them to adorn the world’s first heaven with their brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Table of Contents:&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id=&quot;mozToc&quot;&gt;&lt;!--mozToc h1 1 h2 2 h3 3 h4 4 h5 5 h6 6--&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId730461&quot;&gt;Quranic claim: Stars are lamps that transform into 'burning flames' (i.e. shooting stars) when hit to the devils&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId581731&quot;&gt;1st Blunder: Meteoroids are neither stars, nor lamps, nor do they emit light, nor do they beautify 1st heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId253982&quot;&gt;2nd Blunder: Meteoroids never pursue or chase anything, such as devils, but instead, they merely follow the gravitational path&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId834576&quot;&gt;Science can already foretell in advance when (on what date and at what time) the devils will steal the so-called command of Allah from the 1st heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId807076&quot;&gt;3rd Blunder: The Quran implies that the 1st Heaven of Earth is merely 62 miles away from Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId703226&quot;&gt;4th Blunder: Contradiction in the Quran regarding the distance of the 1st heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId63063&quot;&gt;5th Blunder: Devils create a ladder by standing on each other's shoulders to reach the 1st heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId812278&quot;&gt;6th Blunder: Only after the prophethood of Muhammad, devils are hit by shooting stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId209155&quot;&gt;7th Blunder: The false Challenge of Allah that humans (and Jinns) cannot cross the regions of heavens and EARTH&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId349922&quot;&gt;Muslim Excuse: These are not meteors, but the Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays, which are used to shoot down the devils by Allah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId982301&quot;&gt;Only a SINGLE scientific mistake is enough to prove that whole Islam is fake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId730461&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quranic claim: 'Stars' (which appear static to us) are like burning lamps that transform into 'Shooting Stars'  when they have to hit the devils&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see the following 2 verses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5&quot;&gt;37:6-10&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;إِنَّا &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;زَيَّنَّا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; بِزِينَةٍ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلْكَوَاكِبِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَحِفْظًا مِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَٰنٍ مَّارِدٍ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, We have adorned (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;زَيَّنَّا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) (lowest of 7 heavens, i.e.) the heaven of Earth (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) with an adornment of stars (Arabic: Kawakib &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;كَوَاكِبِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). And (to) guard against every devil rebellious, [So] they may not listen to the exalted assembly [of angels] and are pelted from every side. Repelled; and for them is a constant punishment. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Except one who snatches [some words] by theft, but they are pursued/chased by a burning flame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, piercing [in brightness].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/67.5&quot;&gt;67:5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَلَقَدْ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;زَيَّنَّا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; بِمَصَٰبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَٰهَا رُجُومًا لِّلشَّيَٰطِينِ ۖ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلسَّعِيرِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And certainly We have adorned (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;زَيَّنَّا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heaven of Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(i.e. the lowest heaven from among the 7 heaves, and which is closest to the Earth. Arabic:  السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا) &lt;strong&gt;with lamps &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;(i.e. static stars) and We have made them (as) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;missiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;devils.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quranic verses state that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Stars (which appear static to us) serve as beautiful lamps adorning the lowest heaven, closest to Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These lamps (i.e. static stars) transformed into missile like &quot;shooting stars&quot;, when used as missiles against the devils who attempt to eavesdrop on the heavenly assembly of angels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, according to these verses, Allah asserts that static looking stars are radiant lamps positioned by Him in the first heaven to enhance its beauty and, when required, become fiery projectiles to repel and punish rebellious devils seeking forbidden knowledge from the divine assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Hadith also proves that these &lt;em&gt;shooting stars&lt;/em&gt; are the same as &lt;em&gt;the static lamps like stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2229a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2229a:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قَالَ أَخْبَرَنِي رَجُلٌ، مِنْ أَصْحَابِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم مِنَ الأَنْصَارِ أَنَّهُمْ بَيْنَمَا هُمْ جُلُوسٌ لَيْلَةً مَعَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم رُمِيَ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;بِنَجْمٍ&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;فَاسْتَنَارَ فَقَالَ لَهُمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏&quot;‏ مَاذَا كُنْتُمْ تَقُولُونَ فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ إِذَا رُمِيَ بِمِثْلِ هَذَا ‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏ قَالُوا اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَعْلَمُ كُنَّا نَقُولُ وُلِدَ اللَّيْلَةَ رَجُلٌ عَظِيمٌ وَمَاتَ رَجُلٌ عَظِيمٌ فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏&quot;‏ فَإِنَّهَا لاَ يُرْمَى بِهَا لِمَوْتِ أَحَدٍ وَلاَ لِحَيَاتِهِ وَلَكِنْ رَبُّنَا تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى اسْمُهُ إِذَا قَضَى أَمْرًا سَبَّحَ حَمَلَةُ الْعَرْشِ ثُمَّ سَبَّحَ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ التَّسْبِيحُ أَهْلَ هَذِهِ السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ قَالَ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَ حَمَلَةَ الْعَرْشِ لِحَمَلَةِ الْعَرْشِ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ فَيُخْبِرُونَهُمْ مَاذَا قَالَ - قَالَ - فَيَسْتَخْبِرُ بَعْضُ أَهْلِ السَّمَوَاتِ بَعْضًا حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الْخَبَرُ هَذِهِ السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا فَتَخْطَفُ الْجِنُّ السَّمْعَ فَيَقْذِفُونَ إِلَى أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ وَيُرْمَوْنَ بِهِ فَمَا جَاءُوا بِهِ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ فَهُوَ حَقٌّ وَلَكِنَّهُمْ يَقْرِفُونَ فِيهِ وَيَزِيدُونَ ‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were sitting during the night with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), a meteor &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note: This is a Tehrif (distortion) in the English Translation, as Hadith did not use the word meteor, but &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;STAR بِنَجْمٍ&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;gave a dazzling light. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: What did you say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shooting star? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: These shooting stars neither appear at the death of anyone nor on the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; when He decides to do a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of heaven who are near to them&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;until this glory of God reaches them who are in the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; heaven of this world &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(i.e. the first and the lowest heaven, السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا)&lt;/em&gt;. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the (lowest) heaven of the world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages to overhear and he carries it to his friends. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And when the Angels see the jinn (devil) they attack them with the meteors (shooting stars)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in this hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The companions witnessed a star, which gave a dazzling light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad affirmed to his companions that these celestial phenomena were, indeed, the burning flames employed to assail and chase the devils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, Muhammad also confirmed in this hadith that the whole star نجم becomes a shooting star (i.e. meteor), which is a scientific mistake. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the following supporting Hadith establishes too that these whole stars turn into shooting stars (i.e. meteors)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=3030&amp;amp;idto=3030&amp;amp;bk_no=0&amp;amp;ID=2016&quot;&gt;link 1 &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/mishkat:4602&quot;&gt;link 2&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَعَن قتادةَ قَالَ: خلقَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى هَذِه &lt;strong&gt;النجومَ&lt;/strong&gt; لثلاثٍ جَعَلَهَا زِينَةً لِلسَّمَاءِ وَرُجُومًا لِلشَّيَاطِينِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatada said God most high created these (static looking) &lt;strong&gt;stars&lt;/strong&gt; for three purposes; He made them an adornment for the sky, missiles for the devils, and signs by which people find their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId581731&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1st Blunder: Meteoroids are neither stars, nor lamps, nor do they emit light, nor do they beautify the 1st heaven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the Quranic assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The static looking stars, described as lamps in verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/67.5&quot;&gt;67:5&lt;/a&gt;, are &lt;strong&gt;visible &lt;/strong&gt;celestial bodies that adorn the first heaven. But these static stars do not transform into shooting stars as claimed by the Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, shooting stars, known as meteoroids, are small pebble-sized objects that ignite into burning flames only upon entering Earth's atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to their atmospheric entry, meteoroids do travel like missiles towards the earth due to its gravitational power, but without emitting any fire or light or flame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They also don't serve as adornments for the sky; in fact, they remain dark and imperceptible to the naked eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, meteoroids do not possess the ability to guide people in finding their way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId253982&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2nd Blunder: Even Meteoroids never pursue or chase anything, such as devils, but instead, they merely follow the gravitational path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/15.16?context=3&quot;&gt;15:16-18&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And We have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers. And We have protected it from every devil accursed. &lt;em&gt;Except one who steals a hearing and is &lt;strong&gt;chased&lt;/strong&gt; away by &lt;strong&gt;a clear burning flame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5&quot;&gt;37:6-10&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, We have adorned (lowest of 7 heavens, i.e.) the heaven of Earth (Arabic:  السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا) with an adornment of stars. And (to) guard against every devil rebellious, [So] they may not listen to the exalted assembly [of angels] and are pelted from every side. Repelled; and for them is a constant punishment. &lt;em&gt;Except one who snatches [some words] by theft, but they are &lt;strong&gt;pursued&lt;/strong&gt; by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a burning flame&lt;/em&gt;, piercing [in brightness].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these Quranic verses are indeed accurate, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, an angel must specifically aim at the devils while throwing the meteors towards them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, pursuing or chasing an escaping devil like a missile also implies that the burning flame should have the ability to change its path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Quran is mistaken in this regard, as even meteors never alter their path. They solely follow the gravity of the earth and adhere to the laws of physics, travelling in a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId834576&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Science can already foretell in advance when (on what date and at what time) the devils will steal the so-called command of Allah from the 1st heaven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the following news (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/eta-aquarid-meteor-shower-see-23866858&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 50 shooting stars an hour are expected to light up the night sky during the Eta Aquarid meteor shower. The dazzling display takes place between April 19 and May 28 but will peak this year on Friday (May 6) ... Experts at Royal Observatory Greenwich say the best time to catch a glimpse of the celestial display – which will be visible all over the world – will be between midnight and dawn on Friday ... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, scientists can now predict in advance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specific date and time when the devils will supposedly steal the so-called command of Allah from the 1st heaven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can also anticipate the &quot;rate of stealing,&quot; i.e., how many devils will allegedly steal the commands of Allah per hour (up to 50 shooting stars an hour during the Eta Aquarid meteor shower).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies that modern scientists seemingly possess knowledge of the future, paralleling Allah's omniscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just hope that Muslims can realize how ridiculous the Quranic story about devils and shooting stars has become in the light of modern science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId807076&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3rd Blunder: The Quran implies that the 1st Heaven of Earth is merely 62 miles away from Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Quran, when devils attempt to eavesdrop on the assembly of angels to hear the commands of Allah, they are struck with shooting stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern science has demonstrated that meteoroids only ignite upon entering Earth's atmosphere from space. Since space begins approximately 62 miles above Earth's surface, it suggests that the 1st Heaven is situated within this distance of 62 miles according to the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/72.8?context=2&quot;&gt;72:8-9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Jinns said] We sought to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;touch the heaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but we found it filled (with) guards severe, and burning flames. And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: If scientists are not blind, they have not observed any solid heaven as the Quran and Ahadith claim, positioned only 62 miles away. Additionally, they have not witnessed the assembly of angels, nor have they seen Adam laughing and weeping, or the descendants of Adam there. Refer to the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:163&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 163&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ... Gabriel ascended with me to the heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven (i.e. the heaven of the earth), Gabriel said to the guardian of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied. It is Gabriel. He again asked who is there with you. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes. Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. &lt;em&gt;When he looked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept.&lt;/em&gt; He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: &lt;em&gt;He is Adam (peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It casts doubt on the credibility of the Quran's writer, who narrated fictional tales to impress the people of that era when knowledge was limited, thinking no one could verify or refute his stories about shooting stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId703226&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4th Blunder: Contradiction in the Quran regarding the distance of the 1st heaven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the Quran's writer claimed that shooting star incidents occur in the 1st heaven, implying that it is 62 miles away from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the other hand, the same writer also asserted that all stars are positioned under the 1st heaven, placed by Allah to adorn this lowest heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5&quot;&gt;37:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, We (Allah) have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern science, however, has exposed this contradiction in the Quran, proving that stars are actually located billions of light-years away from Earth, which also then automatically mean that the 1st heaven is also billions of light years away from the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We urge Muslims to contemplate this apparent inconsistency in the Quran, if the 1st heave is 62 miles away, or billions of light years away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId63063&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5th Blunder: Devils create a ladder by standing on each other's shoulders to reach the 1st heaven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This so-called Sahih Hadith presents an absurd account where Muhammad claims that devils ascend to the 1st heaven by forming a ladder of sorts, with the uppermost devil stealing the command of Allah and passing it down the chain to the lowest devil on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4800&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4800&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Prophet said, &quot;When Allah decrees some order in the heaven, the angels flutter their wings indicating complete surrender to His saying which sounds like chains being dragged on rock. And when the state of fear disappears, they ask each other, &quot;What has your Lord ordered? They say that He has said that which is true and just, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.&quot; (34.23). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then the stealthy listeners (devils) hear this order, and these stealthy listeners are like this, one over the other [i.e. standing upon the shoulders of each other and making a ladder].&quot; Sufyan, a sub-narrator demonstrated that by holding his hand upright and separating the fingers. A stealthy listener hears a word which he will convey to that which is below him and the second will convey it to that which is below him till the last of them will convey it to the wizard or foreteller.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sometimes a flame (fire) may strike the devil before he can convey it, and sometimes he may convey it before the flame (fire) strikes him&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, whereupon the wizard adds to that word a hundred lies. The people will then say, 'Didn't he (i.e. magician) tell such-and-such a thing on such-and-such date?' So that magician is said to have told the truth because of the Statement which has been heard from the heavens.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; According to the Quran, the 1st heaven is located billions of light-years away from Earth, as all stars exist under the 1st heaven to beautify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Muhammad's account states that devils can reach this faraway 1st heaven by merely standing on each other's shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is highly implausible for any rational person in this modern scientific era to believe in such a ridiculous fairytale promoted by Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Hadith becomes even more absurd when it claims that the missiles struck by Allah's orders sometimes miss their targets, allowing the devil to successfully hear and then pass on Allah's commands to the devil below him. But the question is h&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;ow can infallible angels miss their target? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologists may argue that the Quran and Hadith are not books of science, but the question remains: Why do Allah and Muhammad present completely false scientific facts in them if they are not meant to be taken as scientific truths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId812278&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;6th Blunder: Only after the prophethood of Muhammad, devils were started to be hit by shooting stars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand why the writer of the Quran, who we believe to be Muhammad himself, fabricated the story of shooting stars and devils. It seems, there were 2 main reasons which compelled Muhammad to make this story: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, people were doubting Muhammad, as he claimed in the Quran that ONLY Allah knows UNSEEN. But then there was a contradiction in the Quran that soothsayers were able to tell Moses about the future unseen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, despite claiming prophethood and receiving news of the future and the unseen from Allah, people still sought the services of soothsayers to inquire about the future, offering them money and sacrifices to gain knowledge about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad desired to monopolize the domain of future knowledge and unseen events by discrediting soothsayers. To achieve this, he invented a narrative stating that soothsayers could indeed foretell the future in the past, as devils used to steal news, and then bring them news from the 1st heaven. However, after Muhammad's prophethood, this practice ceased, and Allah began to hit the devils with shooting stars whenever they tried to eavesdrop on His commands in the 1st heaven. Muhammad cited Quran 72:8-9 as evidence of this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/72.8?context=2&quot;&gt;72:8-9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Jinns said] We sought to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;touch the heaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but we found it filled (with) guards severe, and burning flames. And&lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;we used to sit therein (in the past)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in positions for hearing, but whoever listens &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. after the prophethood of Muhammad) will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By crafting this story, Muhammad successfully undermined the significance of soothsayers and their ability to predict the future. However, this story created another issue. If shooting stars were not used for hitting the devils before Muhammad's prophethood, what purpose did the transformation of stars into burning flames (shooting stars) serve during that time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad, or the writer of the Quran, never addressed this question during his lifetime, perhaps unable to provide a satisfactory explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later generations of Muslims were also unable to present any conclusive evidence to support this claim. Ibn Kathir attempted to provide an argument in his Tafsir (under verse 72:8), suggesting that incidents of shooting stars (meteors) occurred before Muhammad's prophethood, but they were infrequent  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quran4u.com/Tafsir%20Ibn%20Kathir/072%20Jinn.htm&quot;&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir, under verse 72:8&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be that shooting stars (meteors) occurred before this (i.e. the prophethood of Muhammad), however it did not happen much, rather only occasionally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every sane person can see that the argument of Ibn Kathir is nothing more than a lame excuse and a lie. There is no proof that incidents of meteors occurred only occasionally before Muhammad, and their rate increased after his prophethood. Meteors were falling all over the world, and none of the people of that era in the rest of the world noted any increase in the rate of meteors after the prophethood of Muhammad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seventh Blunder: Iblis and His Entire Nation of Satans Were &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;Unaware&lt;/span&gt; of the Prophethood of Muhammad and existence of the Muslims &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;for Many Years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Islamic story, there was initially only one Iblis devil (i.e. Lucifer). But a question arose: how could this single Iblis devil reach millions of people around the world at every moment and tempt them all simultaneously? So, what is the difference then between Iblis and Allah, as both are present all over at the same time? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, the Islamic story added to it that Iblis is not like Allah, he cannot be present all over at the same time, and there also exist &quot;small devils/Jinns&quot;, who work for IBLIS (i.e. LUCIFER). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note: There is no concept of 'jinn' in the Bible of Jews and Christians. Muhammad copied this concept from his own pre-Islamic Arab culture, where Jinns were present. Reference: &lt;span class=&quot;x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xzsf02u&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/jinni&quot;&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/jinni&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xzsf02u&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad narrated a strange story, according to which neither Iblis nor small devils were aware of existence of Muhammad, his prophethood and the Muslims for many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:449&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 449&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn 'Abbas reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) neither recited the Qur'an to the Jinn nor did he see them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out with some of his Companions with the intention of going to the bazaar of 'Ukaz And there had been (at that time) obstructions between satans and the news from the Heaven, and there were flung flames upon them. So satan went back to their people and they said: What has happened to you? They said: There have been created obstructions between us and the news from the Heaven. And there have been flung upon us flames. &lt;strong&gt;They said: It cannot happen but for some (important) event. So traverse the eastern parts of the earth and the western parts and find out why is it that there have been created obstructions between us and the news from the Heaven. So they went forth and traversed the easts of the earth and its wests. Some of them proceeded towards Tihama and that is a nakhl towards the bazaar of 'Ukaz and he (the Holy Prophet) was leading his Companions in the morning prayer. So when they heard the Qur'an. they listened to it attentively and said: It is this which has caused obstruction between us and news from the Heaven. They went back to their people and said: O our people, we have heard a strange Qur'an which directs us to the right path; so we affirm our faith in it and we would never associate anyone with our Lord.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also look at this hadith, where Iblis is himself unawre of Muhammad and Muslims for many years: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3324&quot;&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi, Hadith 3324&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
Ibn Abbas said: “The jinns used to ascent through the heavens, trying to listen about the Revelation. So when they heard a statement, they would add nine to it. The statement that they heard would be true, while what they added was false. So it was with the advent of the Messenger of Allah that they were prevented from their places. So they mentioned that to &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iblis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – and the stars were not shot at them before that. &lt;em&gt;So Iblis said to them: ‘This is naught but an event that has occurred in the earth.’ So he sent out his armies, and they found the Messenger of Allah standing in Salat between two mountains” – I think he said “in Makkah” – “So they (returned) to meet with him (Iblis), and informed him. He said: ‘This is the event that has happened on the earth.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; (Darussalam)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Muhammad asserted that after the shooting stars began striking the Jinns, some of them came to him and embraced Islam under his guidance. Through this narrative, Muhammad aimed to further elevate his significance and instill greater fear in the hearts of his followers by implying that even jinn were under his control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the tale became highly implausible, as it implied that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No devil was present in Mecca for many years since none of them were aware of Muhammad's prophethood and existence of the Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This would imply that during all those years, the pagans of Mecca were free from committing any sin, as no devils were present in Mecca to mislead them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can any rational person believe such an implausible story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that when trying to cover up one lie, many more are often needed, and this narrative of Iblis' ignorance about Muhammad's prophethood for several years seems to be one such attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId209155&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;8th Blunder: The false Challenge of Allah that humans (and Jinns) cannot cross the regions of heavens and EARTH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Quranic verses 55:33-35, Allah challenges the jinn and mankind, daring them to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the Earth without His permission. The text suggests that those who try will be met with a flame of fire and smoke that they cannot defend against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran 55:33-35:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O company of jinn and mankind,&lt;strong&gt; if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass&lt;/strong&gt;. You will not pass except by authority/permission [from Allah] ... &lt;strong&gt;There will be sent upon you a &lt;em&gt;flame of fire (i.e. meteor) and smoke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and you will not be able to defend yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to reach the heavens and encounter God is a recurring theme in various cultures and historical accounts, and the Quran also presents a story about Pharaoh's ambitious endeavor to construct a tower reaching the heavens. In Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/28.38&quot;&gt;28:38&lt;/a&gt; and Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/40.37&quot;&gt;40:36-37&lt;/a&gt;, it is narrated that Pharaoh instructed his minister Haman to build such a structure, hoping to challenge the divine authority of Moses' God. And there were also many stories in earlier civilizations that Pharaoh indeed reached near heaven. Imam Qurtabi recorded one such story in his commentary of this verse 28:38 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;amp;tSoraNo=28&amp;amp;tAyahNo=38&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As-Suddi reported that Pharaoh climbed upon the tower and threw an arrow towards the sky, so it came down stained with blood. So Pharaoh said, 'I killed the God of Moosa (Moses).' It was reported that when Pharaoh said this, Allaah sent down Jibreel who struck the tower with his wing and cut it into three pieces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) challenged that nobody can cross the regions of heaven and the earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, contrary to Allah's claim, non-Muslims, atheists, and Hindus, who all deny Allah, have already crossed the regions of the Earth without His permission, and no flame of fire or smoke has stopped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Quranic verse (which is threatening humans &amp;amp; Jinns with &lt;strong&gt;flame of fire and smoke&lt;/strong&gt;) seems to have a connection to the story in other parts of the Quran, where devils attempt to sit in the 1st heaven, and stars transform into &lt;strong&gt;flames of fire (i.e. meteors)&lt;/strong&gt; to chase and attack them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId349922&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muslim Excuse: These are not meteors, but the &lt;em&gt;Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays, which&lt;/em&gt; are used to shoot down the devils by Allah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Muslim apologists sometimes claim that these challenges involve &quot;Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.answering-christianity.com/shooting_stars_miracle.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) used by Allah to shoot down devils. However, this excuse has no basis in the original Quranic claim, for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays&quot; are not guided; they disperse in all directions and are invisible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These gamma rays do not resemble burning flames of fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quran and Hadith specifically mention shooting stars (meteors) as the means to hit devils, not any form of invisible gamma rays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Shooting_Stars_and_Eavesdropping_Shaytans&quot;&gt;Shooting Stars and Eavesdropping Shaytans in earlier Cultures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Moreover, t&lt;span&gt;he idea of shooting stars chasing away eavesdropping devils may have Jewish roots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Testament of Solomon:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The firmament is conceived in a tripartite structure and demons are portrayed as being capable of flying up to and past the firmament in order to eavesdrop on the decisions of God. (Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testament_of_Solomon&quot;&gt;Testament of Solomon - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Babylonian Talmud, demons are described as having some angelic qualities, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mt-md block&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;They know what will be in the future like ministering angels. The Gemara is puzzled by this last statement: Should it enter your mind that they know this? Not even the angels are privy to the future. Rather, they hear from behind the curtain when God reveals something of the future, like ministering angels.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, even a single scientific mistake in the Quran is significant, as it challenges the notion of 100%  Allah's perfection and cast doubt on the authenticity of the entire Islamic belief system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Summary:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran contains many scientific errors regarding the nature of meteors, also known as shooting stars. According to the Quran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It describes the existence of seven heavens, with the lowest 1st heaven being closest to Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stars (which appear &lt;strong&gt;STATIC&lt;/strong&gt; to us) are depicted as '&lt;strong&gt;burning&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;lamps&lt;/strong&gt;' as they are visible to us emitting light. They are placed under the lowest 1st heaven of the Earth to &lt;strong&gt;adorn&lt;/strong&gt; it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quran claims that these same stars  (which are static in their normal state and serve as lamps) transform into SHOOTING stars (i.e. meterors) when angels throw these static stars as missiles to attack the devils who try to listen to Allah's commandments in the first heaven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern scientific knowledge contradicts this Quranic account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lamps like static stars don't turn into shooting stars. Stars are massive, self-luminous celestial bodies made of gas, emitting light and heat through nuclear fusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the shooting stars are asteroids, which are rocky objects, primarily found between Mars and Jupiter in the asteroid belt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These asteroids are not burning and emitting lights as '&lt;strong&gt;burning lamps&lt;/strong&gt;'. And they are also not &lt;strong&gt;adorning&lt;/strong&gt; the sky. No, but they are dark, and cold and totally invisible to our human eye. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When asteroids collide, they break into smaller fragments called meteoroids. When these meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere, they burn up due to friction and appear as meteors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next clash between the Quran and science is that the author of the Quran was unaware of the existence of dark stars along with asteroids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In space, aside from burning stars like the sun, there are trillions of solid stars similar to our Earth, but they don't appear twinkling to us; rather, they are completely dark and invisible to the human eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apart from burning stars like the sun, we can only see a few nearby planets, such as Mars and Jupiter, which twinkle because they reflect sunlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the trillions of stars that do not burn like the sun remain invisible to us, and they do not adorn the sky because their distance from Earth is so great that their reflected light cannot reach us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the author of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad himself) had no knowledge of these trillions of dark stars, along with asteroids. Instead, according to the Quran, all stars in the sky are twinkling because Allah created all of them to adorn the world’s first heaven with their brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Table of Contents:&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id=&quot;mozToc&quot;&gt;&lt;!--mozToc h1 1 h2 2 h3 3 h4 4 h5 5 h6 6--&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId730461&quot;&gt;Quranic claim: Stars are lamps that transform into 'burning flames' (i.e. shooting stars) when hit to the devils&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId581731&quot;&gt;1st Blunder: Meteoroids are neither stars, nor lamps, nor do they emit light, nor do they beautify 1st heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId253982&quot;&gt;2nd Blunder: Meteoroids never pursue or chase anything, such as devils, but instead, they merely follow the gravitational path&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId834576&quot;&gt;Science can already foretell in advance when (on what date and at what time) the devils will steal the so-called command of Allah from the 1st heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId807076&quot;&gt;3rd Blunder: The Quran implies that the 1st Heaven of Earth is merely 62 miles away from Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId703226&quot;&gt;4th Blunder: Contradiction in the Quran regarding the distance of the 1st heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId63063&quot;&gt;5th Blunder: Devils create a ladder by standing on each other's shoulders to reach the 1st heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId812278&quot;&gt;6th Blunder: Only after the prophethood of Muhammad, devils are hit by shooting stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId209155&quot;&gt;7th Blunder: The false Challenge of Allah that humans (and Jinns) cannot cross the regions of heavens and EARTH&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId349922&quot;&gt;Muslim Excuse: These are not meteors, but the Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays, which are used to shoot down the devils by Allah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId982301&quot;&gt;Only a SINGLE scientific mistake is enough to prove that whole Islam is fake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId730461&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quranic claim: 'Stars' (which appear static to us) are like burning lamps that transform into 'Shooting Stars'  when they have to hit the devils&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see the following 2 verses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5&quot;&gt;37:6-10&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;إِنَّا &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;زَيَّنَّا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; بِزِينَةٍ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلْكَوَاكِبِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَحِفْظًا مِّن كُلِّ شَيْطَٰنٍ مَّارِدٍ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, We have adorned (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;زَيَّنَّا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) (lowest of 7 heavens, i.e.) the heaven of Earth (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) with an adornment of stars (Arabic: Kawakib &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;كَوَاكِبِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). And (to) guard against every devil rebellious, [So] they may not listen to the exalted assembly [of angels] and are pelted from every side. Repelled; and for them is a constant punishment. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Except one who snatches [some words] by theft, but they are pursued/chased by a burning flame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, piercing [in brightness].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/67.5&quot;&gt;67:5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَلَقَدْ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;زَيَّنَّا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1200ff;&quot;&gt;ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; بِمَصَٰبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَٰهَا رُجُومًا لِّلشَّيَٰطِينِ ۖ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلسَّعِيرِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And certainly We have adorned (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;زَيَّنَّا&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heaven of Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(i.e. the lowest heaven from among the 7 heaves, and which is closest to the Earth. Arabic:  السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا) &lt;strong&gt;with lamps &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;(i.e. static stars) and We have made them (as) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;missiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;devils.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quranic verses state that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Stars (which appear static to us) serve as beautiful lamps adorning the lowest heaven, closest to Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These lamps (i.e. static stars) transformed into missile like &quot;shooting stars&quot;, when used as missiles against the devils who attempt to eavesdrop on the heavenly assembly of angels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, according to these verses, Allah asserts that static looking stars are radiant lamps positioned by Him in the first heaven to enhance its beauty and, when required, become fiery projectiles to repel and punish rebellious devils seeking forbidden knowledge from the divine assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Hadith also proves that these &lt;em&gt;shooting stars&lt;/em&gt; are the same as &lt;em&gt;the static lamps like stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2229a&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2229a:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قَالَ أَخْبَرَنِي رَجُلٌ، مِنْ أَصْحَابِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم مِنَ الأَنْصَارِ أَنَّهُمْ بَيْنَمَا هُمْ جُلُوسٌ لَيْلَةً مَعَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم رُمِيَ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;بِنَجْمٍ&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;فَاسْتَنَارَ فَقَالَ لَهُمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏&quot;‏ مَاذَا كُنْتُمْ تَقُولُونَ فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ إِذَا رُمِيَ بِمِثْلِ هَذَا ‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏ قَالُوا اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَعْلَمُ كُنَّا نَقُولُ وُلِدَ اللَّيْلَةَ رَجُلٌ عَظِيمٌ وَمَاتَ رَجُلٌ عَظِيمٌ فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏&quot;‏ فَإِنَّهَا لاَ يُرْمَى بِهَا لِمَوْتِ أَحَدٍ وَلاَ لِحَيَاتِهِ وَلَكِنْ رَبُّنَا تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى اسْمُهُ إِذَا قَضَى أَمْرًا سَبَّحَ حَمَلَةُ الْعَرْشِ ثُمَّ سَبَّحَ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ التَّسْبِيحُ أَهْلَ هَذِهِ السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ قَالَ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَ حَمَلَةَ الْعَرْشِ لِحَمَلَةِ الْعَرْشِ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ فَيُخْبِرُونَهُمْ مَاذَا قَالَ - قَالَ - فَيَسْتَخْبِرُ بَعْضُ أَهْلِ السَّمَوَاتِ بَعْضًا حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الْخَبَرُ هَذِهِ السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا فَتَخْطَفُ الْجِنُّ السَّمْعَ فَيَقْذِفُونَ إِلَى أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ وَيُرْمَوْنَ بِهِ فَمَا جَاءُوا بِهِ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ فَهُوَ حَقٌّ وَلَكِنَّهُمْ يَقْرِفُونَ فِيهِ وَيَزِيدُونَ ‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were sitting during the night with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), a meteor &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note: This is a Tehrif (distortion) in the English Translation, as Hadith did not use the word meteor, but &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;STAR بِنَجْمٍ&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;gave a dazzling light. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: What did you say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shooting star? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: These shooting stars neither appear at the death of anyone nor on the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; when He decides to do a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of heaven who are near to them&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;until this glory of God reaches them who are in the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; heaven of this world &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(i.e. the first and the lowest heaven, السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا)&lt;/em&gt;. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the (lowest) heaven of the world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages to overhear and he carries it to his friends. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And when the Angels see the jinn (devil) they attack them with the meteors (shooting stars)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in this hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The companions witnessed a star, which gave a dazzling light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad affirmed to his companions that these celestial phenomena were, indeed, the burning flames employed to assail and chase the devils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, Muhammad also confirmed in this hadith that the whole star نجم becomes a shooting star (i.e. meteor), which is a scientific mistake. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the following supporting Hadith establishes too that these whole stars turn into shooting stars (i.e. meteors)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;idfrom=3030&amp;amp;idto=3030&amp;amp;bk_no=0&amp;amp;ID=2016&quot;&gt;link 1 &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/mishkat:4602&quot;&gt;link 2&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَعَن قتادةَ قَالَ: خلقَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى هَذِه &lt;strong&gt;النجومَ&lt;/strong&gt; لثلاثٍ جَعَلَهَا زِينَةً لِلسَّمَاءِ وَرُجُومًا لِلشَّيَاطِينِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatada said God most high created these (static looking) &lt;strong&gt;stars&lt;/strong&gt; for three purposes; He made them an adornment for the sky, missiles for the devils, and signs by which people find their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId581731&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1st Blunder: Meteoroids are neither stars, nor lamps, nor do they emit light, nor do they beautify the 1st heaven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the Quranic assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The static looking stars, described as lamps in verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/67.5&quot;&gt;67:5&lt;/a&gt;, are &lt;strong&gt;visible &lt;/strong&gt;celestial bodies that adorn the first heaven. But these static stars do not transform into shooting stars as claimed by the Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, shooting stars, known as meteoroids, are small pebble-sized objects that ignite into burning flames only upon entering Earth's atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to their atmospheric entry, meteoroids do travel like missiles towards the earth due to its gravitational power, but without emitting any fire or light or flame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They also don't serve as adornments for the sky; in fact, they remain dark and imperceptible to the naked eye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, meteoroids do not possess the ability to guide people in finding their way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId253982&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2nd Blunder: Even Meteoroids never pursue or chase anything, such as devils, but instead, they merely follow the gravitational path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/15.16?context=3&quot;&gt;15:16-18&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And We have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers. And We have protected it from every devil accursed. &lt;em&gt;Except one who steals a hearing and is &lt;strong&gt;chased&lt;/strong&gt; away by &lt;strong&gt;a clear burning flame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5&quot;&gt;37:6-10&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, We have adorned (lowest of 7 heavens, i.e.) the heaven of Earth (Arabic:  السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا) with an adornment of stars. And (to) guard against every devil rebellious, [So] they may not listen to the exalted assembly [of angels] and are pelted from every side. Repelled; and for them is a constant punishment. &lt;em&gt;Except one who snatches [some words] by theft, but they are &lt;strong&gt;pursued&lt;/strong&gt; by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a burning flame&lt;/em&gt;, piercing [in brightness].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these Quranic verses are indeed accurate, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, an angel must specifically aim at the devils while throwing the meteors towards them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, pursuing or chasing an escaping devil like a missile also implies that the burning flame should have the ability to change its path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Quran is mistaken in this regard, as even meteors never alter their path. They solely follow the gravity of the earth and adhere to the laws of physics, travelling in a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId834576&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Science can already foretell in advance when (on what date and at what time) the devils will steal the so-called command of Allah from the 1st heaven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the following news (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/eta-aquarid-meteor-shower-see-23866858&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 50 shooting stars an hour are expected to light up the night sky during the Eta Aquarid meteor shower. The dazzling display takes place between April 19 and May 28 but will peak this year on Friday (May 6) ... Experts at Royal Observatory Greenwich say the best time to catch a glimpse of the celestial display – which will be visible all over the world – will be between midnight and dawn on Friday ... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, scientists can now predict in advance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specific date and time when the devils will supposedly steal the so-called command of Allah from the 1st heaven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can also anticipate the &quot;rate of stealing,&quot; i.e., how many devils will allegedly steal the commands of Allah per hour (up to 50 shooting stars an hour during the Eta Aquarid meteor shower).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies that modern scientists seemingly possess knowledge of the future, paralleling Allah's omniscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just hope that Muslims can realize how ridiculous the Quranic story about devils and shooting stars has become in the light of modern science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId807076&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3rd Blunder: The Quran implies that the 1st Heaven of Earth is merely 62 miles away from Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Quran, when devils attempt to eavesdrop on the assembly of angels to hear the commands of Allah, they are struck with shooting stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern science has demonstrated that meteoroids only ignite upon entering Earth's atmosphere from space. Since space begins approximately 62 miles above Earth's surface, it suggests that the 1st Heaven is situated within this distance of 62 miles according to the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/72.8?context=2&quot;&gt;72:8-9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Jinns said] We sought to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;touch the heaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but we found it filled (with) guards severe, and burning flames. And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: If scientists are not blind, they have not observed any solid heaven as the Quran and Ahadith claim, positioned only 62 miles away. Additionally, they have not witnessed the assembly of angels, nor have they seen Adam laughing and weeping, or the descendants of Adam there. Refer to the following Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:163&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 163&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ... Gabriel ascended with me to the heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven (i.e. the heaven of the earth), Gabriel said to the guardian of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied. It is Gabriel. He again asked who is there with you. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes. Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. &lt;em&gt;When he looked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept.&lt;/em&gt; He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: &lt;em&gt;He is Adam (peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It casts doubt on the credibility of the Quran's writer, who narrated fictional tales to impress the people of that era when knowledge was limited, thinking no one could verify or refute his stories about shooting stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId703226&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4th Blunder: Contradiction in the Quran regarding the distance of the 1st heaven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the Quran's writer claimed that shooting star incidents occur in the 1st heaven, implying that it is 62 miles away from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the other hand, the same writer also asserted that all stars are positioned under the 1st heaven, placed by Allah to adorn this lowest heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5&quot;&gt;37:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, We (Allah) have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern science, however, has exposed this contradiction in the Quran, proving that stars are actually located billions of light-years away from Earth, which also then automatically mean that the 1st heaven is also billions of light years away from the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We urge Muslims to contemplate this apparent inconsistency in the Quran, if the 1st heave is 62 miles away, or billions of light years away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId63063&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5th Blunder: Devils create a ladder by standing on each other's shoulders to reach the 1st heaven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This so-called Sahih Hadith presents an absurd account where Muhammad claims that devils ascend to the 1st heaven by forming a ladder of sorts, with the uppermost devil stealing the command of Allah and passing it down the chain to the lowest devil on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4800&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4800&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Prophet said, &quot;When Allah decrees some order in the heaven, the angels flutter their wings indicating complete surrender to His saying which sounds like chains being dragged on rock. And when the state of fear disappears, they ask each other, &quot;What has your Lord ordered? They say that He has said that which is true and just, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.&quot; (34.23). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then the stealthy listeners (devils) hear this order, and these stealthy listeners are like this, one over the other [i.e. standing upon the shoulders of each other and making a ladder].&quot; Sufyan, a sub-narrator demonstrated that by holding his hand upright and separating the fingers. A stealthy listener hears a word which he will convey to that which is below him and the second will convey it to that which is below him till the last of them will convey it to the wizard or foreteller.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sometimes a flame (fire) may strike the devil before he can convey it, and sometimes he may convey it before the flame (fire) strikes him&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, whereupon the wizard adds to that word a hundred lies. The people will then say, 'Didn't he (i.e. magician) tell such-and-such a thing on such-and-such date?' So that magician is said to have told the truth because of the Statement which has been heard from the heavens.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; According to the Quran, the 1st heaven is located billions of light-years away from Earth, as all stars exist under the 1st heaven to beautify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Muhammad's account states that devils can reach this faraway 1st heaven by merely standing on each other's shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is highly implausible for any rational person in this modern scientific era to believe in such a ridiculous fairytale promoted by Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Hadith becomes even more absurd when it claims that the missiles struck by Allah's orders sometimes miss their targets, allowing the devil to successfully hear and then pass on Allah's commands to the devil below him. But the question is h&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;ow can infallible angels miss their target? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologists may argue that the Quran and Hadith are not books of science, but the question remains: Why do Allah and Muhammad present completely false scientific facts in them if they are not meant to be taken as scientific truths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId812278&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;6th Blunder: Only after the prophethood of Muhammad, devils were started to be hit by shooting stars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand why the writer of the Quran, who we believe to be Muhammad himself, fabricated the story of shooting stars and devils. It seems, there were 2 main reasons which compelled Muhammad to make this story: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, people were doubting Muhammad, as he claimed in the Quran that ONLY Allah knows UNSEEN. But then there was a contradiction in the Quran that soothsayers were able to tell Moses about the future unseen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, despite claiming prophethood and receiving news of the future and the unseen from Allah, people still sought the services of soothsayers to inquire about the future, offering them money and sacrifices to gain knowledge about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad desired to monopolize the domain of future knowledge and unseen events by discrediting soothsayers. To achieve this, he invented a narrative stating that soothsayers could indeed foretell the future in the past, as devils used to steal news, and then bring them news from the 1st heaven. However, after Muhammad's prophethood, this practice ceased, and Allah began to hit the devils with shooting stars whenever they tried to eavesdrop on His commands in the 1st heaven. Muhammad cited Quran 72:8-9 as evidence of this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/72.8?context=2&quot;&gt;72:8-9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Jinns said] We sought to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;touch the heaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but we found it filled (with) guards severe, and burning flames. And&lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;we used to sit therein (in the past)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in positions for hearing, but whoever listens &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. after the prophethood of Muhammad) will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By crafting this story, Muhammad successfully undermined the significance of soothsayers and their ability to predict the future. However, this story created another issue. If shooting stars were not used for hitting the devils before Muhammad's prophethood, what purpose did the transformation of stars into burning flames (shooting stars) serve during that time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad, or the writer of the Quran, never addressed this question during his lifetime, perhaps unable to provide a satisfactory explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later generations of Muslims were also unable to present any conclusive evidence to support this claim. Ibn Kathir attempted to provide an argument in his Tafsir (under verse 72:8), suggesting that incidents of shooting stars (meteors) occurred before Muhammad's prophethood, but they were infrequent  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quran4u.com/Tafsir%20Ibn%20Kathir/072%20Jinn.htm&quot;&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir, under verse 72:8&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be that shooting stars (meteors) occurred before this (i.e. the prophethood of Muhammad), however it did not happen much, rather only occasionally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every sane person can see that the argument of Ibn Kathir is nothing more than a lame excuse and a lie. There is no proof that incidents of meteors occurred only occasionally before Muhammad, and their rate increased after his prophethood. Meteors were falling all over the world, and none of the people of that era in the rest of the world noted any increase in the rate of meteors after the prophethood of Muhammad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seventh Blunder: Iblis and His Entire Nation of Satans Were &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;Unaware&lt;/span&gt; of the Prophethood of Muhammad and existence of the Muslims &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;for Many Years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Islamic story, there was initially only one Iblis devil (i.e. Lucifer). But a question arose: how could this single Iblis devil reach millions of people around the world at every moment and tempt them all simultaneously? So, what is the difference then between Iblis and Allah, as both are present all over at the same time? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, the Islamic story added to it that Iblis is not like Allah, he cannot be present all over at the same time, and there also exist &quot;small devils/Jinns&quot;, who work for IBLIS (i.e. LUCIFER). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note: There is no concept of 'jinn' in the Bible of Jews and Christians. Muhammad copied this concept from his own pre-Islamic Arab culture, where Jinns were present. Reference: &lt;span class=&quot;x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xzsf02u&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/jinni&quot;&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/jinni&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xzsf02u&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Muhammad narrated a strange story, according to which neither Iblis nor small devils were aware of existence of Muhammad, his prophethood and the Muslims for many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:449&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 449&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn 'Abbas reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) neither recited the Qur'an to the Jinn nor did he see them. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out with some of his Companions with the intention of going to the bazaar of 'Ukaz And there had been (at that time) obstructions between satans and the news from the Heaven, and there were flung flames upon them. So satan went back to their people and they said: What has happened to you? They said: There have been created obstructions between us and the news from the Heaven. And there have been flung upon us flames. &lt;strong&gt;They said: It cannot happen but for some (important) event. So traverse the eastern parts of the earth and the western parts and find out why is it that there have been created obstructions between us and the news from the Heaven. So they went forth and traversed the easts of the earth and its wests. Some of them proceeded towards Tihama and that is a nakhl towards the bazaar of 'Ukaz and he (the Holy Prophet) was leading his Companions in the morning prayer. So when they heard the Qur'an. they listened to it attentively and said: It is this which has caused obstruction between us and news from the Heaven. They went back to their people and said: O our people, we have heard a strange Qur'an which directs us to the right path; so we affirm our faith in it and we would never associate anyone with our Lord.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also look at this hadith, where Iblis is himself unawre of Muhammad and Muslims for many years: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3324&quot;&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi, Hadith 3324&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
Ibn Abbas said: “The jinns used to ascent through the heavens, trying to listen about the Revelation. So when they heard a statement, they would add nine to it. The statement that they heard would be true, while what they added was false. So it was with the advent of the Messenger of Allah that they were prevented from their places. So they mentioned that to &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iblis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – and the stars were not shot at them before that. &lt;em&gt;So Iblis said to them: ‘This is naught but an event that has occurred in the earth.’ So he sent out his armies, and they found the Messenger of Allah standing in Salat between two mountains” – I think he said “in Makkah” – “So they (returned) to meet with him (Iblis), and informed him. He said: ‘This is the event that has happened on the earth.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; (Darussalam)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Muhammad asserted that after the shooting stars began striking the Jinns, some of them came to him and embraced Islam under his guidance. Through this narrative, Muhammad aimed to further elevate his significance and instill greater fear in the hearts of his followers by implying that even jinn were under his control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the tale became highly implausible, as it implied that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No devil was present in Mecca for many years since none of them were aware of Muhammad's prophethood and existence of the Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This would imply that during all those years, the pagans of Mecca were free from committing any sin, as no devils were present in Mecca to mislead them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can any rational person believe such an implausible story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that when trying to cover up one lie, many more are often needed, and this narrative of Iblis' ignorance about Muhammad's prophethood for several years seems to be one such attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId209155&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;8th Blunder: The false Challenge of Allah that humans (and Jinns) cannot cross the regions of heavens and EARTH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Quranic verses 55:33-35, Allah challenges the jinn and mankind, daring them to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the Earth without His permission. The text suggests that those who try will be met with a flame of fire and smoke that they cannot defend against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran 55:33-35:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O company of jinn and mankind,&lt;strong&gt; if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass&lt;/strong&gt;. You will not pass except by authority/permission [from Allah] ... &lt;strong&gt;There will be sent upon you a &lt;em&gt;flame of fire (i.e. meteor) and smoke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and you will not be able to defend yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to reach the heavens and encounter God is a recurring theme in various cultures and historical accounts, and the Quran also presents a story about Pharaoh's ambitious endeavor to construct a tower reaching the heavens. In Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/28.38&quot;&gt;28:38&lt;/a&gt; and Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/40.37&quot;&gt;40:36-37&lt;/a&gt;, it is narrated that Pharaoh instructed his minister Haman to build such a structure, hoping to challenge the divine authority of Moses' God. And there were also many stories in earlier civilizations that Pharaoh indeed reached near heaven. Imam Qurtabi recorded one such story in his commentary of this verse 28:38 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;amp;tSoraNo=28&amp;amp;tAyahNo=38&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As-Suddi reported that Pharaoh climbed upon the tower and threw an arrow towards the sky, so it came down stained with blood. So Pharaoh said, 'I killed the God of Moosa (Moses).' It was reported that when Pharaoh said this, Allaah sent down Jibreel who struck the tower with his wing and cut it into three pieces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) challenged that nobody can cross the regions of heaven and the earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, contrary to Allah's claim, non-Muslims, atheists, and Hindus, who all deny Allah, have already crossed the regions of the Earth without His permission, and no flame of fire or smoke has stopped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Quranic verse (which is threatening humans &amp;amp; Jinns with &lt;strong&gt;flame of fire and smoke&lt;/strong&gt;) seems to have a connection to the story in other parts of the Quran, where devils attempt to sit in the 1st heaven, and stars transform into &lt;strong&gt;flames of fire (i.e. meteors)&lt;/strong&gt; to chase and attack them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId349922&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muslim Excuse: These are not meteors, but the &lt;em&gt;Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays, which&lt;/em&gt; are used to shoot down the devils by Allah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Muslim apologists sometimes claim that these challenges involve &quot;Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.answering-christianity.com/shooting_stars_miracle.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) used by Allah to shoot down devils. However, this excuse has no basis in the original Quranic claim, for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Guided Pulsar Gamma Rays&quot; are not guided; they disperse in all directions and are invisible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These gamma rays do not resemble burning flames of fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quran and Hadith specifically mention shooting stars (meteors) as the means to hit devils, not any form of invisible gamma rays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Shooting_Stars_and_Eavesdropping_Shaytans&quot;&gt;Shooting Stars and Eavesdropping Shaytans in earlier Cultures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot;&gt;Moreover, t&lt;span&gt;he idea of shooting stars chasing away eavesdropping devils may have Jewish roots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Testament of Solomon:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The firmament is conceived in a tripartite structure and demons are portrayed as being capable of flying up to and past the firmament in order to eavesdrop on the decisions of God. (Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testament_of_Solomon&quot;&gt;Testament of Solomon - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Babylonian Talmud, demons are described as having some angelic qualities, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mt-md block&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;They know what will be in the future like ministering angels. The Gemara is puzzled by this last statement: Should it enter your mind that they know this? Not even the angels are privy to the future. Rather, they hear from behind the curtain when God reveals something of the future, like ministering angels.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, even a single scientific mistake in the Quran is significant, as it challenges the notion of 100%  Allah's perfection and cast doubt on the authenticity of the entire Islamic belief system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Muhammad and the Quran, there is a belief that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ocean of sweet water exists above the seven heavens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This sweet water of rain falls from that ocean above the heavens onto the Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the same ocean upon which the throne of Allah rests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, there are mountains of snow in the heavens, from which Allah sends hail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This portrayal aligns with a Flat Earth model, where the seven heavens are envisioned as a canopy above the flat Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that Muhammad seemingly adopted this model of rain and the flat Earth from the Bible, which, in turn, have drawn inspiration from earlier civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId970176&quot;&gt;Concept of CLOUDS and Rain Model in Muhammad's mind&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId877798&quot;&gt;1st Deception from Islamic apologists: Word SKY (السماء) also means 'atmosphere' or 'from above' &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId97358&quot;&gt;2nd Deception from Islamic apologists: Word السماء also means Clouds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId655873&quot;&gt;Concept of Hails in Muhammad's mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId623638&quot;&gt;Source of sweet water of the Nile and Euphrates in Muhammad's mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId235256&quot;&gt;The 1st Heaven of Earth is only 62 miles away from Earth in Muhammad's mind&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId996932&quot;&gt;Contradiction in Quran regarding how far away the 1st heaven is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId369298&quot;&gt;The false Challenge of Allah that humans (and Jinns) cannot cross the regions of heavens and EARTH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId985168&quot;&gt;The concept of the western and the eastern ends of the Flat Earth being extremely HOT in Muhammad's mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId176196&quot;&gt;Hadith of Sun Rising between the Devil's Horns also proves that the Earth was Flat in Muhammad's mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId284755&quot;&gt;Solar and lunar eclipses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId711134&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sweet rainwater comes directly from sweet water ocean in the heavens, upon which Allah's throne is resting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a sweet water ocean above the heavens was present in Muhammad's understanding, as described in the Quran. Muhammad claimed that two oceans, one with salty water and the other with sweet water, do not mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/25.53&quot;&gt;25:53&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى مَرَجَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ هَٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخًا وَحِجْرًا مَّحْجُورًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is He who has released [simultaneously] the two seas, one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter, and He placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how is it possible, while there exists no ocean on the earth which has &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sweet water?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanation for this lies in the cosmological model that Muhammad and earlier civilizations, such as those mentioned in the Bible or Sumerian and Akkadian civilizations, had in mind—a model that included the presence of a sweet water ocean above the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various verses in the Quran and Ahadith start aligning perfectly with this cosmological model when we understand the presence of a sweet water ocean in Muhammad's mind. For instance, Muhammad stated that Allah's throne was resting upon the water, a story he borrowed from the Bible. This connection can be seen in the verses from the Quran (11:7) and the corresponding passage from Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/11.7&quot;&gt;11:7&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ &lt;strong&gt;وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلْمَآءِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and &lt;strong&gt;His Throne was upon the water&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad copied this story from Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of th&lt;span id=&quot;marker1990108&quot; class=&quot;offset-marker&quot; data-offset=&quot;1831452&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;e waters ... And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; under the firmament from the waters which &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background: #ffffff; color: #005ec3 !important; text-decoration: none; outline: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman', times, serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&quot; href=&quot;https://biblia.com/books/kjv1900/Ge1&quot; rel=&quot;popup&quot; data-resourcename=&quot;kjv1900&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;resourcetext&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;lang-en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a data-reference=&amp;quot;Ps148.4&amp;quot; data-datatype=&amp;quot;bible+kjv&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;/reference/Ps148.4?resourceName=kjv1900&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;bibleref&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;vertical-align:normal&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Ps 148:4 &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;above the firmament ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters.&lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ... Then God said, “Let there be a space between the waters, to separate the waters of the heavens from the waters of the earth.” And that is what happened. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;God made this space to separate the waters of the earth from the waters of the heavens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Then God said, “Let the waters beneath the sky flow together into one place, so dry ground (i.e. the Earth) may appear.” And that is what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) continued this fantasy story in the following verse too, where he is claiming that He (i.e. Allah) sent down water from the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/23.18&quot;&gt;23:18&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءًۢ بِقَدَرٍ فَأَسْكَنَّٰهُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ ۖ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ذَهَابٍۭ بِهِۦ لَقَٰدِرُونَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Pickthall) And we send &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;down from the sky water (i.e. rain) in measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and We give it lodging in the earth, and lo! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are also Able to withdraw this water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Maududi) We sent down water from the sky in right measure, and caused it to stay in the earth, and We have the power&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to cause this water to vanish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sahih International) And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth. And indeed, &lt;strong&gt;We are Able to take it away&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please reflect upon these words in this verse: &quot;... &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We can also &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;withdraw/vanish/take it away&lt;/span&gt; this water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot; &lt;/em&gt;when referring to the water sent down from the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem arises from the fact that during the Flood of Noah, a significant amount of rainwater from this same sweet water ocean above the heavens fell, and it has continued to do so with each rainfall thereafter. Theoretically, this constant rainfall from the heavenly ocean should have flooded the Earth. To avert this, the Quranic writer had to include the notion of withdrawing or vanishing this rainwater to save the Earth from a flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible also faces the same question regarding excessive water from the heavens. The rainwater falls directly from the heavenly ocean, leading to inquiries about what happens to the surplus water. The Bible suggests that it stays on Earth, as stated in Isaiah 55:10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm&quot;&gt;(Isaiah 55:10)&lt;/a&gt;: For as the&lt;strong&gt; rain and the snow come down (directly) from heaven and do not return there (i.e. back to heaven) but water the earth&lt;/strong&gt;, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Please also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/passage/?q=1+kings+8:35-36&quot;&gt;1 Kings 8:35&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/7-13.html&quot;&gt;2 Chronicles 7:13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the stories about rainwater during Noah's flood are also similar in both the Bible and the Quran, with references to the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;opening of gates or windows in the heavens&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://christiananswers.net/bible/gen7.html#11&quot;&gt;Bible, Genesis 7:11&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;windows of heaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; were opened (for rain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.11&quot;&gt;54:11&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;فَفَتَحْنَآ أَبْوَٰبَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَآءٍ مُّنْهَمِرٍ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then We opened the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the heaven with rain pouring down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that the understanding presented in the Quran and the Bible regarding the origin and behavior of rainwater is scientifically incorrect. In reality, rainwater does not come from the heavens but is a result of the water cycle, where water on Earth vaporizes, forms clouds, and then precipitates as rain. Water does not disappear or vanish but undergoes changes in form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId594445&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Barrier between the Salty Water of Earth's Ocean and the Sweet Water of Heavens' Ocean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/Islamic_cosmology_salt_sweet_ocean.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Barrier between the Salty Water of Earth's Ocean and the Sweet Water of Heavens' Ocean&quot; width=&quot;740&quot; height=&quot;795&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/Islamic_cosmology_salt_sweet_ocean.jpg&quot; class=&quot;float-none&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon revisiting the verse that mentions two oceans of salty and sweet water, we can now perceive how it aligns with the cosmological model incorporating a sweet water ocean above the heavens. This perspective allows the verse to find coherence and relevance within this framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/25.53&quot;&gt;25:53&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى مَرَجَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ هَٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخًا وَحِجْرًا مَّحْجُورًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is He who has released [simultaneously] the two seas, one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter, and He placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the commentary of this verse, the Sahaba (companions) also referred to the existence of the two oceans—one in heaven and one on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tafsir al-Qurtabi (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;amp;tSoraNo=25&amp;amp;tAyahNo=53&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;Commentary of Verse 25:53&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقال ابن عباس وابن جبير: يعني بحر السماء وبحر الأرض  قال ابن عباس: يلتقيان في كل عام وبينهما برزخ قضاء من قضائه. { وَحِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً } حراماً محرّماً أن يعذب هذا الملح بالعذب، أو يملح هذا العذب بالملح.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Abbas and Ibn Jubayr said: It refers to the ocean of the sky and the ocean of the earth. Ibn Abbas further explained: They meet each other every year, and between them is a barrier decreed by Allah. &quot;And a barrier between them is forbidden to be crossed.&quot; It is forbidden for the salty water to mix with the sweet water or for the sweet water to become salty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir recorded from Rab'i bin Anas, under the commentary of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=11&amp;amp;tAyahNo=7&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;11:7&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقال الربيع بن أنس : ( وكان عرشه على الماء ) فلما خلق السموات والأرض ، قسم ذلك الماء قسمين ، فجعل نصفا تحت العرش ، وهو البحر المسجور .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ar-Rabi' ibn Anas said: &quot;And His Throne was upon the water.&quot; So when He created the heavens and the earth, He divided that water into two parts, and He placed one half beneath the Throne, and that is the ocean that is known as &quot;Behr-al-Masjoor&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quranic verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=52&amp;amp;tAyahNo=6&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;52:6&lt;/a&gt; again mentions this &quot;Behr-e-Masjoor&quot; (i.e. water under the Throne of Allah), and Ibn Kathir recorded again from Rab'i bin Anas (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=52&amp;amp;tAyahNo=6&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قال الربيع بن أنس : هو الماء الذي تحت العرش ، الذي ينزل [ الله ] منه المطر الذي يحيي به الأجساد في قبورها يوم معادها . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rab'i bin Anas said: This is the water which is present under the Throne of Allah, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from which Allah sends down the (sweet) rainwater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And this same water will be used to make dead people become alive on the day of judgement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do remember that Islamic apologists make an excuse that the Quran is mentioning in this verse the meeting of two oceans of the earth. But their excuse is wrong, as there is not a single ocean in this world which has sweet water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Ibn Juraij (an exegete and &lt;a title=&quot;Hadith&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith&quot;&gt;hadith&lt;/a&gt; transmitter from the &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Taba' at-Tabi'in&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taba%27_at-Tabi%27in&quot;&gt;Taba' at-Tabi'in)&lt;/a&gt; became confused and said (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=25&amp;amp;tAyahNo=53&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; قال ابن جُرَيج: فلـم أجد بحراً عذبـاً إلا الأنهار العذاب&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not seen any ocean having sweet water. Only rivers have sweet water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists also attempt to present a new justification, suggesting that the verse refers to one ocean (of salty water) and one 'river' (of sweet water). However, this excuse lacks validity since the Quran explicitly uses the term &quot;al-bahrain, ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ&quot; meaning 'two oceans.' Therefore, it is not plausible to interpret this term as referring to one ocean and one river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;Furthermore, the inclusion of a sweet water ocean above the heavens in Muhammad's cosmological model provides evidence that &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Muhammad perceived the Earth to be flat.&lt;/span&gt; This concept cannot be reconciled with any spherical Earth model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId970176&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Cloud Model in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of the Quran, Muhammad, lacked knowledge about the water cycle. He shared the prevailing understanding of his time, which stated that rainwater originated from the sweet water ocean above the heavens. According to this belief, the &quot;Rain Model&quot; is as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rainwater was believed to originate from a sweet water ocean located above the heavens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rainwater was thought to descend from the seventh sky to the lowest first sky (of our world).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, according to this belief, the &quot;Cloud Model&quot; is as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The clouds are situated where the end corners of the 7 heavens meet each other. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then Allah sends winds that would carry the clouds to the lowest first sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the lowest sky, the clouds then absorb the rainwater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially, the clouds are present &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;as a unified entity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the place where the 7 skies meet each other.  They stay as this unified entity till they absorb water from the lowest first sky. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, only after that, Allah would break the clouds into fragments and scatter them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rain would fall in specific places as determined by Allah's will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are proofs of the Model of Clouds in Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/30.48&quot;&gt;30:48&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى يُرْسِلُ ٱلرِّيَٰحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَابًا فَيَبْسُطُهُۥ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ وَيَجْعَلُهُۥ كِسَفًا فَتَرَى ٱلْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلَٰلِهِۦ ۖ فَإِذَآ أَصَابَ بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦٓ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah (is) the One Who sends the winds, so they raise (the) clouds, then He spreads them in the sky, how He wills, and He makes them &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fragments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; so you see the rain coming forth from their midst. Then when He causes it to fall on whom He wills of His slaves, behold! They rejoice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddi said under the commentary of this verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=30&amp;amp;tAyahNo=48&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن السدي رضي الله عنه قال: يرسل الله الريح فتأتي بالسحاب من بين الخافقين - طرف السماء حين يلتقيان - فتخرجه ثم تنشره فيبسطه في السماء كيف يشاء،  فيسيل الماء على السحاب، ثم يمطر السحاب بعد ذلك.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated by As-Suddi, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: &quot;Allah sends the wind, and it brings the clouds from between the edges - the meeting point - of the sky (خافين). Then He brings them forth and spreads them in the sky as He wills. The water flows within the clouds, and then the clouds rain afterwards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Qatada said under the commentary of this verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=30&amp;amp;tAyahNo=48&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن قتادة رضي الله عنه في قوله { فيبسطه في السماء } قال: يجمعه ويجعله { كسفا } قال: قطعاً.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatada said about the verse { فيبسطه في السماء } that Allah first gathers these clouds at one place, and { كسفا } means he then scatters them in fragments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi%27un&quot;&gt;Tabi'un &lt;/a&gt;(i.e. 2nd generation of Muslims after Sahaba), we have recorded traditions that rain comes directly from the sweet water ocean, which is above the 7th heaven (upon which the throne of Allah is resting). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tafsir Durr-e-Manthur (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=2&amp;amp;tAyahNo=22&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن الحسن. أنه سئل المطر من السماء أم من السحاب؟ قال: من السماء، إنما السحاب علم ينزل عليه الماء من السماء.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the authority of Al-Hasan, he was asked, &quot;Does the rain come from the sky or from the clouds?&quot; He replied, &quot;From the sky. The clouds are a sign that the water will descend upon them from the sky.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن كعب قال: السحاب غربال المطر، ولولا السحاب حين ينزل الماء من السماء لأفسد ما يقع عليه من الأرض، والبذر ينزل من السماء.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the authority of Ka'b, he said, &quot;Clouds are the sieves of rain. If it were not for the clouds when the water descends from the sky, it would ruin everything it falls upon on the Earth. And hails (of snow) are also sent down from the sky.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن خالد بن معدان قال: المطر ماء يخرج من تحت العرش، فينزل من سماء إلى سماء حيث يجمع في السماء الدنيا، فيجتمع في موضع يقال له الايرم، فتجيء السحاب السود، فتدخله فتشربه مثل شرب الاسفنجة، فيسوقها الله حيث يشاء.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the authority of Khalid ibn Ma'dan, he said, &quot;Rain is water that comes out from beneath the Throne, descending from one sky to another, where it gathers in the lower sky. It then converges in a place known as Al-A'ram. The dark clouds approach and enter it, consuming the water like a sponge. Then Allah drives them wherever He wills.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن عكرمة قال: ينزل الماء من السماء السابعة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Ikrama said: Rainwater descends from the 7th heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since rainwater comes from the 7th heaven in Muhammad's mind (which is closer to the throne of Allah), thus Muhammad declared that rainwater is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;blessed&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; while it was present near Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:898&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 898&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anas (b. Malik) reported: It rained upon us as we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) removed his cloth (from a part of his body) till the rain fell on it. We said: Messenger of Allah, why did you do this? He said: It is because it (is blessed while it)&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;has just come &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;from the Exalted Lord (i.e. from heavens, where the throne of Allah is present)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the claim made by the writer of the Quran that clouds start as one entity and then become fragmented is scientifically incorrect. In reality, when water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it undergoes condensation, forming small, transparent cloud fragments. As more clouds gather in one area, they begin to appear as white-colored clouds. With further concentration of white clouds in the same region, they can develop into dark-colored clouds, from which rainfall eventually occurs. This process demonstrates that clouds start as fragmented entities and can gradually combine to form larger cloud formations before precipitation takes place. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/#:%7E:text=The%20Short%20Answer%3A,are%20floating%20in%20the%20air.&amp;amp;text=These%20energetic%20molecules%20then%20escape,in%20the%20form%20of%20gas.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it appears that Muhammad also borrowed the &quot;Cloud Model&quot; from the Bible. In Jeremiah 10:13, it is mentioned that God makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth, accompanied by thunder, rain, and wind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 10:13&lt;/a&gt;) When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he makes clouds rise (towards sky)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ends of the earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wind from his &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;storehouses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm&quot;&gt;Psalm 135:7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) He it is who makes the clouds rise &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at the end of the earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind from his &lt;strong&gt;storehouses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, a&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;ccording to the bible, clouds are stored at the ends of the earth, whereas according to the ٰIslam, they are stored between the corners of the skies where they meet each other. Thus, according to both of them, clouds are stored at almost the same places that are beyond the reach of people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/cloud_model_Islam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Model of Clouds: Islam vs The Bible&quot; width=&quot;702&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/cloud_model_Islam.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Moreover, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;According to the bible, God sends the wind from his '&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;storehouses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;' (&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 10:13&lt;/a&gt;). And it is the same in the Quran too that Allah sends winds from the &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;storehouses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Quran: &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamawakened.com/quran/15/21/&quot;&gt;16:21-22&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلَّا عِندَنَا &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;خَزَآئِنُهُۥ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَمَا نُنَزِّلُهُۥٓ إِلَّا بِقَدَرٍ مَّعْلُومٍ &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;وَأَرْسَلْنَا ٱلرِّيَٰحَ لَوَٰقِحَ فَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَسْقَيْنَٰكُمُوهُ وَمَآ أَنتُمْ لَهُۥ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;بِخَٰزِنِينَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;And there is not a thing but that with Us are its &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;storehouses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and We do not send it down except according to a known measure. And We send the winds fertilising, and cause water to descend from the sky, and give it you to drink. It is not ye who are the holders of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; thereof.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm&quot;&gt;Bible, Psalm 135:7&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;treasuries (storehouses)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Sumerian culture also had the same basic model of cosmology and rain as the Bible and Islam have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tqmH3B80WW4/Tz6LYwjKWzI/AAAAAAAABPE/4WcL0VeUd9c/s1600/sumerian.jpg&quot; width=&quot;517&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; class=&quot;float-none&quot; alt=&quot;Cosmology in  Sumerian culture &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId877798&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Exposing the Deception: Misinterpretation of the Word &quot;Sky&quot; (ٱلسَّمَاء) by Islamic Apologists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to address the widespread false propaganda propagated by Islamic apologists, who have successfully indoctrinated both Muslims and non-Muslims into believing that the term &quot;sky&quot; (ٱلسَّمَاء) in the Quran can also mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clouds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the Quran mentions the descent of rainwater from the heavens in the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.22&quot;&gt;2:22&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ فِرَٰشًا وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بِنَآءً&lt;strong&gt; وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who has made the earth your couch, and the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;heavens ٱلسَّمَآ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; your &lt;strong&gt;canopy&lt;/strong&gt;; and sent down &lt;strong&gt;rain&lt;/strong&gt; from the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;heavens ٱلسَّمَآ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern Islamic apologists deceitfully claim that the term 'sky' (ٱلسَّمَاءَ) in the Quran can also signify '&lt;strong&gt;atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;' or '&lt;strong&gt;from above&lt;/strong&gt;.' Consequently, they argue that the verse can be interpreted as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;.... and (He) sends down rainwater from the &lt;strong&gt;atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;from above &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; from clouds&lt;/strong&gt;).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the Quranic verse itself provides clarity, leaving no room for the escape of Islamic apologists. The verse utilizes the term 'sky' (ٱلسَّمَاءَ) &lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt;, explicitly conveying that it refers to the heavenly canopy erected by Allah, in contrast to the earthly bed or couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to recognize and refute these deceptions by Islamic apologists, that deviate from the clear meaning conveyed by the Quranic text itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, look at this verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.164&quot;&gt;2.164&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;verse__translation arabic-container&quot; data-translator-code=&quot;AR&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt class=&quot;arabic highlightable&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;إِنَّ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلَٰفِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلَّتِى تَجْرِى فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ ٱلنَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ ٱلرِّيَٰحِ &lt;strong&gt;وَٱلسَّحَابِ&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ &lt;strong&gt;ٱلسَّمَآءِ&lt;/strong&gt; وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;verse__translation arabic-container&quot; data-translator-code=&quot;AR&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt class=&quot;arabic highlightable&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(If they want a sign for the perception of this Reality) surety there are countless signs for those who use their common sense; they can see alternation of the night and day, in the ships that sail the ocean laden with cargoes beneficial to mankind, &lt;strong&gt;and in the rain-water which Allah sends down from the sky&lt;/strong&gt; and thereby gives life to the earth after its death and spreads over it all kinds of animate creatures, in the blowing of the winds &lt;strong&gt;and in the clouds which obediently wait for orders between the sky and the earth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, this verse not only establishes the distinction between clouds and the sky (ٱلسَّمَاء), but it also explicitly clarifies the location of clouds between the earth and the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to acknowledge the gravity of these deceptions propagated by Islamic apologists. Their influence extends far and wide, significantly impacting the beliefs of millions of Muslims who wholeheartedly trust in these misleading interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId188094&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Concept of Thunder and Lightning in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thunder and lightning phenomenon was regarded as a mystery during the time of ignorance, and Muhammad capitalized on this lack of understanding by inventing stories to gain respect and instill fear as someone knowledgeable about the unseen world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, Muhammad fabricated the following narrative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an angel named R'ad who oversees the clouds. And the THUNDER that we hear, it is actually the voice of that angel R'ad which comes when he drives the clouds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, LIGHTNING occurs when the angel R'ad strikes the clouds with his iron whip. Subsequently, Allah employs the lightning as a means to punish those who defy Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/13.13&quot;&gt;13:13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَيُسَبِّحُ ٱلرَّعْدُ بِحَمْدِهِۦ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ مِنْ خِيفَتِهِۦ وَيُرْسِلُ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقَ فَيُصِيبُ بِهَا مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُمْ يُجَٰدِلُونَ فِى ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْمِحَالِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the thunder declares His glory with His praise, and the angels too for awe of Him; and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He sends the thunderbolts and smites with them whom He pleases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, yet they dispute concerning Allah, and He is mighty in prowess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same in the Bible too that God thunders to kill his enemies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/18.html&quot;&gt;Psalm 18:13-14&lt;/a&gt; (NIV&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Lord thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy, with great bolts of lightning &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;he routed them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Muhammad introduced additional elements to this fictional narrative in the following tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal, Hadith 2479 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220818152519/https://web.archive.org/web/20220628135138/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=6&amp;amp;ID=2353&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Abbas said: Once some Jews came to Muhammad and they said: &quot;We will ask you five questions, and if you can answer them correctly, then we will accept that you are the true prophet of God, and we will follow you&quot; ... They asked the fourth question: &quot;What is Thundering of clouds?&quot; Muhammad replied: &quot;There is an angel which Allah stipulated for supervising clouds. He has a whip of iron with which he hits the clouds (due to which lightning is produced), and drives them to go wherever Allah had ordered them to go ... and the thunder is the voice of that angel. Upon that the Jews testified Muhammad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; (authentic) Hadith (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220818152519/https://dorar.net/h/796214dc9b09ef0b46c7f522065e3413&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of ignorance, people had no means to verify or refute such fabricated stories. Consequently, they began to fear Muhammad as a prophet of God and became more compliant to his teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern scientific knowledge has debunked these unfounded tales. Scientific explanations have provided precise reasoning for natural phenomena such as thunder, lightning, earthquakes, and eclipses, contradicting Muhammad's fictional narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId655873&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Model of Hails in Muhammad's Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of ignorance, people commonly observed that snow was found in mountains. This led to the belief that there were &quot;mountains of snow&quot; in the heavens, from which hail accompanied rainwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with this prevailing understanding, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) also incorporated this concept from the time of ignorance into the Quranic verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220627090006/https://daaiyatulislam.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/tafsir-ibn-kathir-surah-24-an-nur.pdf&quot;&gt;24:43&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِنۢ بَرَدٍ فَيُصِيبُ بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَصْرِفُهُۥ عَن مَّن يَشَآءُ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And He sends down hail from the sky, from mountains within it, and it strikes whomever He wills and diverts it from whomever He wills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Qurtabi wrote under the commentary of this verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;amp;tSoraNo=24&amp;amp;tAyahNo=43&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{ وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِن بَرَدٍ } قيل: خلق الله في السماء جبالاً من بَرَد، فهو ينزِّل منها بَرَداً  وفيه إضمار، أي ينزِّل من جبال البرد بَرَدا، فالمفعول محذوف. ونحو هذا قول الفرّاء لأن التقدير عنده: من جبال برد فالجبال عنده هي البرد. و«بَرَدٍ» في موضع خفض ويجب أن يكون على قوله المعنى: من جبالٍ بردٍ فيها، بتنوين جبال. وقيل: إن الله تعالى خلق في السماء جبالاً فيها برد فيكون التقدير: وينزل من السماء من جبال فيها برد.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And He sends down from the sky hail from mountains within it, containing hailstones. It is said that Allah created mountains of hail in the sky, and He sends down hail from them ...  It is also said that Allah created mountains in the sky containing hail, so the intended meaning is: &quot;And He sends down from the sky from mountains within it containing hail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir writes under commentary of this verse 24:43 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220627090006/https://daaiyatulislam.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/tafsir-ibn-kathir-surah-24-an-nur.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;(and He sends down from (&lt;strong&gt;Min&lt;/strong&gt;) the sky, from (&lt;strong&gt;Min&lt;/strong&gt;) mountains in it of (&lt;strong&gt;Min&lt;/strong&gt;) ice,). Some of the grammarians said that the first Min describes the place from which it is coming, the second specifies from which part of the sky it comes, and the third means some kind of mountains. This is based on the view of those scholars of Tafsir who say that, مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِن بَرَدٍ from (Min) mountains in it of (Min) ice, means that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;there are mountains of hail in the sky from which Allah sends down ice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Muhammad copied this concept from the bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm&quot;&gt;Job 38:22&lt;/a&gt;): Hast thou entered into the treasures (storehouses) of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail? [&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/38.htm&quot;&gt;Commentary&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;ital&quot;&gt;the treasures&quot; &lt;/span&gt; That is, the treasuries, the magazines. Snow and hail are represented as having been created and laid up in great storehouses in the heavens or above them]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId623638&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Source of sweet water of the Nile and Euphrates in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3207&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3207&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet (ﷺ) said: .... (On the night of ascension, where he went to heavens) Then I was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and four rivers originated at its root&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, 'The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nile and the Euphrates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2839&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2839:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saihan, Jaihan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Euphrates and Nile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are all among the rivers of Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, these Ahadith have become a challenge and a headache for Islamic apologists as they do not align with any cosmological models. They are unable to provide an answer regarding how the water, which is flowing from the root of a tree in paradise, reaches the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, modern science has already identified the true sources of the sweet water in the Nile and the Euphrates rivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of Muhammad, people lacked knowledge about the true origins of the sweet water in the Nile and the Euphrates rivers. This provided Muhammad with an opportunity to fabricate falsehoods regarding their sources. However, modern science has exposed Muhammad's deceitful claims regarding these rivers' origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this issue is further resolved when we discover a similar story in the Bible, albeit with a slightly different concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:10-2:14&quot;&gt;Genesis 2:10-14&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-41&quot; class=&quot;text Gen-2-10&quot;&gt;A river watering the garden flowed from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; from there it was separated into &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; headwaters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-42&quot; class=&quot;text Gen-2-11&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;The name of the first is the Pishon&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;۔۔۔&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-44&quot; class=&quot;text Gen-2-13&quot;&gt;The name of the second river is the &lt;em&gt;Gihon&lt;/em&gt;; it winds through the entire land of Cush. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-45&quot; class=&quot;text Gen-2-14&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The name of the third river is the &lt;strong&gt;Tigris&lt;/strong&gt;; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the &lt;strong&gt;Euphrates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the biblical story and Muhammad's account is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Bible, the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Garden of Eden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; where Adam and Eve resided, along with the forbidden tree, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;was located on Earth&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore, it was logical for the Bible to state that the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers originated from the Garden of Eden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, Muhammad made an error in his rendition of the story. He claimed that Adam, Eve, and the forbidden tree were situated &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;not on Earth but in paradise in the heavens&lt;/span&gt;. This posed a challenge in explaining how the water from the root of a tree in heaven could reach the earthly rivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad, though he borrowed stories from the Bible, was not an educated scholar and remained largely illiterate. Consequently, he inadvertently made numerous human errors while retelling these ancient narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about the Garden of Eden/Paradise:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden&quot;&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garden of Eden, in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) book of Genesis, &lt;strong&gt;biblical&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;earthly paradise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; inhabited by the first created man and woman, Adam and Eve, prior to their expulsion for disobeying the commands of God...  The term paradise is often used as a synonym for the &lt;a class=&quot;md-crosslink autoxref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden&quot; data-show-preview=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Garden of Eden&lt;/a&gt; before the expulsion of &lt;a class=&quot;md-crosslink autoxref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Adam-and-Eve-biblical-literary-figures&quot; data-show-preview=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Adam and Eve&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId235256&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Concept of the 1st Heaven being 62 miles away from Earth in Muhammad's Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Quran, there are a total of seven heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Quran asserts that when devils attempt to eavesdrop on the heavenly assembly of angels in the 1st heaven of Earth, they are met with burning flames or meteors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern science has demonstrated that meteoroids only ignite once they enter Earth's atmosphere from space. The boundary of space is approximately 62 miles away from our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to the Quran, it suggests that the 1st Heaven is situated approximately 62 miles from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/72.8?context=2&quot;&gt;72:8-9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Jinns said] We sought to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;touch the heaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but we found it filled (with) guards severe, and burning flames. And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame (i.e. meteor) lying in wait for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: Are all scientists blind to not observe any tangible heaven (as described in the Quran and Hadith) just 62 miles away? Nor do they witness any angelic assembly, nor the presence of Adam and his descendants. Please refer to the following Hadith for further reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:163&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 163&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ... Gabriel ascended with me to the heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven (i.e. the heaven of the earth), Gabriel said to the guardian of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied. It is Gabriel. He again asked who is there with you. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes. Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. &lt;em&gt;When he looked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept.&lt;/em&gt; He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: &lt;em&gt;He is Adam (peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these scientists are not blind, it serves as evidence that the author of the Quran was simply fabricating falsehoods to deceive the people of that era. The writer assumed that no one would be able to venture into the sky to verify or refute his accounts of shooting stars, granting him the freedom to narrate fairytales in an attempt to captivate and gain followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId996932&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Contradiction in the Quran: Discrepancy in the Distance of the 1st Heaven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Quran, there exists a contradiction regarding the proximity of the 1st heaven to Earth. On one hand, the writer claims that shooting stars occur in the 1st heaven, indicating its proximity at 62 miles from Earth. However, the same writer also asserts that all the stars are present under the 1st heaven, adorning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5&quot;&gt;37:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, We (Allah) have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses a contradiction, as modern science has demonstrated that stars are actually billions of light years away from our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite Muslims to reflect upon this contradiction presented in the Quran. Islamic apologists may attempt to provide explanations, but our detailed article, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=101&amp;amp;catid=15&quot;&gt;7 Scientific Blunders in the Single Quranic Story of 'Starsng Stars' &lt;/a&gt;&quot;, refutes such excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId369298&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The false Challenge of Allah that Humans (and Jinns) cannot cross the regions of Heavens and EARTH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Quran 55:33-35, Allah presents a challenge to both humans and jinns, asserting that they cannot cross the regions of the heavens and earth without His permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran 55:33-35:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O company of jinn and mankind,&lt;strong&gt; if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass&lt;/strong&gt;. You will not pass except by authority/permission [from Allah] ... There will be sent upon you a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;flame of fire and smoke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and you will not be able to defend yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to Allah's challenge, non-Muslims, atheists, and Hindus, who deny Allah's existence, have already crossed the regions of the Earth without seeking His permission. They have done so without facing any flame of fire or smoke hindering their journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;he writer of the Quran had the same story in his mind, which is also present in other verses of the Quran i.e. when devils try to sit in the 1st heaven, then stars transform into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;flames of fire and chase the devils&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;. Thus, in this verse 55:35 too, he is repeating the same threat i.e. if jinns or humans try to pass beyond the regions of heavens and the earth, then Allah will send a flame of fire and smoke upon them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the writer of the Quran was unaware that this flame of fire is limited to Earth's atmosphere. As a result, in space, there is neither flame nor smoke present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId985168&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The concept of the western and the eastern ends of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat Earth being &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;extremely &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/18.86&quot;&gt;18:86&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِى عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he (i.e. Dhulqarnain) reached the far west, he found the sun setting, he found it setting in a spring of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOT WATER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;/dark mud,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir tells us the reason for the hot water there i.e. it is hot while &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the western edge of FLAT Earth is &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;CLOSER&lt;/span&gt; to the spot where the SUN sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir wrote under the commentary of verse 18:86 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;amp;tAyahNo=86&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وقال ابن جرير والصواب أنهما قراءتان مشهورتان، وأيهما قرأ القارىء فهو مصيب، قلت ولا منافاة بين معنييهما إذ قد تكون حارة لمجاورتها وهج الشمس عند غروبها، وملاقاتها الشعاع بلا حائل&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Jarir said, “There are two well-known recitations (i.e.  the sun disappears in black mud, or the sun disappears in the spring of hot water) and whichever one the reciter recites is correct.” And I (i.e. Ibn Kathir) say, there is no contradiction between their two meanings, as it may be the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;water is hot because it is near the glare of the sun at sunset (i.e. the western edge of the flat earth is closer to sun)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and it meets the rays without a barrier. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Quran also tells the story that the far eastern edge of the flat earth is also hot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/18.90&quot;&gt;18:90&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَطْلِعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَطْلُعُ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ لَّمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُم مِّن دُونِهَا سِتْرًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until, when he (i.e. Dhulqarnain) came to the rising place of the sun (i.e. the far eastern edge of Flat Earth), he found it rising on a people for whom &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We (Allah) had provided no shelter against the sun (i.e. no trees etc. while all of them burnt due to the extreme heat)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir wrote under the commentary of this verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;amp;tAyahNo=90&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=6&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;original-text&quot;&gt; وقال قتادة ذكر لنا أنهم بأرض لا تنبت لهم شيئاً، فهم إذا طلعت الشمس، دخلوا في أسراب، حتى إذا زالت الشمس، خرجوا إلى حروثهم ومعايشهم ...  فقال لهم أهلها لا تطلعن عليكم الشمس وأنتم بها، قالوا لا نبرح حتى تطلع الشمس، ما هذه العظام؟ قالوا هذه جيف جيش طلعت عليهم الشمس ههنا فماتوا، قال فذهبوا هاربين في الأرض.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;original-text&quot;&gt;Qatadah said, &quot;It was mentioned to us that they were in a land &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;where nothing grew (due to heat while it is closer to the place of sun rise)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; so when the sun rose they would go into tunnels&lt;/em&gt; until it had passed its zenith, then they would come out to go about their daily lives and earn themselves a living ... &lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;And once an army came to them, and they (the locals) said to them: “You should not be here when the sun rises.” But they (didn't listen to the locals and) said, “We will not leave until the sun rises. But what type of bones are these that are lying here?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;They (the locals) said, &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the carcasses of an army (which came here before you). The sun rose on them here, and they died.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; Upon hearing that, the army went back from there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;original-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This also proves that Earth was flat in Muhammad's mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId176196&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hadith of &lt;em&gt;Sun Rising between the Devil's Horns&lt;/em&gt; also proves that the &lt;em&gt;Earth was Flat&lt;/em&gt; in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:828b&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 828b&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Do not intend to observe prayer at the time of the rising of the sun nor at its setting, for it rises between the horns of Satan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;According to Muhammad, during sunrise and sunset, he believed that the sun is directly above Satan's head, positioned between his horns. Muhammad further associated non-Muslims' prostration during these times with prostrating to Satan. This assertion can be found in &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/6/358&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 832&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's understanding of the world was rooted in the belief that it was flat, lacking knowledge about the continuous rising and setting of the sun. From his perspective, it seemed plausible that the sun would travel around Satan once, with everyone observing the same phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Muhammad's interpretation reflects his limited understanding at that time, as he was unaware of the scientific reality of the Earth's rotation and the sun's consistent movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId284755&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lack of Understanding in the Qur'an Regarding Eclipses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Qur'an does not display any comprehension of eclipses. This may be attributed to the limited exposure Muhammad had to such phenomena, as the hadith accounts suggest he only witnessed a single solar eclipse, which deeply unsettled him and led to an extraordinary display of devotion. Surprisingly, the Qur'an mentions eclipses only once, referring to a lunar eclipse that is predicted to occur at the end of the world. Interestingly, the Qur'an contains a statement that could be perceived as contradictory to the occurrence of eclipses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/36.40?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 36:40&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon, nor can the Night outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a solar eclipse to occur, however, the sun and the moon actually must (from the perspective of the earth) &quot;catch up&quot; to each other in their &quot;orbits.&quot; But since the moon itself is not visible at that time, the authors of the Qur'an never noticed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, when discussing the end of time, the Qur'an assumes that a lunar eclipse (which can only occur when the sun and moon are on opposite sides of the earth) can occur at the same time that the sun and moon finally do “catch up” to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qur'an &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/75.6-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;75:6-9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;He asketh: “When will be this Day of Resurrection?” But when sight is confounded. And the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moon is eclipsed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sun and moon are united&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “uniting” of the sun and the moon not only demonstrates a singular instance when they do “catch up” with each other but suggests that its author assumed the common perception that the sun and moon are of comparable size and distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Cosmology_of_the_Quran#Solar_and_lunar_eclipses&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Muhammad and the Quran, there is a belief that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ocean of sweet water exists above the seven heavens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This sweet water of rain falls from that ocean above the heavens onto the Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the same ocean upon which the throne of Allah rests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, there are mountains of snow in the heavens, from which Allah sends hail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This portrayal aligns with a Flat Earth model, where the seven heavens are envisioned as a canopy above the flat Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that Muhammad seemingly adopted this model of rain and the flat Earth from the Bible, which, in turn, have drawn inspiration from earlier civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId711134&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sweet rainwater comes directly from sweet water ocean in the heavens, upon which Allah's throne is resting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a sweet water ocean above the heavens was present in Muhammad's understanding, as described in the Quran. Muhammad claimed that two oceans, one with salty water and the other with sweet water, do not mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/25.53&quot;&gt;25:53&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى مَرَجَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ هَٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخًا وَحِجْرًا مَّحْجُورًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is He who has released [simultaneously] the two seas, one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter, and He placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how is it possible, while there exists no ocean on the earth which has &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sweet water?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanation for this lies in the cosmological model that Muhammad and earlier civilizations, such as those mentioned in the Bible or Sumerian and Akkadian civilizations, had in mind—a model that included the presence of a sweet water ocean above the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various verses in the Quran and Ahadith start aligning perfectly with this cosmological model when we understand the presence of a sweet water ocean in Muhammad's mind. For instance, Muhammad stated that Allah's throne was resting upon the water, a story he borrowed from the Bible. This connection can be seen in the verses from the Quran (11:7) and the corresponding passage from Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/11.7&quot;&gt;11:7&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ &lt;strong&gt;وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلْمَآءِ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and &lt;strong&gt;His Throne was upon the water&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad copied this story from Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of th&lt;span id=&quot;marker1990108&quot; class=&quot;offset-marker&quot; data-offset=&quot;1831452&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;e waters ... And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; under the firmament from the waters which &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background: #ffffff; color: #005ec3 !important; text-decoration: none; outline: none; font-family: 'Times New Roman', times, serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&quot; href=&quot;https://biblia.com/books/kjv1900/Ge1&quot; rel=&quot;popup&quot; data-resourcename=&quot;kjv1900&quot; data-content=&quot;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;resourcetext&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;lang-en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a data-reference=&amp;quot;Ps148.4&amp;quot; data-datatype=&amp;quot;bible+kjv&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;/reference/Ps148.4?resourceName=kjv1900&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;bibleref&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;vertical-align:normal&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Ps 148:4 &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;above the firmament ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters.&lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ... Then God said, “Let there be a space between the waters, to separate the waters of the heavens from the waters of the earth.” And that is what happened. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;God made this space to separate the waters of the earth from the waters of the heavens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Then God said, “Let the waters beneath the sky flow together into one place, so dry ground (i.e. the Earth) may appear.” And that is what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) continued this fantasy story in the following verse too, where he is claiming that He (i.e. Allah) sent down water from the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/23.18&quot;&gt;23:18&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءًۢ بِقَدَرٍ فَأَسْكَنَّٰهُ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ ۖ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ذَهَابٍۭ بِهِۦ لَقَٰدِرُونَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Pickthall) And we send &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;down from the sky water (i.e. rain) in measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and We give it lodging in the earth, and lo! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are also Able to withdraw this water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Maududi) We sent down water from the sky in right measure, and caused it to stay in the earth, and We have the power&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to cause this water to vanish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sahih International) And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth. And indeed, &lt;strong&gt;We are Able to take it away&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please reflect upon these words in this verse: &quot;... &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We can also &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;withdraw/vanish/take it away&lt;/span&gt; this water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot; &lt;/em&gt;when referring to the water sent down from the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem arises from the fact that during the Flood of Noah, a significant amount of rainwater from this same sweet water ocean above the heavens fell, and it has continued to do so with each rainfall thereafter. Theoretically, this constant rainfall from the heavenly ocean should have flooded the Earth. To avert this, the Quranic writer had to include the notion of withdrawing or vanishing this rainwater to save the Earth from a flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible also faces the same question regarding excessive water from the heavens. The rainwater falls directly from the heavenly ocean, leading to inquiries about what happens to the surplus water. The Bible suggests that it stays on Earth, as stated in Isaiah 55:10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm&quot;&gt;(Isaiah 55:10)&lt;/a&gt;: For as the&lt;strong&gt; rain and the snow come down (directly) from heaven and do not return there (i.e. back to heaven) but water the earth&lt;/strong&gt;, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Please also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/passage/?q=1+kings+8:35-36&quot;&gt;1 Kings 8:35&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/7-13.html&quot;&gt;2 Chronicles 7:13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the stories about rainwater during Noah's flood are also similar in both the Bible and the Quran, with references to the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;opening of gates or windows in the heavens&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://christiananswers.net/bible/gen7.html#11&quot;&gt;Bible, Genesis 7:11&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;windows of heaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; were opened (for rain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.11&quot;&gt;54:11&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;فَفَتَحْنَآ أَبْوَٰبَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَآءٍ مُّنْهَمِرٍ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then We opened the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the heaven with rain pouring down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that the understanding presented in the Quran and the Bible regarding the origin and behavior of rainwater is scientifically incorrect. In reality, rainwater does not come from the heavens but is a result of the water cycle, where water on Earth vaporizes, forms clouds, and then precipitates as rain. Water does not disappear or vanish but undergoes changes in form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId594445&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Barrier between the Salty Water of Earth's Ocean and the Sweet Water of Heavens' Ocean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/Islamic_cosmology_salt_sweet_ocean.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Barrier between the Salty Water of Earth's Ocean and the Sweet Water of Heavens' Ocean&quot; width=&quot;740&quot; height=&quot;795&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/Islamic_cosmology_salt_sweet_ocean.jpg&quot; class=&quot;float-none&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon revisiting the verse that mentions two oceans of salty and sweet water, we can now perceive how it aligns with the cosmological model incorporating a sweet water ocean above the heavens. This perspective allows the verse to find coherence and relevance within this framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/25.53&quot;&gt;25:53&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى مَرَجَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ هَٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخًا وَحِجْرًا مَّحْجُورًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is He who has released [simultaneously] the two seas, one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter, and He placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the commentary of this verse, the Sahaba (companions) also referred to the existence of the two oceans—one in heaven and one on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tafsir al-Qurtabi (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;amp;tSoraNo=25&amp;amp;tAyahNo=53&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;Commentary of Verse 25:53&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقال ابن عباس وابن جبير: يعني بحر السماء وبحر الأرض  قال ابن عباس: يلتقيان في كل عام وبينهما برزخ قضاء من قضائه. { وَحِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً } حراماً محرّماً أن يعذب هذا الملح بالعذب، أو يملح هذا العذب بالملح.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Abbas and Ibn Jubayr said: It refers to the ocean of the sky and the ocean of the earth. Ibn Abbas further explained: They meet each other every year, and between them is a barrier decreed by Allah. &quot;And a barrier between them is forbidden to be crossed.&quot; It is forbidden for the salty water to mix with the sweet water or for the sweet water to become salty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir recorded from Rab'i bin Anas, under the commentary of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=11&amp;amp;tAyahNo=7&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;11:7&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقال الربيع بن أنس : ( وكان عرشه على الماء ) فلما خلق السموات والأرض ، قسم ذلك الماء قسمين ، فجعل نصفا تحت العرش ، وهو البحر المسجور .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ar-Rabi' ibn Anas said: &quot;And His Throne was upon the water.&quot; So when He created the heavens and the earth, He divided that water into two parts, and He placed one half beneath the Throne, and that is the ocean that is known as &quot;Behr-al-Masjoor&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quranic verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=52&amp;amp;tAyahNo=6&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;52:6&lt;/a&gt; again mentions this &quot;Behr-e-Masjoor&quot; (i.e. water under the Throne of Allah), and Ibn Kathir recorded again from Rab'i bin Anas (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=52&amp;amp;tAyahNo=6&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قال الربيع بن أنس : هو الماء الذي تحت العرش ، الذي ينزل [ الله ] منه المطر الذي يحيي به الأجساد في قبورها يوم معادها . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rab'i bin Anas said: This is the water which is present under the Throne of Allah, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from which Allah sends down the (sweet) rainwater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And this same water will be used to make dead people become alive on the day of judgement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do remember that Islamic apologists make an excuse that the Quran is mentioning in this verse the meeting of two oceans of the earth. But their excuse is wrong, as there is not a single ocean in this world which has sweet water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Ibn Juraij (an exegete and &lt;a title=&quot;Hadith&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith&quot;&gt;hadith&lt;/a&gt; transmitter from the &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Taba' at-Tabi'in&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taba%27_at-Tabi%27in&quot;&gt;Taba' at-Tabi'in)&lt;/a&gt; became confused and said (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=25&amp;amp;tAyahNo=53&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; قال ابن جُرَيج: فلـم أجد بحراً عذبـاً إلا الأنهار العذاب&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not seen any ocean having sweet water. Only rivers have sweet water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists also attempt to present a new justification, suggesting that the verse refers to one ocean (of salty water) and one 'river' (of sweet water). However, this excuse lacks validity since the Quran explicitly uses the term &quot;al-bahrain, ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ&quot; meaning 'two oceans.' Therefore, it is not plausible to interpret this term as referring to one ocean and one river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;Furthermore, the inclusion of a sweet water ocean above the heavens in Muhammad's cosmological model provides evidence that &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Muhammad perceived the Earth to be flat.&lt;/span&gt; This concept cannot be reconciled with any spherical Earth model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId970176&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Cloud Model in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of the Quran, Muhammad, lacked knowledge about the water cycle. He shared the prevailing understanding of his time, which stated that rainwater originated from the sweet water ocean above the heavens. According to this belief, the &quot;Rain Model&quot; is as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rainwater was believed to originate from a sweet water ocean located above the heavens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rainwater was thought to descend from the seventh sky to the lowest first sky (of our world).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, according to this belief, the &quot;Cloud Model&quot; is as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The clouds are situated where the end corners of the 7 heavens meet each other. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then Allah sends winds that would carry the clouds to the lowest first sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the lowest sky, the clouds then absorb the rainwater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially, the clouds are present &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;as a unified entity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the place where the 7 skies meet each other.  They stay as this unified entity till they absorb water from the lowest first sky. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, only after that, Allah would break the clouds into fragments and scatter them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rain would fall in specific places as determined by Allah's will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are proofs of the Model of Clouds in Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/30.48&quot;&gt;30:48&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى يُرْسِلُ ٱلرِّيَٰحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَابًا فَيَبْسُطُهُۥ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ وَيَجْعَلُهُۥ كِسَفًا فَتَرَى ٱلْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلَٰلِهِۦ ۖ فَإِذَآ أَصَابَ بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِۦٓ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah (is) the One Who sends the winds, so they raise (the) clouds, then He spreads them in the sky, how He wills, and He makes them &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fragments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; so you see the rain coming forth from their midst. Then when He causes it to fall on whom He wills of His slaves, behold! They rejoice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddi said under the commentary of this verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=30&amp;amp;tAyahNo=48&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن السدي رضي الله عنه قال: يرسل الله الريح فتأتي بالسحاب من بين الخافقين - طرف السماء حين يلتقيان - فتخرجه ثم تنشره فيبسطه في السماء كيف يشاء،  فيسيل الماء على السحاب، ثم يمطر السحاب بعد ذلك.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated by As-Suddi, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: &quot;Allah sends the wind, and it brings the clouds from between the edges - the meeting point - of the sky (خافين). Then He brings them forth and spreads them in the sky as He wills. The water flows within the clouds, and then the clouds rain afterwards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Qatada said under the commentary of this verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=30&amp;amp;tAyahNo=48&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن قتادة رضي الله عنه في قوله { فيبسطه في السماء } قال: يجمعه ويجعله { كسفا } قال: قطعاً.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatada said about the verse { فيبسطه في السماء } that Allah first gathers these clouds at one place, and { كسفا } means he then scatters them in fragments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi%27un&quot;&gt;Tabi'un &lt;/a&gt;(i.e. 2nd generation of Muslims after Sahaba), we have recorded traditions that rain comes directly from the sweet water ocean, which is above the 7th heaven (upon which the throne of Allah is resting). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tafsir Durr-e-Manthur (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=2&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=26&amp;amp;tSoraNo=2&amp;amp;tAyahNo=22&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن الحسن. أنه سئل المطر من السماء أم من السحاب؟ قال: من السماء، إنما السحاب علم ينزل عليه الماء من السماء.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the authority of Al-Hasan, he was asked, &quot;Does the rain come from the sky or from the clouds?&quot; He replied, &quot;From the sky. The clouds are a sign that the water will descend upon them from the sky.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن كعب قال: السحاب غربال المطر، ولولا السحاب حين ينزل الماء من السماء لأفسد ما يقع عليه من الأرض، والبذر ينزل من السماء.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the authority of Ka'b, he said, &quot;Clouds are the sieves of rain. If it were not for the clouds when the water descends from the sky, it would ruin everything it falls upon on the Earth. And hails (of snow) are also sent down from the sky.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن خالد بن معدان قال: المطر ماء يخرج من تحت العرش، فينزل من سماء إلى سماء حيث يجمع في السماء الدنيا، فيجتمع في موضع يقال له الايرم، فتجيء السحاب السود، فتدخله فتشربه مثل شرب الاسفنجة، فيسوقها الله حيث يشاء.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the authority of Khalid ibn Ma'dan, he said, &quot;Rain is water that comes out from beneath the Throne, descending from one sky to another, where it gathers in the lower sky. It then converges in a place known as Al-A'ram. The dark clouds approach and enter it, consuming the water like a sponge. Then Allah drives them wherever He wills.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن عكرمة قال: ينزل الماء من السماء السابعة&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Ikrama said: Rainwater descends from the 7th heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since rainwater comes from the 7th heaven in Muhammad's mind (which is closer to the throne of Allah), thus Muhammad declared that rainwater is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;blessed&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; while it was present near Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:898&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 898&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anas (b. Malik) reported: It rained upon us as we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) removed his cloth (from a part of his body) till the rain fell on it. We said: Messenger of Allah, why did you do this? He said: It is because it (is blessed while it)&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;has just come &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;from the Exalted Lord (i.e. from heavens, where the throne of Allah is present)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the claim made by the writer of the Quran that clouds start as one entity and then become fragmented is scientifically incorrect. In reality, when water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it undergoes condensation, forming small, transparent cloud fragments. As more clouds gather in one area, they begin to appear as white-colored clouds. With further concentration of white clouds in the same region, they can develop into dark-colored clouds, from which rainfall eventually occurs. This process demonstrates that clouds start as fragmented entities and can gradually combine to form larger cloud formations before precipitation takes place. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/#:%7E:text=The%20Short%20Answer%3A,are%20floating%20in%20the%20air.&amp;amp;text=These%20energetic%20molecules%20then%20escape,in%20the%20form%20of%20gas.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it appears that Muhammad also borrowed the &quot;Cloud Model&quot; from the Bible. In Jeremiah 10:13, it is mentioned that God makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth, accompanied by thunder, rain, and wind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 10:13&lt;/a&gt;) When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he makes clouds rise (towards sky)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ends of the earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wind from his &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;storehouses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm&quot;&gt;Psalm 135:7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) He it is who makes the clouds rise &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 22, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at the end of the earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind from his &lt;strong&gt;storehouses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, a&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;ccording to the bible, clouds are stored at the ends of the earth, whereas according to the ٰIslam, they are stored between the corners of the skies where they meet each other. Thus, according to both of them, clouds are stored at almost the same places that are beyond the reach of people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/cloud_model_Islam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Model of Clouds: Islam vs The Bible&quot; width=&quot;702&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/cloud_model_Islam.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Moreover, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;According to the bible, God sends the wind from his '&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;storehouses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;' (&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-13.htm&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 10:13&lt;/a&gt;). And it is the same in the Quran too that Allah sends winds from the &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;storehouses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Quran: &lt;a href=&quot;https://islamawakened.com/quran/15/21/&quot;&gt;16:21-22&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلَّا عِندَنَا &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;خَزَآئِنُهُۥ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; وَمَا نُنَزِّلُهُۥٓ إِلَّا بِقَدَرٍ مَّعْلُومٍ &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;وَأَرْسَلْنَا ٱلرِّيَٰحَ لَوَٰقِحَ فَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَسْقَيْنَٰكُمُوهُ وَمَآ أَنتُمْ لَهُۥ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;بِخَٰزِنِينَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;And there is not a thing but that with Us are its &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;storehouses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and We do not send it down except according to a known measure. And We send the winds fertilising, and cause water to descend from the sky, and give it you to drink. It is not ye who are the holders of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; thereof.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm&quot;&gt;Bible, Psalm 135:7&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;treasuries (storehouses)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Sumerian culture also had the same basic model of cosmology and rain as the Bible and Islam have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tqmH3B80WW4/Tz6LYwjKWzI/AAAAAAAABPE/4WcL0VeUd9c/s1600/sumerian.jpg&quot; width=&quot;517&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; class=&quot;float-none&quot; alt=&quot;Cosmology in  Sumerian culture &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId877798&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Exposing the Deception: Misinterpretation of the Word &quot;Sky&quot; (ٱلسَّمَاء) by Islamic Apologists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to address the widespread false propaganda propagated by Islamic apologists, who have successfully indoctrinated both Muslims and non-Muslims into believing that the term &quot;sky&quot; (ٱلسَّمَاء) in the Quran can also mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clouds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the Quran mentions the descent of rainwater from the heavens in the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.22&quot;&gt;2:22&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٱلَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ فِرَٰشًا وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بِنَآءً&lt;strong&gt; وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who has made the earth your couch, and the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;heavens ٱلسَّمَآ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; your &lt;strong&gt;canopy&lt;/strong&gt;; and sent down &lt;strong&gt;rain&lt;/strong&gt; from the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;heavens ٱلسَّمَآ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern Islamic apologists deceitfully claim that the term 'sky' (ٱلسَّمَاءَ) in the Quran can also signify '&lt;strong&gt;atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;' or '&lt;strong&gt;from above&lt;/strong&gt;.' Consequently, they argue that the verse can be interpreted as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;.... and (He) sends down rainwater from the &lt;strong&gt;atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;from above &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; from clouds&lt;/strong&gt;).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the Quranic verse itself provides clarity, leaving no room for the escape of Islamic apologists. The verse utilizes the term 'sky' (ٱلسَّمَاءَ) &lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt;, explicitly conveying that it refers to the heavenly canopy erected by Allah, in contrast to the earthly bed or couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to recognize and refute these deceptions by Islamic apologists, that deviate from the clear meaning conveyed by the Quranic text itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, look at this verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.164&quot;&gt;2.164&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;verse__translation arabic-container&quot; data-translator-code=&quot;AR&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt class=&quot;arabic highlightable&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;إِنَّ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلَٰفِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلَّتِى تَجْرِى فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ ٱلنَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ ٱلرِّيَٰحِ &lt;strong&gt;وَٱلسَّحَابِ&lt;/strong&gt; ٱلْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ &lt;strong&gt;ٱلسَّمَآءِ&lt;/strong&gt; وَٱلْأَرْضِ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;verse__translation arabic-container&quot; data-translator-code=&quot;AR&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt class=&quot;arabic highlightable&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(If they want a sign for the perception of this Reality) surety there are countless signs for those who use their common sense; they can see alternation of the night and day, in the ships that sail the ocean laden with cargoes beneficial to mankind, &lt;strong&gt;and in the rain-water which Allah sends down from the sky&lt;/strong&gt; and thereby gives life to the earth after its death and spreads over it all kinds of animate creatures, in the blowing of the winds &lt;strong&gt;and in the clouds which obediently wait for orders between the sky and the earth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, this verse not only establishes the distinction between clouds and the sky (ٱلسَّمَاء), but it also explicitly clarifies the location of clouds between the earth and the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to acknowledge the gravity of these deceptions propagated by Islamic apologists. Their influence extends far and wide, significantly impacting the beliefs of millions of Muslims who wholeheartedly trust in these misleading interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId188094&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Concept of Thunder and Lightning in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thunder and lightning phenomenon was regarded as a mystery during the time of ignorance, and Muhammad capitalized on this lack of understanding by inventing stories to gain respect and instill fear as someone knowledgeable about the unseen world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, Muhammad fabricated the following narrative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an angel named R'ad who oversees the clouds. And the THUNDER that we hear, it is actually the voice of that angel R'ad which comes when he drives the clouds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, LIGHTNING occurs when the angel R'ad strikes the clouds with his iron whip. Subsequently, Allah employs the lightning as a means to punish those who defy Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/13.13&quot;&gt;13:13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَيُسَبِّحُ ٱلرَّعْدُ بِحَمْدِهِۦ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ مِنْ خِيفَتِهِۦ وَيُرْسِلُ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقَ فَيُصِيبُ بِهَا مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُمْ يُجَٰدِلُونَ فِى ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْمِحَالِ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the thunder declares His glory with His praise, and the angels too for awe of Him; and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He sends the thunderbolts and smites with them whom He pleases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, yet they dispute concerning Allah, and He is mighty in prowess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same in the Bible too that God thunders to kill his enemies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/18.html&quot;&gt;Psalm 18:13-14&lt;/a&gt; (NIV&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Lord thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy, with great bolts of lightning &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;he routed them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Muhammad introduced additional elements to this fictional narrative in the following tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal, Hadith 2479 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220818152519/https://web.archive.org/web/20220628135138/https://islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=6&amp;amp;ID=2353&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Abbas said: Once some Jews came to Muhammad and they said: &quot;We will ask you five questions, and if you can answer them correctly, then we will accept that you are the true prophet of God, and we will follow you&quot; ... They asked the fourth question: &quot;What is Thundering of clouds?&quot; Muhammad replied: &quot;There is an angel which Allah stipulated for supervising clouds. He has a whip of iron with which he hits the clouds (due to which lightning is produced), and drives them to go wherever Allah had ordered them to go ... and the thunder is the voice of that angel. Upon that the Jews testified Muhammad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; (authentic) Hadith (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220818152519/https://dorar.net/h/796214dc9b09ef0b46c7f522065e3413&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of ignorance, people had no means to verify or refute such fabricated stories. Consequently, they began to fear Muhammad as a prophet of God and became more compliant to his teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern scientific knowledge has debunked these unfounded tales. Scientific explanations have provided precise reasoning for natural phenomena such as thunder, lightning, earthquakes, and eclipses, contradicting Muhammad's fictional narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId655873&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Model of Hails in Muhammad's Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of ignorance, people commonly observed that snow was found in mountains. This led to the belief that there were &quot;mountains of snow&quot; in the heavens, from which hail accompanied rainwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with this prevailing understanding, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) also incorporated this concept from the time of ignorance into the Quranic verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220627090006/https://daaiyatulislam.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/tafsir-ibn-kathir-surah-24-an-nur.pdf&quot;&gt;24:43&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِنۢ بَرَدٍ فَيُصِيبُ بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَصْرِفُهُۥ عَن مَّن يَشَآءُ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And He sends down hail from the sky, from mountains within it, and it strikes whomever He wills and diverts it from whomever He wills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Qurtabi wrote under the commentary of this verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;amp;tSoraNo=24&amp;amp;tAyahNo=43&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{ وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِن بَرَدٍ } قيل: خلق الله في السماء جبالاً من بَرَد، فهو ينزِّل منها بَرَداً  وفيه إضمار، أي ينزِّل من جبال البرد بَرَدا، فالمفعول محذوف. ونحو هذا قول الفرّاء لأن التقدير عنده: من جبال برد فالجبال عنده هي البرد. و«بَرَدٍ» في موضع خفض ويجب أن يكون على قوله المعنى: من جبالٍ بردٍ فيها، بتنوين جبال. وقيل: إن الله تعالى خلق في السماء جبالاً فيها برد فيكون التقدير: وينزل من السماء من جبال فيها برد.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And He sends down from the sky hail from mountains within it, containing hailstones. It is said that Allah created mountains of hail in the sky, and He sends down hail from them ...  It is also said that Allah created mountains in the sky containing hail, so the intended meaning is: &quot;And He sends down from the sky from mountains within it containing hail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir writes under commentary of this verse 24:43 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220627090006/https://daaiyatulislam.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/tafsir-ibn-kathir-surah-24-an-nur.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;(and He sends down from (&lt;strong&gt;Min&lt;/strong&gt;) the sky, from (&lt;strong&gt;Min&lt;/strong&gt;) mountains in it of (&lt;strong&gt;Min&lt;/strong&gt;) ice,). Some of the grammarians said that the first Min describes the place from which it is coming, the second specifies from which part of the sky it comes, and the third means some kind of mountains. This is based on the view of those scholars of Tafsir who say that, مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِن بَرَدٍ from (Min) mountains in it of (Min) ice, means that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;there are mountains of hail in the sky from which Allah sends down ice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Muhammad copied this concept from the bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm&quot;&gt;(Isaiah 55:10)&lt;/a&gt;: For as the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;rain and&lt;strong&gt; the snow come down (directly) from heaven and do not return there but water the earth&lt;/strong&gt;, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm&quot;&gt;Job 38:22&lt;/a&gt;): Hast thou entered into the treasures (storehouses) of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail? [&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/job/38.htm&quot;&gt;Commentary&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;ital&quot;&gt;the treasures&quot; &lt;/span&gt; That is, the treasuries, the magazines. Snow and hail are represented as having been created and laid up in great storehouses in the heavens or above them]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId623638&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Source of sweet water of the Nile and Euphrates in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3207&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3207&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet (ﷺ) said: .... (On the night of ascension, where he went to heavens) Then I was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and four rivers originated at its root&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, 'The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nile and the Euphrates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:2839&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2839:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saihan, Jaihan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Euphrates and Nile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are all among the rivers of Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, these Ahadith have become a challenge and a headache for Islamic apologists as they do not align with any cosmological models. They are unable to provide an answer regarding how the water, which is flowing from the root of a tree in paradise, reaches the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, modern science has already identified the true sources of the sweet water in the Nile and the Euphrates rivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of Muhammad, people lacked knowledge about the true origins of the sweet water in the Nile and the Euphrates rivers. This provided Muhammad with an opportunity to fabricate falsehoods regarding their sources. However, modern science has exposed Muhammad's deceitful claims regarding these rivers' origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this issue is further resolved when we discover a similar story in the Bible, albeit with a slightly different concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:10-2:14&quot;&gt;Genesis 2:10-14&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-41&quot; class=&quot;text Gen-2-10&quot;&gt;A river watering the garden flowed from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; from there it was separated into &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; headwaters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-42&quot; class=&quot;text Gen-2-11&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;versenum&quot;&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;The name of the first is the Pishon&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;۔۔۔&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-44&quot; class=&quot;text Gen-2-13&quot;&gt;The name of the second river is the &lt;em&gt;Gihon&lt;/em&gt;; it winds through the entire land of Cush. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-45&quot; class=&quot;text Gen-2-14&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The name of the third river is the &lt;strong&gt;Tigris&lt;/strong&gt;; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the &lt;strong&gt;Euphrates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the biblical story and Muhammad's account is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Bible, the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Garden of Eden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; where Adam and Eve resided, along with the forbidden tree, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;was located on Earth&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore, it was logical for the Bible to state that the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers originated from the Garden of Eden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, Muhammad made an error in his rendition of the story. He claimed that Adam, Eve, and the forbidden tree were situated &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;not on Earth but in paradise in the heavens&lt;/span&gt;. This posed a challenge in explaining how the water from the root of a tree in heaven could reach the earthly rivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad, though he borrowed stories from the Bible, was not an educated scholar and remained largely illiterate. Consequently, he inadvertently made numerous human errors while retelling these ancient narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about the Garden of Eden/Paradise:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden&quot;&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garden of Eden, in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) book of Genesis, &lt;strong&gt;biblical&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;earthly paradise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; inhabited by the first created man and woman, Adam and Eve, prior to their expulsion for disobeying the commands of God...  The term paradise is often used as a synonym for the &lt;a class=&quot;md-crosslink autoxref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garden-of-Eden&quot; data-show-preview=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Garden of Eden&lt;/a&gt; before the expulsion of &lt;a class=&quot;md-crosslink autoxref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Adam-and-Eve-biblical-literary-figures&quot; data-show-preview=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Adam and Eve&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;span id=&quot;ref227530&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;md-crosslink&quot; style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/earthly-paradise-religion&quot;&gt;earthly paradise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;is often conceived of as existing in a time when &lt;a class=&quot;md-crosslink autoxref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/heaven&quot; data-show-preview=&quot;true&quot;&gt;heaven&lt;/a&gt; and earth were very close together or actually touching, and when humans and gods had free and happy association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId235256&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Concept of the 1st Heaven being 62 miles away from Earth in Muhammad's Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Quran, there are a total of seven heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Quran asserts that when devils attempt to eavesdrop on the heavenly assembly of angels in the 1st heaven of Earth, they are met with burning flames or meteors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern science has demonstrated that meteoroids only ignite once they enter Earth's atmosphere from space. The boundary of space is approximately 62 miles away from our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to the Quran, it suggests that the 1st Heaven is situated approximately 62 miles from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/72.8?context=2&quot;&gt;72:8-9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Jinns said] We sought to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;touch the heaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but we found it filled (with) guards severe, and burning flames. And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame (i.e. meteor) lying in wait for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: Are all scientists blind to not observe any tangible heaven (as described in the Quran and Hadith) just 62 miles away? Nor do they witness any angelic assembly, nor the presence of Adam and his descendants. Please refer to the following Hadith for further reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:163&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 163&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ... Gabriel ascended with me to the heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven (i.e. the heaven of the earth), Gabriel said to the guardian of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied. It is Gabriel. He again asked who is there with you. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes. Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. &lt;em&gt;When he looked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept.&lt;/em&gt; He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: &lt;em&gt;He is Adam (peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these scientists are not blind, it serves as evidence that the author of the Quran was simply fabricating falsehoods to deceive the people of that era. The writer assumed that no one would be able to venture into the sky to verify or refute his accounts of shooting stars, granting him the freedom to narrate fairytales in an attempt to captivate and gain followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH3&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId996932&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Contradiction in the Quran: Discrepancy in the Distance of the 1st Heaven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Quran, there exists a contradiction regarding the proximity of the 1st heaven to Earth. On one hand, the writer claims that shooting stars occur in the 1st heaven, indicating its proximity at 62 miles from Earth. However, the same writer also asserts that all the stars are present under the 1st heaven, adorning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/37.6?context=5&quot;&gt;37:6&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, We (Allah) have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses a contradiction, as modern science has demonstrated that stars are actually billions of light years away from our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite Muslims to reflect upon this contradiction presented in the Quran. Islamic apologists may attempt to provide explanations, but our detailed article, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=101&amp;amp;catid=15&quot;&gt;7 Scientific Blunders in the Single Quranic Story of 'Starsng Stars' &lt;/a&gt;&quot;, refutes such excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId369298&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The false Challenge of Allah that Humans (and Jinns) cannot cross the regions of Heavens and EARTH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Quran 55:33-35, Allah presents a challenge to both humans and jinns, asserting that they cannot cross the regions of the heavens and earth without His permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran 55:33-35:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O company of jinn and mankind,&lt;strong&gt; if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass&lt;/strong&gt;. You will not pass except by authority/permission [from Allah] ... There will be sent upon you a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;flame of fire and smoke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and you will not be able to defend yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to Allah's challenge, non-Muslims, atheists, and Hindus, who deny Allah's existence, have already crossed the regions of the Earth without seeking His permission. They have done so without facing any flame of fire or smoke hindering their journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;he writer of the Quran had the same story in his mind, which is also present in other verses of the Quran i.e. when devils try to sit in the 1st heaven, then stars transform into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;flames of fire and chase the devils&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;. Thus, in this verse 55:35 too, he is repeating the same threat i.e. if jinns or humans try to pass beyond the regions of heavens and the earth, then Allah will send a flame of fire and smoke upon them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the writer of the Quran was unaware that this flame of fire is limited to Earth's atmosphere. As a result, in space, there is neither flame nor smoke present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId985168&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The concept of the western and the eastern ends of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat Earth being &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;extremely &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/18.86&quot;&gt;18:86&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِى عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he (i.e. Dhulqarnain) reached the far west, he found the sun setting, he found it setting in a spring of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOT WATER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;/dark mud,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir tells us the reason for the hot water there i.e. it is hot while &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the western edge of FLAT Earth is &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d;&quot;&gt;CLOSER&lt;/span&gt; to the spot where the SUN sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir wrote under the commentary of verse 18:86 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;amp;tAyahNo=86&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=1&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; وقال ابن جرير والصواب أنهما قراءتان مشهورتان، وأيهما قرأ القارىء فهو مصيب، قلت ولا منافاة بين معنييهما إذ قد تكون حارة لمجاورتها وهج الشمس عند غروبها، وملاقاتها الشعاع بلا حائل&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Jarir said, “There are two well-known recitations (i.e.  the sun disappears in black mud, or the sun disappears in the spring of hot water) and whichever one the reciter recites is correct.” And I (i.e. Ibn Kathir) say, there is no contradiction between their two meanings, as it may be the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;water is hot because it is near the glare of the sun at sunset (i.e. the western edge of the flat earth is closer to sun)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and it meets the rays without a barrier. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Quran also tells the story that the far eastern edge of the flat earth is also hot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/18.90&quot;&gt;18:90&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَطْلِعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَطْلُعُ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ لَّمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُم مِّن دُونِهَا سِتْرًا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until, when he (i.e. Dhulqarnain) came to the rising place of the sun (i.e. the far eastern edge of Flat Earth), he found it rising on a people for whom &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We (Allah) had provided no shelter against the sun (i.e. no trees etc. while all of them burnt due to the extreme heat)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir wrote under the commentary of this verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;amp;tSoraNo=18&amp;amp;tAyahNo=90&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=6&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;original-text&quot;&gt; وقال قتادة ذكر لنا أنهم بأرض لا تنبت لهم شيئاً، فهم إذا طلعت الشمس، دخلوا في أسراب، حتى إذا زالت الشمس، خرجوا إلى حروثهم ومعايشهم ...  فقال لهم أهلها لا تطلعن عليكم الشمس وأنتم بها، قالوا لا نبرح حتى تطلع الشمس، ما هذه العظام؟ قالوا هذه جيف جيش طلعت عليهم الشمس ههنا فماتوا، قال فذهبوا هاربين في الأرض.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;original-text&quot;&gt;Qatadah said, &quot;It was mentioned to us that they were in a land &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;where nothing grew (due to heat while it is closer to the place of sun rise)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; so when the sun rose they would go into tunnels&lt;/em&gt; until it had passed its zenith, then they would come out to go about their daily lives and earn themselves a living ... &lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;And once an army came to them, and they (the locals) said to them: “You should not be here when the sun rises.” But they (didn't listen to the locals and) said, “We will not leave until the sun rises. But what type of bones are these that are lying here?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;They (the locals) said, &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the carcasses of an army (which came here before you). The sun rose on them here, and they died.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; Upon hearing that, the army went back from there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;original-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This also proves that Earth was flat in Muhammad's mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId176196&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hadith of &lt;em&gt;Sun Rising between the Devil's Horns&lt;/em&gt; also proves that the &lt;em&gt;Earth was Flat&lt;/em&gt; in Muhammad's mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment --&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:828b&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 828b&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Do not intend to observe prayer at the time of the rising of the sun nor at its setting, for it rises between the horns of Satan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;According to Muhammad, during sunrise and sunset, he believed that the sun is directly above Satan's head, positioned between his horns. Muhammad further associated non-Muslims' prostration during these times with prostrating to Satan. This assertion can be found in &lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/6/358&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 832&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad's understanding of the world was rooted in the belief that it was flat, lacking knowledge about the continuous rising and setting of the sun. From his perspective, it seemed plausible that the sun would travel around Satan once, with everyone observing the same phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Muhammad's interpretation reflects his limited understanding at that time, as he was unaware of the scientific reality of the Earth's rotation and the sun's consistent movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId284755&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lack of Understanding in the Qur'an Regarding Eclipses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Qur'an does not display any comprehension of eclipses. This may be attributed to the limited exposure Muhammad had to such phenomena, as the hadith accounts suggest he only witnessed a single solar eclipse, which deeply unsettled him and led to an extraordinary display of devotion. Surprisingly, the Qur'an mentions eclipses only once, referring to a lunar eclipse that is predicted to occur at the end of the world. Interestingly, the Qur'an contains a statement that could be perceived as contradictory to the occurrence of eclipses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/36.40?Context=3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 36:40&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon, nor can the Night outstrip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a solar eclipse to occur, however, the sun and the moon actually must (from the perspective of the earth) &quot;catch up&quot; to each other in their &quot;orbits.&quot; But since the moon itself is not visible at that time, the authors of the Qur'an never noticed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, when discussing the end of time, the Qur'an assumes that a lunar eclipse (which can only occur when the sun and moon are on opposite sides of the earth) can occur at the same time that the sun and moon finally do “catch up” to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qur'an &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/75.6-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;75:6-9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;He asketh: “When will be this Day of Resurrection?” But when sight is confounded. And the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moon is eclipsed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sun and moon are united&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “uniting” of the sun and the moon not only demonstrates a singular instance when they do “catch up” with each other but suggests that its author assumed the common perception that the sun and moon are of comparable size and distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible and Islamic traditions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=69&amp;amp;catid=12&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) both assert that Adam lived around 6,000 years ago. However, with the emergence of scientific discoveries, this claim has faced challenges, leading Islamic apologists to reassess their stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for their reconsideration lies in the discoveries made by scientists. Fossil evidence of modern humans has been found, dating back approximately 300,000 years. For instance, an image of a human skull, known as SKHUL, has been dated to be around 100,000 years old (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_human&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Skhul.JPG/300px-Skhul.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;0.1 million years old human skull (known as SKHUL)&quot; width=&quot;144&quot; height=&quot;150&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, ancient cave paintings, such as the one depicting a hyena found in the Chauvet Cave in France, have been discovered and are estimated to be approximately 30,000 years old (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_hyena&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/20%2C000_Year_Old_Cave_Paintings_Hyena.png/330px-20%2C000_Year_Old_Cave_Paintings_Hyena.png&quot; alt=&quot;30,000-year-old cave hyena painting found in the Chauvet Cave, France&quot; width=&quot;330&quot; height=&quot;226&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scientific findings make it untenable for Islamic apologists to maintain the belief that Adam lived only 6,000 years ago. Consequently, they have adapted their position to assert that Adam likely lived at least 300,000 years ago, in alignment with the evidence presented by the fossils of modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId224482&quot;&gt;Both the Bible and the Quran lack any knowledge of our ancestors' hunter-gatherer lifestyle that endured for approximately 290,000 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId205296&quot;&gt;Agriculture also started only 10 thousand years ago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId234201&quot;&gt;The Bible, Quran, and other religious texts make no mention of the 'Ice Age.'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId982187&quot;&gt;Islamic claim: Humans have been decreasing in stature (height) since Adam's creation, who was 60 cubits tall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists, in response to evidence from modern human fossils, attempted to push back Adam's arrival to around 300 thousand years ago. However, the &quot;Stone Age&quot; undermines their argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stone Age is a significant period in human history, spanning from approximately 2.5 million years ago until just 10 thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ancient.eu/Stone_Age/&quot; rel=&quot;alternate&quot;&gt;www.ancient.eu/Stone_Age/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Stone Age is also divided into three different periods. Paleolithic or Old Stone Age: from the first production of stone artefacts, about &lt;b&gt;2.5 million years ago&lt;/b&gt;, to the end of the last Ice Age, about &lt;strong&gt;9,600 BCE&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the longest Stone Age period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to modern science, various hominids, including modern humans, Neanderthals, and Homo erectus, lived during the Stone Age. They relied solely on tools made of stones or bones for hunting and other activities until just 10 thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to accept the premise that Adam arrived 300 thousand years ago, as suggested by modern human fossils, it raises questions that Islamic apologists must address. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why didn't Adam teach his descendants to use more advanced tools than simple stone tools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did his progeny continue to remain in the Stone Age for the next 290 thousand years, only emerging from it relatively recently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line of reasoning highlights the apparent inconsistency in the apologist's argument, particularly when considering the overwhelming evidence supporting the theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This theory of Islamic apologists (i.e. Adam came 300,000 years ago) becomes so ridiculous only while they have to deny the Theory of Evolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId224482&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Both the Bible and the Quran lack any knowledge of our ancestors' hunter-gatherer lifestyle that endured for approximately 290,000 years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Like the Stone Age, our ancestors also stayed as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer&quot;&gt;Hunter-gatherers&lt;/a&gt; for at least 290 thousand years, and they started to make settlements only 10 thousand years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hunter-gatherer is a human living a lifestyle in which most or all food is obtained by foraging (gathering edible wild plants) and hunting (pursuing and killing wild animals), in the same way, that most natural &lt;a title=&quot;Omnivore&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore&quot;&gt;omnivores&lt;/a&gt; do. In contrast to agricultural societies, which rely mainly on cultivating crops and raising domesticated animals for food production&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But there is no mention of Hunter-gatherers in the Bible or in the Quran or any other religious book, while all these religions are much younger than 10 thousand years and their founders didn't know about the history of their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The evolution and domestication of the following 3 animals played a vital role at the beginning of Herding Culture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human settlements began to emerge as agriculture and herding practices took shape around 10,000 years ago. Prior to this, modern humans persisted as hunter-gatherers for an extensive span of at least 290,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As compared to domestic sheep and cows, we have fossils of millions of other animals which go back millions of years ago. And we also have cave paintings of a lot of animals, which go up to 50,000 years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). For example, look at this cave painting from the &lt;b&gt;Cave of Altamira, Spain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Altamira_bisons.jpg/495px-Altamira_bisons.jpg&quot; width=&quot;495&quot; height=&quot;330&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But as far as domestic sheep and cows are concerned, then neither there exists any fossil of them nor any cave painting of them which is older than 11,000 years. The same is true about the dogs and neither any fossil of a dog is present, nor any cave painting present which is older than 14000 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic stories portray Adam and his descendants as cultivators of crops and herders of domesticated animals, which sets them apart from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. A specific verse (5:27) in the Quran and the commentaries of all Muslim Mufassirin present various traditions describing how Qabeel (son of Adam) offered a part of his crops as a 'sacrifice' to Allah, while his brother Habeel presented a sheep for the same purpose. These accounts reinforce the belief that Adam's lineage engaged in agricultural and herding practices rather than hunting and gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;For example, Ibn Kathir recorded this tradition and declared it to have a better than a good chain of narration (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;وقال ابن أبي حاتم حدثنا الحسن بن محمد بن الصباح حدثنا حجاج عن ابن جريج، أخبرني ابن خثيم قال أقبلت مع سعيد بن جبير، فحدثني عن ابن عباس، قال نهى أن تنكح المرأة أخاها توأمها، وأمر أن ينكحها غيره من إخوتها، وكان يولد له في كل بطن رجل وامرأة، فبينما هم كذلك، إذ ولد له امرأة وضيئة، وولد له أخرى قبيحة دميمة، فقال أخو الدميمة أنكحني أختك، وأنكحك أختي، فقال لا، أنا أحق بأختي، فقربا قرباناً، فتقبل من صاحب &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;الكبش&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;، ولم يتقبل من صاحب&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;الزرع&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;، فقتله. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;إسناد جيد&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;justify1&quot;&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said -- that during the time of Adam -- &quot;The woman was not allowed in marriage for her male twin, but Adam was commanded to marry her to any of her other brothers. In each pregnancy, Adam was given a twin, a male and a female. A beautiful daughter was once born for Adam and another one that was not beautiful. So the twin brother of the ugly daughter said, `Marry your sister to me and I will marry my sister to you.' He said, `No, for I have more right to my sister.' So they both offered a sacrifice. The sacrifice of the one who offered &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the sheep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was accepted while the sacrifice of the other (the twin brother of the beautiful daughter), which consisted of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some crops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was not accepted. So the latter killed his brother.'' &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story has a better than good chain of narration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حدثنـي موسى بن هارون، قال: ثنا عمرو بن حماد، قال: ثنا أسبـاط، عن السديّ، فـيـما ذكر عن أبـي مالك، وعن أبـي صالـح، عن ابن عبـاس. وعن مرّة، عن ابن مسعود، وعن ناس من أصحاب النبـيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم: كان لا يولد لآدم مولود إلا ولد معه جارية، فكان يزوّج غلام هذا البطن جارية هذا البطن الآخر، ويزوّج جارية هذا البطن غلام البطن هذا الآخر. حتـى ولد له ابنان يقال لهما: قابـيـل، وهابـيـل، وكان قابـيـل صاحب زرع، وكان هابـيـل صاحب ضرع. وكان قابـيـل أكبرهما، وكان له أخت أحسن من أخت هابـيـل. وإن هابـيـل طلب أن ينكح أخت قابـيـل، فأبى علـيه وقال: هي أختي ولدت معي، وهي أحسن من أختك، وأنا أحقّ أن أتزوّجها. فأمره أبوه أن يزوّجها هابـيـل فأبى. وإنهما قرّبـا قربـاناً إلـى الله أيهما أحقّ بـالـجارية، وكان آدم يومئذ قد غاب عنهما إلـى مكة ينظر إلـيها، قال الله لآدم: يا آدم، هل تعلـم أن لـي بـيتاً فـي الأرض؟ قال: اللهمّ لا قال: فإن لـي بـيتاً بـمكة فأته فقال آدم للسماء: احفظي ولدي بـالأمانة، فأبت. وقال للأرض فأبت، وقال للـجبـال فأبت، وقال لقابـيـل، فقال: نعم تذهب وترجع وتـجد أهلك كما يسرّك. فلـما انطلق آدم قرّبـا قربـاناً، وكان قابـيـل يفخر علـيه، فقال: أنا أحقّ بها منك، هي أختـي، وأنا أكبر منك، وأنا وصيّ والديّ. فلـما قرّبـا، قرّب هابـيـل جذعة سمينة، وقرّب قابـيـل حُزمة سنبل، فوجد فـيها سنبلة عظيـمة ففركها فأكلها. فنزلت النار فأكلت قربـان هابـيـل، وتركت قربـان قابـيـل، فغضب وقال: لأقتلنك حتـى لا تنكح أختـي فقال هابـيـل { إنَّـمَا يَتَقَبَّلُ اللَّهُ مِنَ الـمُتَّقِـينَ }.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was narrated from as-Suddi, in his narration from Abu Maalik and from Abu Saalih from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Murrah from Ibn Mas‘ood, and from some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): No son was born to Adam but a daughter would be born with him, and the boy from this pregnancy would marry the girl from another pregnancy, and the girl from this pregnancy would marry a boy from another pregnancy. This continued till two boys Qabeel and Habeel were born. Qabeel was a grower of crops, and Habeel kept the livestock of animals. Qabeel was the elder one, and the sister that was born along with him was more beautiful than the girl who was born along with Habeel. When Habeel wished to marry the sister of Qabeel, then Qabeel refused to accept it and said: &quot;She is my sister as she was born along with me, and she is more beautiful than your sister, and thus I have more right to marry her. But his father (i.e. Adam) ordered him to let Habeel marry her, but Qabeel still refused. And both of them offered a sacrifice to see who had more right upon that girl ... &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habeel offered a fat lamb as offering, while Qabeel offered a sheaf of corn, but took out a big corn from it and ate it. Fire came down (from heaven) and consumed the offering of Habeel, but not that of Qaabeel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; [i.e., Haabeel’s offering was accepted and Qaabeel’s was not]. Upon that Qabeel became angry and he said: &quot;I will certainly kill you, and you will not be able to marry my sister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220428104808/https://dorar.net/h/808e9bbf2bff4252bd3830e50578ec2d&quot;&gt;Sahih (Albani)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId205296&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Agriculture also started only 10 thousand years ago&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of agriculture, including the cultivation of crops, began only around 10 thousand years ago during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic&quot;&gt;Neolithic Period&lt;/a&gt;, which followed the end of the ice age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this historical evidence, both the Bible and the Quran assert that Adam initiated agriculture upon his arrival on Earth. In verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/5.27&quot;&gt;5:27&lt;/a&gt; of the Quran, along with its commentary by Ibn Jarir Tabari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), multiple traditions are recorded describing how Qabeel (son of Adam) offered a part of his crop as a 'sacrifice' to Allah, while his brother Habeel presented a sheep for the same purpose. Similarly, other traditions mentioned by Ibn Kathir discuss the sacrifice of sheep and crops by the sons of Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the cultivation of crops and the presence of domestic sheep also prove that the story of Adam cannot be older than 10 thousand years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId234201&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Bible, Quran, and other religious texts make no mention of the 'Ice Age.'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ice Age (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), which concluded approximately 10 thousand years ago, finds no reference in these ancient scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of such knowledge can be attributed to the fact that these religious texts were authored much more recently than 10 thousand years ago. Consequently, their human creators lacked awareness of events that transpired thousands of years before their time, including the Stone Age and the Ice Age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, humans began utilizing iron a mere 3500 years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), marking the inception of the Iron Age. Before that, approximately 5500 years ago, they had discovered bronze, leading to what is known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age&quot;&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preceding the Bronze Age was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic&quot;&gt;Copper Age&lt;/a&gt;, bridging the gap between the Stone Age and the Bronze Age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Homo species began crafting tools from stone around 2.5 million years ago, a practice that persisted until about 10 thousand years ago. Subsequently, the Stone Age transitioned into the Copper Age, during which humans adopted the use of copper for toolmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId159179&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The challenge of Noah's Ark for Muslims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the bible, the gap between Adam and Noah was 1056 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this gap is the same according to Islam too. Saudi Salafi Mufti at Islam Question Answer wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20141226115909/http://islamqa.info/en/20907&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period between Adam and Nooh (peace be upon them both): it was narrated from Abu Umaamah that a man said: “O Messenger of Allaah, was Adam a Prophet?” He said, “Yes, and Allaah spoke to him.” The man asked, “How much (time) was there between him and Nooh?” He said, “Ten centuries.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his &lt;i&gt;Saheeh&lt;/i&gt;, 14/69; and by al-Haakim, 2/262. He said it is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Ibn Katheer said in &lt;i&gt;al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah&lt;/i&gt; (1/94): this is (saheeh) according to the conditions of Muslim, even though he did not narrate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the fossils of modern humans and other homos compel Muslims to claim that Adam came at least 300,000 years ago, but on the other hand, they are unable to tell how Noah could have constructed such a massive vessel using only stone and bone tools..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Quran, Noah's Ark is described as being made of &quot;&lt;strong&gt;planks&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;nails&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; (Quran 54:13), implying that it was not a primitive construction from the Stone Age. Instead, it suggests the use of more advanced materials like wood, indicating a level of technology beyond that of the Stone Age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.13&quot;&gt;54:13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;And We carried him on (ark) made of planks and nails,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Muhammad came only 1400 years ago, and till his time, iron nails were available and used for naval shipbuilding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dilemma arises from the immense size of the ark, which was tasked with carrying pairs of animals from across the entire world, along with their food and water. Such an undertaking would require modern technology and tools, and even with today's technology, the largest wooden ship is only about 100 meters long. Furthermore, modern ships of this size rely on iron nails and steel wires to hold the planks together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the modern technology of today, the biggest ship, which is made out of wood, is only 100 meters long (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151013170709/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), even though not only a lot of iron nails have been used in it, but they also had to use steel wires in order to keep the planks together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question remains: how could Noah have built such a colossal ark 300,000 years ago without access to the technology we have today, including iron wires or ropes? This paradox raises intriguing challenges for Muslims seeking to reconcile the traditional timeline with the account of Noah's Ark as described in their religious texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId175121&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The oldest naval Ship is only 5 thousand years old&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the issues faced by Muslims is related to the age of the oldest naval ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to scientific discoveries (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship#History&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), the oldest known naval ship is approximately 5 thousand years old, and it was built by the ancient Egyptians. These early Egyptian ships were quite rudimentary, constructed with planks for the hulls and tied together with ropes since the technology for making nails was not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have come across numerous paintings depicting these early naval ships, which are around 5 thousand years old. However, there is a significant absence of any paintings representing more advanced ships older than 5 thousand years. Additionally, there are no 'cave paintings' featuring any type of naval ship, despite the existence of cave paintings dating back as far as 50,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, this raises questions for Muslims seeking to reconcile the age of the oldest naval ship with their historical and religious beliefs. The evidence points to the fact that advanced shipbuilding techniques and representations of such ships did not exist before the time of the early Egyptian vessels, further challenging traditional narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an image of an Egyptian boat from about 4 thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Egyptian boats&quot; src=&quot;https://heartheboatsing.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/pic-42.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Egyptian boat building about 4000 years ago&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;415&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Egyptian boats were the most advanced boats in the world from 4000 to 5000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId982187&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamic claim: Humans have been decreasing in stature (height) since Adam's creation, who was 60 cubits tall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad claimed that Adam was 60 cubits tall, and the height of humans has been progressively decreasing since Adam's creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3326&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3326&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;Allah created Adam, making him 60 cubits tall ... Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad made such stories while he thought that no one was able to certify or deny such fairy tales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern science has provided evidence that contradicts these claims and has the capacity to verify or dismiss such assertions. Scientists have discovered human fossils dating back 300 thousand years, and all of them exhibit the typical height of present-day humans. Additionally, fossils of the Homo family, which go back as far as 3.4 million years, also demonstrate the same height as modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scientific findings challenge the notion that humans have been diminishing in stature since Adam's creation. As a result, it is essential to critically examine ancient beliefs in light of contemporary knowledge and evidence to achieve a deeper understanding of our history and origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The emergence of Neanderthals and Homo erectus has led Islamic preachers to assert a new, implausible claim that Adam existed 1.8 million years ago&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/human_evolution.png&quot; alt=&quot;Human Evolution&quot; width=&quot;714&quot; height=&quot;203&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/human_evolution.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the earliest fossils of modern humans date back approximately 300,000 years, the earliest known Neanderthal-like fossils are around 0.5 million years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1 to 4 percent of the DNA in Europeans and Asians is identified as non-modern, sharing similarities with ancient Neanderthal DNA rather than that of Sub-Saharan Africans. Recent research even suggests a higher prevalence of Neanderthal genes in non-African humans than previously thought, with approximately 20% of the Neanderthal gene pool found in a broad sample of non-African individuals. Despite this, each individual's genome averages only 2% Neanderthal (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of Neanderthals prompted creationists, including Islamic preachers, to argue that Neanderthals were not a distinct species but rather humans. Consequently, they claim that Adam existed 0.5 million years ago. According to this perspective, humans supposedly endured the Stone Age for half a million years, utilizing only tools crafted from stones and bones, and emerged from this era only 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the narrative did not conclude with Neanderthals. Human-like fossils of Homo erectus, dating back 1.8 million years, compelled creationists to assert that Adam existed 1.8 million years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icr.org/article/homo-erectus-the-ape-man-that-wasnt&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;). This claim becomes even more absurd, as it implies, according to creationists, that humans persisted in the Stone Age for 1.8 million years, relying solely on tools fashioned from stones and bones, and transitioned out of this era only 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId502859&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, modern science has presented significant challenges for Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Muslims adhere to their traditions and early scholars, accepting that Adam arrived 6000 years ago, the discovery of 300 thousand years old fossils of modern humans directly contradicts their beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, if Muslims contend that Adam existed 300 thousand years ago, inconsistencies arise when examining the story of Adam's son and the development of cultivation and herding practices. Furthermore, it raises questions about why Adam's descendants remained in the Stone Age for the subsequent 290 thousand years and how Noah managed to construct such an enormous ark during that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conflicting narratives create dilemmas for Muslims, which they are unable to solve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible and Islamic traditions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=69&amp;amp;catid=12&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) both assert that Adam lived around 6,000 years ago. However, with the emergence of scientific discoveries, this claim has faced challenges, leading Islamic apologists to reassess their stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for their reconsideration lies in the discoveries made by scientists. Fossil evidence of modern humans has been found, dating back approximately 300,000 years. For instance, an image of a human skull, known as SKHUL, has been dated to be around 100,000 years old (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_human&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Skhul.JPG/300px-Skhul.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;0.1 million years old human skull (known as SKHUL)&quot; width=&quot;144&quot; height=&quot;150&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, ancient cave paintings, such as the one depicting a hyena found in the Chauvet Cave in France, have been discovered and are estimated to be approximately 30,000 years old (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_hyena&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/20%2C000_Year_Old_Cave_Paintings_Hyena.png/330px-20%2C000_Year_Old_Cave_Paintings_Hyena.png&quot; alt=&quot;30,000-year-old cave hyena painting found in the Chauvet Cave, France&quot; width=&quot;330&quot; height=&quot;226&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scientific findings make it untenable for Islamic apologists to maintain the belief that Adam lived only 6,000 years ago. Consequently, they have adapted their position to assert that Adam likely lived at least 300,000 years ago, in alignment with the evidence presented by the fossils of modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists, in response to evidence from modern human fossils, attempted to push back Adam's arrival to around 300 thousand years ago. However, the &quot;Stone Age&quot; undermines their argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stone Age is a significant period in human history, spanning from approximately 2.5 million years ago until just 10 thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ancient.eu/Stone_Age/&quot; rel=&quot;alternate&quot;&gt;www.ancient.eu/Stone_Age/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Stone Age is also divided into three different periods. Paleolithic or Old Stone Age: from the first production of stone artefacts, about &lt;b&gt;2.5 million years ago&lt;/b&gt;, to the end of the last Ice Age, about &lt;strong&gt;9,600 BCE&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the longest Stone Age period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to modern science, various hominids, including modern humans, Neanderthals, and Homo erectus, lived during the Stone Age. They relied solely on tools made of stones or bones for hunting and other activities until just 10 thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to accept the premise that Adam arrived 300 thousand years ago, as suggested by modern human fossils, it raises questions that Islamic apologists must address. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why didn't Adam teach his descendants to use more advanced tools than simple stone tools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did his progeny continue to remain in the Stone Age for the next 290 thousand years, only emerging from it relatively recently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line of reasoning highlights the apparent inconsistency in the apologist's argument, particularly when considering the overwhelming evidence supporting the theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This theory of Islamic apologists (i.e. Adam came 300,000 years ago) becomes so ridiculous only while they have to deny the Theory of Evolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId224482&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Both the Bible and the Quran lack any knowledge of our ancestors' hunter-gatherer lifestyle that endured for approximately 290,000 years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Like the Stone Age, our ancestors also stayed as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer&quot;&gt;Hunter-gatherers&lt;/a&gt; for at least 290 thousand years, and they started to make settlements only 10 thousand years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hunter-gatherer is a human living a lifestyle in which most or all food is obtained by foraging (gathering edible wild plants) and hunting (pursuing and killing wild animals), in the same way, that most natural &lt;a title=&quot;Omnivore&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore&quot;&gt;omnivores&lt;/a&gt; do. In contrast to agricultural societies, which rely mainly on cultivating crops and raising domesticated animals for food production&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But there is no mention of Hunter-gatherers in the Bible or in the Quran or any other religious book, while all these religions are much younger than 10 thousand years and their founders didn't know about the history of their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The evolution and domestication of the following 3 animals played a vital role at the beginning of Herding Culture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human settlements began to emerge as agriculture and herding practices took shape around 10,000 years ago. Prior to this, modern humans persisted as hunter-gatherers for an extensive span of at least 290,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As compared to domestic sheep and cows, we have fossils of millions of other animals which go back millions of years ago. And we also have cave paintings of a lot of animals, which go up to 50,000 years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). For example, look at this cave painting from the &lt;b&gt;Cave of Altamira, Spain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Altamira_bisons.jpg/495px-Altamira_bisons.jpg&quot; width=&quot;495&quot; height=&quot;330&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;But as far as domestic sheep and cows are concerned, then neither there exists any fossil of them nor any cave painting of them which is older than 11,000 years. The same is true about the dogs and neither any fossil of a dog is present, nor any cave painting present which is older than 14000 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic stories portray Adam and his descendants as cultivators of crops and herders of domesticated animals, which sets them apart from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. A specific verse (5:27) in the Quran and the commentaries of all Muslim Mufassirin present various traditions describing how Qabeel (son of Adam) offered a part of his crops as a 'sacrifice' to Allah, while his brother Habeel presented a sheep for the same purpose. These accounts reinforce the belief that Adam's lineage engaged in agricultural and herding practices rather than hunting and gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;For example, Ibn Kathir recorded this tradition and declared it to have a better than a good chain of narration (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=2&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;وقال ابن أبي حاتم حدثنا الحسن بن محمد بن الصباح حدثنا حجاج عن ابن جريج، أخبرني ابن خثيم قال أقبلت مع سعيد بن جبير، فحدثني عن ابن عباس، قال نهى أن تنكح المرأة أخاها توأمها، وأمر أن ينكحها غيره من إخوتها، وكان يولد له في كل بطن رجل وامرأة، فبينما هم كذلك، إذ ولد له امرأة وضيئة، وولد له أخرى قبيحة دميمة، فقال أخو الدميمة أنكحني أختك، وأنكحك أختي، فقال لا، أنا أحق بأختي، فقربا قرباناً، فتقبل من صاحب &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;الكبش&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;، ولم يتقبل من صاحب&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;الزرع&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;، فقتله. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;إسناد جيد&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;justify1&quot;&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said -- that during the time of Adam -- &quot;The woman was not allowed in marriage for her male twin, but Adam was commanded to marry her to any of her other brothers. In each pregnancy, Adam was given a twin, a male and a female. A beautiful daughter was once born for Adam and another one that was not beautiful. So the twin brother of the ugly daughter said, `Marry your sister to me and I will marry my sister to you.' He said, `No, for I have more right to my sister.' So they both offered a sacrifice. The sacrifice of the one who offered &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the sheep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was accepted while the sacrifice of the other (the twin brother of the beautiful daughter), which consisted of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some crops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was not accepted. So the latter killed his brother.'' &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story has a better than good chain of narration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tafsir Tabari, under verse 5:27 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;Page=3&amp;amp;Size=1&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حدثنـي موسى بن هارون، قال: ثنا عمرو بن حماد، قال: ثنا أسبـاط، عن السديّ، فـيـما ذكر عن أبـي مالك، وعن أبـي صالـح، عن ابن عبـاس. وعن مرّة، عن ابن مسعود، وعن ناس من أصحاب النبـيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم: كان لا يولد لآدم مولود إلا ولد معه جارية، فكان يزوّج غلام هذا البطن جارية هذا البطن الآخر، ويزوّج جارية هذا البطن غلام البطن هذا الآخر. حتـى ولد له ابنان يقال لهما: قابـيـل، وهابـيـل، وكان قابـيـل صاحب زرع، وكان هابـيـل صاحب ضرع. وكان قابـيـل أكبرهما، وكان له أخت أحسن من أخت هابـيـل. وإن هابـيـل طلب أن ينكح أخت قابـيـل، فأبى علـيه وقال: هي أختي ولدت معي، وهي أحسن من أختك، وأنا أحقّ أن أتزوّجها. فأمره أبوه أن يزوّجها هابـيـل فأبى. وإنهما قرّبـا قربـاناً إلـى الله أيهما أحقّ بـالـجارية، وكان آدم يومئذ قد غاب عنهما إلـى مكة ينظر إلـيها، قال الله لآدم: يا آدم، هل تعلـم أن لـي بـيتاً فـي الأرض؟ قال: اللهمّ لا قال: فإن لـي بـيتاً بـمكة فأته فقال آدم للسماء: احفظي ولدي بـالأمانة، فأبت. وقال للأرض فأبت، وقال للـجبـال فأبت، وقال لقابـيـل، فقال: نعم تذهب وترجع وتـجد أهلك كما يسرّك. فلـما انطلق آدم قرّبـا قربـاناً، وكان قابـيـل يفخر علـيه، فقال: أنا أحقّ بها منك، هي أختـي، وأنا أكبر منك، وأنا وصيّ والديّ. فلـما قرّبـا، قرّب هابـيـل جذعة سمينة، وقرّب قابـيـل حُزمة سنبل، فوجد فـيها سنبلة عظيـمة ففركها فأكلها. فنزلت النار فأكلت قربـان هابـيـل، وتركت قربـان قابـيـل، فغضب وقال: لأقتلنك حتـى لا تنكح أختـي فقال هابـيـل { إنَّـمَا يَتَقَبَّلُ اللَّهُ مِنَ الـمُتَّقِـينَ }.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was narrated from as-Suddi, in his narration from Abu Maalik and from Abu Saalih from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Murrah from Ibn Mas‘ood, and from some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): No son was born to Adam but a daughter would be born with him, and the boy from this pregnancy would marry the girl from another pregnancy, and the girl from this pregnancy would marry a boy from another pregnancy. This continued till two boys Qabeel and Habeel were born. Qabeel was a grower of crops, and Habeel kept the livestock of animals. Qabeel was the elder one, and the sister that was born along with him was more beautiful than the girl who was born along with Habeel. When Habeel wished to marry the sister of Qabeel, then Qabeel refused to accept it and said: &quot;She is my sister as she was born along with me, and she is more beautiful than your sister, and thus I have more right to marry her. But his father (i.e. Adam) ordered him to let Habeel marry her, but Qabeel still refused. And both of them offered a sacrifice to see who had more right upon that girl ... &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habeel offered a fat lamb as offering, while Qabeel offered a sheaf of corn, but took out a big corn from it and ate it. Fire came down (from heaven) and consumed the offering of Habeel, but not that of Qaabeel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; [i.e., Haabeel’s offering was accepted and Qaabeel’s was not]. Upon that Qabeel became angry and he said: &quot;I will certainly kill you, and you will not be able to marry my sister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220428104808/https://dorar.net/h/808e9bbf2bff4252bd3830e50578ec2d&quot;&gt;Sahih (Albani)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId205296&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Agriculture also started only 10 thousand years ago&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of agriculture, including the cultivation of crops, began only around 10 thousand years ago during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic&quot;&gt;Neolithic Period&lt;/a&gt;, which followed the end of the ice age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this historical evidence, both the Bible and the Quran assert that Adam initiated agriculture upon his arrival on Earth. In verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/5.27&quot;&gt;5:27&lt;/a&gt; of the Quran, along with its commentary by Ibn Jarir Tabari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;amp;tAyahNo=27&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), multiple traditions are recorded describing how Qabeel (son of Adam) offered a part of his crop as a 'sacrifice' to Allah, while his brother Habeel presented a sheep for the same purpose. Similarly, other traditions mentioned by Ibn Kathir discuss the sacrifice of sheep and crops by the sons of Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the cultivation of crops and the presence of domestic sheep also prove that the story of Adam cannot be older than 10 thousand years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId234201&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Bible, Quran, and other religious texts make no mention of the 'Ice Age.'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ice Age (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), which concluded approximately 10 thousand years ago, finds no reference in these ancient scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of such knowledge can be attributed to the fact that these religious texts were authored much more recently than 10 thousand years ago. Consequently, their human creators lacked awareness of events that transpired thousands of years before their time, including the Stone Age and the Ice Age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, humans began utilizing iron a mere 3500 years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), marking the inception of the Iron Age. Before that, approximately 5500 years ago, they had discovered bronze, leading to what is known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age&quot;&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preceding the Bronze Age was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic&quot;&gt;Copper Age&lt;/a&gt;, bridging the gap between the Stone Age and the Bronze Age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Homo species began crafting tools from stone around 2.5 million years ago, a practice that persisted until about 10 thousand years ago. Subsequently, the Stone Age transitioned into the Copper Age, during which humans adopted the use of copper for toolmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId159179&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The challenge of Noah's Ark for Muslims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the bible, the gap between Adam and Noah was 1056 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this gap is the same according to Islam too. Saudi Salafi Mufti at Islam Question Answer wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20141226115909/http://islamqa.info/en/20907&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period between Adam and Nooh (peace be upon them both): it was narrated from Abu Umaamah that a man said: “O Messenger of Allaah, was Adam a Prophet?” He said, “Yes, and Allaah spoke to him.” The man asked, “How much (time) was there between him and Nooh?” He said, “Ten centuries.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his &lt;i&gt;Saheeh&lt;/i&gt;, 14/69; and by al-Haakim, 2/262. He said it is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Ibn Katheer said in &lt;i&gt;al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah&lt;/i&gt; (1/94): this is (saheeh) according to the conditions of Muslim, even though he did not narrate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the fossils of modern humans and other homos compel Muslims to claim that Adam came at least 300,000 years ago, but on the other hand, they are unable to tell how Noah could have constructed such a massive vessel using only stone and bone tools..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Quran, Noah's Ark is described as being made of &quot;&lt;strong&gt;planks&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;nails&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; (Quran 54:13), implying that it was not a primitive construction from the Stone Age. Instead, it suggests the use of more advanced materials like wood, indicating a level of technology beyond that of the Stone Age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/54.13&quot;&gt;54:13&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;And We carried him on (ark) made of planks and nails,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Muhammad came only 1400 years ago, and till his time, iron nails were available and used for naval shipbuilding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dilemma arises from the immense size of the ark, which was tasked with carrying pairs of animals from across the entire world, along with their food and water. Such an undertaking would require modern technology and tools, and even with today's technology, the largest wooden ship is only about 100 meters long. Furthermore, modern ships of this size rely on iron nails and steel wires to hold the planks together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the modern technology of today, the biggest ship, which is made out of wood, is only 100 meters long (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151013170709/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), even though not only a lot of iron nails have been used in it, but they also had to use steel wires in order to keep the planks together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question remains: how could Noah have built such a colossal ark 300,000 years ago without access to the technology we have today, including iron wires or ropes? This paradox raises intriguing challenges for Muslims seeking to reconcile the traditional timeline with the account of Noah's Ark as described in their religious texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId175121&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The oldest naval Ship is only 5 thousand years old&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the issues faced by Muslims is related to the age of the oldest naval ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to scientific discoveries (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship#History&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), the oldest known naval ship is approximately 5 thousand years old, and it was built by the ancient Egyptians. These early Egyptian ships were quite rudimentary, constructed with planks for the hulls and tied together with ropes since the technology for making nails was not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have come across numerous paintings depicting these early naval ships, which are around 5 thousand years old. However, there is a significant absence of any paintings representing more advanced ships older than 5 thousand years. Additionally, there are no 'cave paintings' featuring any type of naval ship, despite the existence of cave paintings dating back as far as 50,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, this raises questions for Muslims seeking to reconcile the age of the oldest naval ship with their historical and religious beliefs. The evidence points to the fact that advanced shipbuilding techniques and representations of such ships did not exist before the time of the early Egyptian vessels, further challenging traditional narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an image of an Egyptian boat from about 4 thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Egyptian boats&quot; src=&quot;https://heartheboatsing.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/pic-42.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Egyptian boat building about 4000 years ago&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;415&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Egyptian boats were the most advanced boats in the world from 4000 to 5000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId982187&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamic claim: Humans have been decreasing in stature (height) since Adam's creation, who was 60 cubits tall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad claimed that Adam was 60 cubits tall, and the height of humans has been progressively decreasing since Adam's creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3326&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3326&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &quot;Allah created Adam, making him 60 cubits tall ... Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad made such stories while he thought that no one was able to certify or deny such fairy tales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, modern science has provided evidence that contradicts these claims and has the capacity to verify or dismiss such assertions. Scientists have discovered human fossils dating back 300 thousand years, and all of them exhibit the typical height of present-day humans. Additionally, fossils of the Homo family, which go back as far as 3.4 million years, also demonstrate the same height as modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scientific findings challenge the notion that humans have been diminishing in stature since Adam's creation. As a result, it is essential to critically examine ancient beliefs in light of contemporary knowledge and evidence to achieve a deeper understanding of our history and origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The emergence of Neanderthals and Homo erectus has led Islamic preachers to assert a new, implausible claim that Adam existed 1.8 million years ago&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/human_evolution.png&quot; alt=&quot;Human Evolution&quot; width=&quot;714&quot; height=&quot;203&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; data-path=&quot;local-images:/human_evolution.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the earliest fossils of modern humans date back approximately 300,000 years, the earliest known Neanderthal-like fossils are around 0.5 million years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1 to 4 percent of the DNA in Europeans and Asians is identified as non-modern, sharing similarities with ancient Neanderthal DNA rather than that of Sub-Saharan Africans. Recent research even suggests a higher prevalence of Neanderthal genes in non-African humans than previously thought, with approximately 20% of the Neanderthal gene pool found in a broad sample of non-African individuals. Despite this, each individual's genome averages only 2% Neanderthal (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of Neanderthals prompted creationists, including Islamic preachers, to argue that Neanderthals were not a distinct species but rather humans. Consequently, they claim that Adam existed 0.5 million years ago. According to this perspective, humans supposedly endured the Stone Age for half a million years, utilizing only tools crafted from stones and bones, and emerged from this era only 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the narrative did not conclude with Neanderthals. Human-like fossils of Homo erectus, dating back 1.8 million years, compelled creationists to assert that Adam existed 1.8 million years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icr.org/article/homo-erectus-the-ape-man-that-wasnt&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;). This claim becomes even more absurd, as it implies, according to creationists, that humans persisted in the Stone Age for 1.8 million years, relying solely on tools fashioned from stones and bones, and transitioned out of this era only 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId502859&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, modern science has presented significant challenges for Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Muslims adhere to their traditions and early scholars, accepting that Adam arrived 6000 years ago, the discovery of 300 thousand years old fossils of modern humans directly contradicts their beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, if Muslims contend that Adam existed 300 thousand years ago, inconsistencies arise when examining the story of Adam's son and the development of cultivation and herding practices. Furthermore, it raises questions about why Adam's descendants remained in the Stone Age for the subsequent 290 thousand years and how Noah managed to construct such an enormous ark during that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conflicting narratives create dilemmas for Muslims, which they are unable to solve. &lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Science and Islam present contrasting views regarding the nature of the sky:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to scientific understanding, the concept of a physical sky does not exist. The blue appearance of the daytime sky is merely a result of our eyes perceiving the scattering of shorter wavelengths of sunlight by air molecules. Beyond this visual deception, there is only dark space in the universe, which remains imperceptible to our vision. During nighttime, the sky appears dark as there is no presence of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Islam asserts that the sky is a tangible, physical object. It describes the existence of seven skies where various prophets reside alongside their respective nations. Furthermore, each heaven is said to have physical gates guarded by angels, serving as passages to move from one sky to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These contrasting views reflect the difference in perspective between science and religious beliefs concerning the nature of the sky and its role within the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us see the following Hadith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:349&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 349&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, &quot; ... (On the night of night journey, Gabriel) took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven (i.e. the 1st heaven). When I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered: 'Gabriel.' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel replied, 'Yes, Muhammad is with me.' He asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people ... he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. ... ' Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: &quot;Abu Dhar added that the Prophet (ﷺ) met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) met Adam on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. ... Then Gabriel took me till we '' reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundary) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This same concept of a physical solid sky has been repeated in the Quran multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/34.9&quot;&gt;34:9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;See they not what is before them and behind them, of the sky and the earth? If We wished, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, &lt;strong&gt;or cause a piece of the sky to fall upon them&lt;/strong&gt;. Verily in this is a Sign for every devotee that turns to Allah (Translated by Yousuf Ali). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/31.10&quot;&gt;31:10&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;He created the heavens without any pillars visible to you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/22.65&quot;&gt;22:65&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Have you not seen how Allah has subjected to you all that is in the earth, and the vessels that sail in the sea by His command,&lt;strong&gt; and it is He (Allah) Who holds back the sky that it may not fall on earth&lt;/strong&gt; except by His leave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/67.3?context=5&quot;&gt;67:3-5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ طِبَاقًا ۖ مَّا &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تَرَىٰ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; فِى خَلْقِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ مِن تَفَٰوُتٍ ۖ فَٱرْجِعِ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلْبَصَرَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; هَلْ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تَرَىٰ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; مِن فُطُورٍ ثُمَّ ٱرْجِعِ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلْبَصَرَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; كَرَّتَيْنِ يَنقَلِبْ إِلَيْكَ &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;ٱلْبَصَرُ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; خَاسِئًا وَهُوَ حَسِيرٌ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;[And] who created seven heavens in layers. You do not &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return [your] &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [to the sky]; do you &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; any breaks? Then return [your] &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; twice again. [Your] &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will return to you humbled while it is fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thus, the Quran claims that we can see the sky with our human eyes, and no matter how many times we look at the sky, we won't find any cracks in it. However, according to science, as far as the reach of the human eye is concerned, there is only darkness, and there is no solid and crack-free sky that we can look at two or three times to confirm that such a solid and crack-free sky exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3&quot;&gt;17:90-93&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, &quot;We will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring. Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] &lt;strong&gt;Or you make the SKY FALL UPON US IN FRAGMENTS AS YOU HAVE CLAIMED&lt;/strong&gt; or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] &lt;strong&gt;or you ascend into the sky.&lt;/strong&gt; And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read.&quot;  Say: &quot;Glory to my Lord. I am only man and a messenger.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In this verse, the Quran mentions the dialogue of polytheists (Quraish) who challenge Muhammad to do these miracles to prove he's a prophet, Muhammad replies that he can't cuz he's just a &quot;human&quot;. However, one thing to note here is that one of the challenges put forward by the Quraish is &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Make the (physical solid) sky fall upon us in pieces as you have claimed&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. The Meccans are asking Muhammad to make the sky&lt;strong&gt; literally &lt;/strong&gt;fall on them because he had CLAIMED to do so (in the verse mentioned above). This shows that even the Quraish understood it &lt;strong&gt;literally&lt;/strong&gt; that sky is a solid physical object, and Allah doesn't respond by saying that &quot;&lt;strong&gt;It was a Metaphor&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; but instead replies by saying that Muhammad is just a human so he can't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/52.44&quot;&gt;52:44&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ كِسْفًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ سَاقِطًا يَقُولُوا۟ سَحَابٌ مَّرْكُومٌ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;{ even if they were to see some&lt;strong&gt; fragments of the sky falling down&lt;/strong&gt; they would still say: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;It is only a mass of cloud.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”} &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Here are a few more verses, which repeat the same concept of a solid physical sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/82.1&quot;&gt;82:1&lt;/a&gt;: إِذَا ٱلسَّمَآءُ ٱنفَطَرَتْ {When the sky breaks apart} ... (i.e. only a PHYSICAL object can break)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/21.104&quot;&gt;21:104&lt;/a&gt;: يَوْمَ نَطْوِى ٱلسَّمَآءَ كَطَىِّ ٱلسِّجِلِّ لِلْكُتُبِ ۚ {The day We shall roll up the heavens like a written scroll } ... (i.e. only a physical object can be &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/50.06&quot;&gt;50.06&lt;/a&gt;: أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَٰهَا وَزَيَّنَّٰهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ {Did they never observe the sky above them: how We built it and beautified it; and it has no cracks;} ... (i.e. cracks can only be present in a phyisical object, not in the space). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/78.19&quot;&gt;78:19&lt;/a&gt;: وَفُتِحَتِ ٱلسَّمَآءُ فَكَانَتْ أَبْوَٰبًا {and when the sky shall be opened up and will become all doors;} ... (i.e. only a physical object can be opened and becomes a door)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran 70:8-9: يَوْمَ تَكُونُ ٱلسَّمَآءُ كَٱلْمُهْلِ وَتَكُونُ ٱلْجِبَالُ كَٱلْعِهْنِ {The day the sky becomes like molten copper, and the mountains will become like dyed tufts of wool} ... (i.e. only a physical object can become like a molten copper).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/15.14?context=3&quot;&gt;15:13-15&lt;/a&gt;: وَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَابًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَظَلُّوا۟ فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ {They will not believe in it (i.e. the Message), while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Even if We open a door in the heavens and they ascend through it in broad daylight&lt;/span&gt;. Even then they would say, “Our sights have been hypnotised – in fact, a magic spell has been cast upon us.”}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslim Excuses:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;1st Excuse: From sky, it means Celestial Bodies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamweb.Net, a prominent Islamic website, presents a single excuse for the phrase &quot;fragments from the sky&quot; in Quranic verses.  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190104172821/http://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/373417/allah-prevents-the-sky-from-falling-on-the-earth&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;DetailFont&quot; style=&quot;color: maroon; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Ibn ‘Aasshoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said in his Tafseer: “&lt;span class=&quot;DetailFont&quot; style=&quot;color: 6600cc;&quot;&gt;The term {… let fall upon them fragments from the sky} means, &lt;strong&gt;a piece of the celestial bodies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a significant flaw in using Ibn 'Aasshoor's interpretation as evidence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Tahir_ibn_Ashur&quot;&gt;Ibn Aasshoor (link)&lt;/a&gt; lived in the last century and relied on the understanding prevalent during his time. Modern science has since established that the concept of a physical sky does not exist, but rather, there is only space. As a result, Ibn 'Aasshoor's explanation attempts to reconcile the concept of a solid physical sky with the scientific understanding of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Islamic scholars interpreted the sky literally, understanding it as a physical entity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore,  clouds look similar to the sky to the naked eye. Thus, the Quran is very clear that the portions of the sky which will fall, will not be like any celestial body (like the sun or moon or stars), but they will look like clouds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/52.44&quot;&gt;52:44-45&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ كِسْفًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ سَاقِطًا يَقُولُوا۟ سَحَابٌ مَّرْكُومٌ فَذَرْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يُلَٰقُوا۟ يَوْمَهُمُ ٱلَّذِى فِيهِ يُصْعَقُونَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;{ Even if they were to see &lt;strong&gt;some fragments of the sky&lt;/strong&gt; falling down they would still say: “&lt;strong&gt;It is only a mass of cloud&lt;/strong&gt;. So, leave them until they face their day (of doom) when they will be stunned.} &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thus, from this verse, we can conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The falling of the sky is not metaphorical, but it is real. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And these fragments will not look like celestial bodies (sun, moon, meteors) but like a mass of clouds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;polytheists will not die, but survive its destruction although whole fragments (of the size of mass clouds) will fall so near to them that they will be able to see them from their eyes&lt;/span&gt; and thus they will claim that these fragments of the sky are only a mass of clouds. Actually, this is a scientific blunder of the Quran, as if the sky, or even a celestial body of this mass, fells on the earth, then the whole world will destroy and no one will survive. But obviously, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) was free to make such fantasy stories, as people of the time of ignorance were unable to catch his lies. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2nd Excuse: Mohammad Hijab claims that the Quran does not say that sky is a solid object&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Mohammad Hijab, a prominent Islamic apologist, offers only two excuses in his video to defend the Quranic passage about the sky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;width: 388px; height: 218px;&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuL7S9z7jCw&quot; width=&quot;388&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So, Mohammad Hijab was able to present only TWO excuses in this whole video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1st excuse he made is of Ibn 'Aasshoor that he claimed from the sky it could mean celestial bodies. But we have already answered regarding Ibn 'Aaashoor above. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the 2nd excuse that Mohammad Hijab made, is when he argued: &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;If really the Quran's picture of heaven is that of a solid object, my question to this how could the prophet (saw) went on Miraj (i.e. &lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem; color: #e67e23;&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isra%27_and_Mi%27raj&quot;&gt;the Night Journey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;) through a solid object.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already presented the Hadith of Night Journey from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:349&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 349&lt;/a&gt; above. According to this Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sky is a PHYSICAL Object. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 7 skies where different prophets are living along with their nations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And there are PHYSICAL Gates in every heaven, which are guarded by angels. You have to pass through these gates if you want to go from one sky to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Mohammad Hijab is thus refuting his own prophet by making such a claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Quranic verse 15:13-15 presents a scenario where people, even if shown a door in the heavens to ascend through during daylight, would still reject the message, dismissing it as a magical illusion. This verse reinforces the Quran's depiction of the sky as a physical entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/15.14?context=3&quot;&gt;15:13-15&lt;/a&gt;: وَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَابًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَظَلُّوا۟ فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ {They will not believe in it (i.e. the Message), while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Even if We open a door in the heavens and they ascend through it in broad daylight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Even then they would say, “Our sights have been hypnotised – in fact, a magic spell has been cast upon us.”}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islamic apologists are unable to present any other excuse, except these two excuses. They are in a very helpless position, as this is the best what Islamic apologists can do to defend this scientific blunder of the Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please don't forget, Islam claims that Allah is 100% PERFECT. This means, even if there occurs a SINGLE mistake by Allah, then the remaining 99.99% of Islam will also be automatically demolished. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Science and Islam present contrasting views regarding the nature of the sky:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to scientific understanding, the concept of a physical sky does not exist. The blue appearance of the daytime sky is merely a result of our eyes perceiving the scattering of shorter wavelengths of sunlight by air molecules. Beyond this visual deception, there is only dark space in the universe, which remains imperceptible to our vision. During nighttime, the sky appears dark as there is no presence of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Islam asserts that the sky is a tangible, physical object. It describes the existence of seven skies where various prophets reside alongside their respective nations. Furthermore, each heaven is said to have physical gates guarded by angels, serving as passages to move from one sky to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These contrasting views reflect the difference in perspective between science and religious beliefs concerning the nature of the sky and its role within the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us see the following Hadith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:349&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 349&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, &quot; ... (On the night of night journey, Gabriel) took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven (i.e. the 1st heaven). When I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered: 'Gabriel.' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel replied, 'Yes, Muhammad is with me.' He asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people ... he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. ... ' Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: &quot;Abu Dhar added that the Prophet (ﷺ) met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) met Adam on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. ... Then Gabriel took me till we '' reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundary) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This same concept of a physical solid sky has been repeated in the Quran multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/34.9&quot;&gt;34:9&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;See they not what is before them and behind them, of the sky and the earth? If We wished, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, &lt;strong&gt;or cause a piece of the sky to fall upon them&lt;/strong&gt;. Verily in this is a Sign for every devotee that turns to Allah (Translated by Yousuf Ali). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/31.10&quot;&gt;31:10&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;He created the heavens without any pillars visible to you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/22.65&quot;&gt;22:65&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Have you not seen how Allah has subjected to you all that is in the earth, and the vessels that sail in the sea by His command,&lt;strong&gt; and it is He (Allah) Who holds back the sky that it may not fall on earth&lt;/strong&gt; except by His leave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/67.3?context=5&quot;&gt;67:3-5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ طِبَاقًا ۖ مَّا &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تَرَىٰ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; فِى خَلْقِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ مِن تَفَٰوُتٍ ۖ فَٱرْجِعِ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلْبَصَرَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; هَلْ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;تَرَىٰ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; مِن فُطُورٍ ثُمَّ ٱرْجِعِ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ٱلْبَصَرَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; كَرَّتَيْنِ يَنقَلِبْ إِلَيْكَ &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;ٱلْبَصَرُ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; خَاسِئًا وَهُوَ حَسِيرٌ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;[And] who created seven heavens in layers. You do not &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return [your] &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [to the sky]; do you &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; any breaks? Then return [your] &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; twice again. [Your] &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0034;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will return to you humbled while it is fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thus, the Quran claims that we can see the sky with our human eyes, and no matter how many times we look at the sky, we won't find any cracks in it. However, according to science, as far as the reach of the human eye is concerned, there is only darkness, and there is no solid and crack-free sky that we can look at two or three times to confirm that such a solid and crack-free sky exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/17.90?context=3&quot;&gt;17:90-93&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And they (the polytheists of Quraish) say, &quot;We will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring. Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] &lt;strong&gt;Or you make the SKY FALL UPON US IN FRAGMENTS AS YOU HAVE CLAIMED&lt;/strong&gt; or you bring Allah and the angels before [us] Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] &lt;strong&gt;or you ascend into the sky.&lt;/strong&gt; And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read.&quot;  Say: &quot;Glory to my Lord. I am only man and a messenger.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In this verse, the Quran mentions the dialogue of polytheists (Quraish) who challenge Muhammad to do these miracles to prove he's a prophet, Muhammad replies that he can't cuz he's just a &quot;human&quot;. However, one thing to note here is that one of the challenges put forward by the Quraish is &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Make the (physical solid) sky fall upon us in pieces as you have claimed&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. The Meccans are asking Muhammad to make the sky&lt;strong&gt; literally &lt;/strong&gt;fall on them because he had CLAIMED to do so (in the verse mentioned above). This shows that even the Quraish understood it &lt;strong&gt;literally&lt;/strong&gt; that sky is a solid physical object, and Allah doesn't respond by saying that &quot;&lt;strong&gt;It was a Metaphor&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; but instead replies by saying that Muhammad is just a human so he can't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/52.44&quot;&gt;52:44&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ كِسْفًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ سَاقِطًا يَقُولُوا۟ سَحَابٌ مَّرْكُومٌ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;{ even if they were to see some&lt;strong&gt; fragments of the sky falling down&lt;/strong&gt; they would still say: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;It is only a mass of cloud.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”} &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Here are a few more verses, which repeat the same concept of a solid physical sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/82.1&quot;&gt;82:1&lt;/a&gt;: إِذَا ٱلسَّمَآءُ ٱنفَطَرَتْ {When the sky breaks apart} ... (i.e. only a PHYSICAL object can break)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/21.104&quot;&gt;21:104&lt;/a&gt;: يَوْمَ نَطْوِى ٱلسَّمَآءَ كَطَىِّ ٱلسِّجِلِّ لِلْكُتُبِ ۚ {The day We shall roll up the heavens like a written scroll } ... (i.e. only a physical object can be &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/50.06&quot;&gt;50.06&lt;/a&gt;: أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَٰهَا وَزَيَّنَّٰهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ {Did they never observe the sky above them: how We built it and beautified it; and it has no cracks;} ... (i.e. cracks can only be present in a phyisical object, not in the space). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/78.19&quot;&gt;78:19&lt;/a&gt;: وَفُتِحَتِ ٱلسَّمَآءُ فَكَانَتْ أَبْوَٰبًا {and when the sky shall be opened up and will become all doors;} ... (i.e. only a physical object can be opened and becomes a door)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran 70:8-9: يَوْمَ تَكُونُ ٱلسَّمَآءُ كَٱلْمُهْلِ وَتَكُونُ ٱلْجِبَالُ كَٱلْعِهْنِ {The day the sky becomes like molten copper, and the mountains will become like dyed tufts of wool} ... (i.e. only a physical object can become like a molten copper).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/15.14?context=3&quot;&gt;15:13-15&lt;/a&gt;: وَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَابًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَظَلُّوا۟ فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ {They will not believe in it (i.e. the Message), while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Even if We open a door in the heavens and they ascend through it in broad daylight&lt;/span&gt;. Even then they would say, “Our sights have been hypnotised – in fact, a magic spell has been cast upon us.”}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muslim Excuses:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;1st Excuse: From sky, it means Celestial Bodies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamweb.Net, a prominent Islamic website, presents a single excuse for the phrase &quot;fragments from the sky&quot; in Quranic verses.  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190104172821/http://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/373417/allah-prevents-the-sky-from-falling-on-the-earth&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;DetailFont&quot; style=&quot;color: maroon; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Ibn ‘Aasshoor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said in his Tafseer: “&lt;span class=&quot;DetailFont&quot; style=&quot;color: 6600cc;&quot;&gt;The term {… let fall upon them fragments from the sky} means, &lt;strong&gt;a piece of the celestial bodies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a significant flaw in using Ibn 'Aasshoor's interpretation as evidence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Tahir_ibn_Ashur&quot;&gt;Ibn Aasshoor (link)&lt;/a&gt; lived in the last century and relied on the understanding prevalent during his time. Modern science has since established that the concept of a physical sky does not exist, but rather, there is only space. As a result, Ibn 'Aasshoor's explanation attempts to reconcile the concept of a solid physical sky with the scientific understanding of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Islamic scholars interpreted the sky literally, understanding it as a physical entity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore,  clouds look similar to the sky to the naked eye. Thus, the Quran is very clear that the portions of the sky which will fall, will not be like any celestial body (like the sun or moon or stars), but they will look like clouds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/52.44&quot;&gt;52:44-45&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ كِسْفًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ سَاقِطًا يَقُولُوا۟ سَحَابٌ مَّرْكُومٌ فَذَرْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يُلَٰقُوا۟ يَوْمَهُمُ ٱلَّذِى فِيهِ يُصْعَقُونَ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;{ Even if they were to see &lt;strong&gt;some fragments of the sky&lt;/strong&gt; falling down they would still say: “&lt;strong&gt;It is only a mass of cloud&lt;/strong&gt;. So, leave them until they face their day (of doom) when they will be stunned.} &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Thus, from this verse, we can conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The falling of the sky is not metaphorical, but it is real. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And these fragments will not look like celestial bodies (sun, moon, meteors) but like a mass of clouds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;polytheists will not die, but survive its destruction although whole fragments (of the size of mass clouds) will fall so near to them that they will be able to see them from their eyes&lt;/span&gt; and thus they will claim that these fragments of the sky are only a mass of clouds. Actually, this is a scientific blunder of the Quran, as if the sky, or even a celestial body of this mass, fells on the earth, then the whole world will destroy and no one will survive. But obviously, the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) was free to make such fantasy stories, as people of the time of ignorance were unable to catch his lies. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;2nd Excuse: Mohammad Hijab claims that the Quran does not say that sky is a solid object&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Mohammad Hijab, a prominent Islamic apologist, offers only two excuses in his video to defend the Quranic passage about the sky:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;So, Mohammad Hijab was able to present only TWO excuses in this whole video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1st excuse he made is of Ibn 'Aasshoor that he claimed from the sky it could mean celestial bodies. But we have already answered regarding Ibn 'Aaashoor above. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the 2nd excuse that Mohammad Hijab made, is when he argued: &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;If really the Quran's picture of heaven is that of a solid object, my question to this how could the prophet (saw) went on Miraj (i.e. &lt;a style=&quot;font-size: 1rem; color: #e67e23;&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isra%27_and_Mi%27raj&quot;&gt;the Night Journey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;) through a solid object.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already presented the Hadith of Night Journey from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:349&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 349&lt;/a&gt; above. According to this Hadith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sky is a PHYSICAL Object. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 7 skies where different prophets are living along with their nations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And there are PHYSICAL Gates in every heaven, which are guarded by angels. You have to pass through these gates if you want to go from one sky to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Mohammad Hijab is thus refuting his own prophet by making such a claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Quranic verse 15:13-15 presents a scenario where people, even if shown a door in the heavens to ascend through during daylight, would still reject the message, dismissing it as a magical illusion. This verse reinforces the Quran's depiction of the sky as a physical entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/15.14?context=3&quot;&gt;15:13-15&lt;/a&gt;: وَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَابًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَظَلُّوا۟ فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ {They will not believe in it (i.e. the Message), while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Even if We open a door in the heavens and they ascend through it in broad daylight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Even then they would say, “Our sights have been hypnotised – in fact, a magic spell has been cast upon us.”}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islamic apologists are unable to present any other excuse, except these two excuses. They are in a very helpless position, as this is the best what Islamic apologists can do to defend this scientific blunder of the Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please don't forget, Islam claims that Allah is 100% PERFECT. This means, even if there occurs a SINGLE mistake by Allah, then the remaining 99.99% of Islam will also be automatically demolished. &lt;/li&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Please note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of the earlier Muslim scientists ever claimed to derive scientific discoveries directly from the Quran or Hadith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muslims were initially introduced to Greek/Roman scientific works through their conquests in Egypt and other regions. Later, Abbasid Caliph Mamun (d. 213 Hijri year) ordered the translation of these works into Arabic. Only after this development did Muslim scientists begin to emerge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muslims assert that the Sahaba (companions) of Muhammad were the best of Muslim generations. However, despite reading the Quran and Hadith throughout their lives, the Sahaba and the subsequent 5 to 10 Muslim generations were unable to extract any scientific knowledge from the Quran and the Hadith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present-day Muslims also struggle to extract scientific discoveries directly from the Quran/Hadith, often relying on science to make new findings before connecting them to the Quran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Damages that Islam Inflicted upon the Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islam made the whole Islamic world get religious education like a donkey. As a result, Islam produced millions of Islamic Scholars in the last 1400 years, who were involved only in Fiqh and Sectarian fights. Compared to those millions of Islamic Scholars, Islam was unable to produce even a handful of scientists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And you will not see even a single woman in the list of those earlier Muslim scientists of the last 1400 years, while Islam considers women to be deficient in intelligence, and they had to stay at home in the name of &quot;Islamic Modesty&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, the prohibition of studying human anatomy by Islam, in the name of &quot;respect&quot; for the deceased hindered medical progress for centuries, impeding critical advancements in the medical field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then Islam also made life difficult for many Muslim scientists too due to their sects or atheist leanings. Ibn Sina was hiding his whole life, and he had to write his books in this state of hiding. Al-Razi was hit in his head by his own books in the mosque. Ibn-e-Rushd got the punishment for being an atheist. Yaqub al-Kindi lashed in public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In contemporary times, schools in Muslim countries continue to teach that Darwin's Theory of Evolution is incorrect, promoting the belief that humans were directly created by Allah and that Allah directly sent humans to the earth after a woman from the crooked rib of a man deceived him to eat the forbidden apple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various factors contributed to the Islamic Golden Age, which saw significant advancements in knowledge and scholarship. It is essential to recognize that this motivation to learn was not unique to Islam, and religion itself was not a necessary condition for intellectual progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crucial catalyst for this flourishing period was the inheritance and study of pre-Islamic texts, encompassing a wide array of subjects. Additionally, government support and sponsorship of scholars fostered an environment conducive to intellectual pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large trading networks facilitated the exchange of new information and technologies, contributing to the cross-fertilization of ideas. During the Islamic Golden Age, scholars from various backgrounds, not limited to Muslims, made valuable contributions. Although some individuals may have been contentious figures, their input was part of a broader tapestry of knowledge enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of the Islamic Golden Age extended beyond the Muslim world, greatly influencing Europe's subsequent advancements. Intellectual progress is often built upon the works of neighboring and past cultures, whether European, Chinese, Persian, Iraqi, Syrian, Roman, Greek, Indian, and beyond. This cross-cultural exchange is not something to be embarrassed about; instead, it should be celebrated as people learn and improve from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Quranic Scientific Mistake about the 12 Lunar Months</title>
		<link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://sachaai.com/03/index.php/en/scientific-mistakes-in-the-revelation/30-quranic-scientific-mistake-about-the-12-lunar-months"/>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Islamic calendar is based on a lunar system, consisting of 12 lunar months, with each month corresponding to one full orbit of the moon around the Earth, which takes approximately 29 to 30 days. Consequently, the Islamic Lunar Year comprises 355 days, completing 12 lunar cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a solar year is defined by one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun, taking 365 days to accomplish. The solar year is not directly related to the division of time into months, weeks, and days, which was initially established by societies following lunar calendars. Over time, these divisions were also incorporated into solar calendars for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the lunar year with its 12 months, the solar year is primarily divided into four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—which repeat at regular intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position of the sun significantly influences the changes that occur on Earth, impacting human life, agriculture, and various business activities. In contrast, the position of the moon has a comparatively minor impact on human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Since there is no All-Knowing Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was himself creating this religion of Islam and Quran, and he himself belonged to that culture of the time of ignorance, that is why Muhammad made this double mistake in Quran:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Firstly, Muhammad chose this faulty and deficient Lunar Calendar, instead of the solar calendar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;(Note: Solar Calendar was already present in the world at the time of Muhammad, but Muhammad didn’t know about it as he lived in an area where people were ignorant of the concept of solar year)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And moreover, Muhammad also made this claim in Quran that these&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;12 months&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; existed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;since the beginning of the universe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.36&quot;&gt;9:36&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;إِنَّ عِدَّةَ ٱلشُّهُورِ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْرًا فِى كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ مِنْهَآ أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْقَيِّمُ ۚ فَلَا تَظْلِمُوا۟ فِيهِنَّ أَنفُسَكُمْ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Indeed, the number of months with Allah is twelve [lunar] months in the register of Allah &lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;since &lt;/span&gt;the day He created the heavens and the earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; of these, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;four months are sacred&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. That is the correct religion, so do not wrong yourselves during them. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.36&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Translation by Sahih International&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;But how is it possible, while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;There existed no moon and earth, no day and night, no months and years at the beginning of the universe. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;The earth came into being only 9 billion years after the creation of the remaining universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;And the moon came into being even after planet Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;So, how is it possible that the &quot;System of the Universe&quot; revolved around 12 Lunar Months, since the beginning of the universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;But obviously, Muhammad didn’t know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What to talk about the lunar year, but even the solar year also has nothing to do with the system of the heavens, as the sun was also not present at the time of the creation of the universe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Liberation Sans, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;Day and Night&lt;/span&gt; in the Whole Universe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Similarly, look at Verse 79:27-29:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;أأنْتُم أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ بَناهَا* رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا* وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَاهَا* وَالأرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَاهَا* أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَها وَمَرْعَاهَا* وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَاهَا* مَتَاعاً لَّكُمْ وَلأنْعَامِكُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Is it harder to create you or the heaven? &lt;strong&gt;But Allah built it ,and raised its vault high and proportioned it; and covered its (i.e. the whole universe's) night with darkness and brought forth from it its day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of the Quran's composition, people believed in a single sun in the universe. Therefore, when the sun set, it was considered night on Earth as well as in the heavens. Similarly, when the sun rose, it signaled the start of the day on both Earth and in the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad seemingly fabricated this story about the heavens, thinking that no one would ever be able to scrutinize or question his claims. However, he was unaware that future advancements in science would enable investigations into these narratives, revealing them as nothing but falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The start of the “Weekly System” and Islam copying it from earlier cultures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system of 4 weeks in a month is flawed because a lunar month consists of approximately 29.53 days, making it impossible to evenly divide into 4 weeks. Despite this, the people of the time of ignorance adopted this faulty system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system can be traced back to its origins in Sumerian culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/45432-days-of-the-week.html&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/45432-days-of-the-week.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/45432-days-of-the-week.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The seven-day week originates from the calendar of the Babylonians, which in turn is based on a Sumerian calendar dated to 21st-century B.C. Seven days corresponds to the time it takes for a moon to transition between each phase: full, waning half, new and waxing half. Because the moon cycle is 29.53 days long, the Babylonians would insert one or two days into the final week of each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad then further claimed that the universe was created on different days of the week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151024181607/http://sunnah.com/muslim/52/10&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Book of creation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Haraira reported that Allah's Messenger took hold of my hands and said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, created the clay on &lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt; and He created the mountains on &lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt; and He created the trees on &lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt; and He created the things entailing labour on &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt; and created light on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt; and lie caused the animals to spread on &lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt; and created Adam (peace be upon him) after 'Asr on &lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;;the last creation at the last hour of the hours of Friday, i. e. between afternoon and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, neither the sun, nor the months, nor the weekdays existed at the time of the creation of the Universe. Thus, it is impossible that the creation started on any Saturday .....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad was only fabricating these false stories, as he thought no one is going to catch his lies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And moreover, Muhammad also made this claim in Quran that these&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e03e2d; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;12 months&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; existed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;since the beginning of the universe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.36&quot;&gt;9:36&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;إِنَّ عِدَّةَ ٱلشُّهُورِ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْرًا فِى كِتَٰبِ ٱللَّهِ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ مِنْهَآ أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْقَيِّمُ ۚ فَلَا تَظْلِمُوا۟ فِيهِنَّ أَنفُسَكُمْ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Indeed, the number of months with Allah is twelve [lunar] months in the register of Allah &lt;span style=&quot;color: #843fa1;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;since &lt;/span&gt;the day He created the heavens and the earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; of these, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;four months are sacred&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. That is the correct religion, so do not wrong yourselves during them. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.36&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Translation by Sahih International&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;But how is it possible, while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;There existed no moon and earth, no day and night, no months and years at the beginning of the universe. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;The earth came into being only 9 billion years after the creation of the remaining universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;And the moon came into being even after planet Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;So, how is it possible that the &quot;System of the Universe&quot; revolved around 12 Lunar Months, since the beginning of the universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;But obviously, Muhammad didn’t know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;What to talk about the lunar year, but even the solar year also has nothing to do with the system of the heavens, as the sun was also not present at the time of the creation of the universe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Liberation Sans, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;Day and Night&lt;/span&gt; in the Whole Universe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Similarly, look at Verse 79:27-29:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;أأنْتُم أَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ بَناهَا* رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا* وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَاهَا* وَالأرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَاهَا* أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَها وَمَرْعَاهَا* وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَاهَا* مَتَاعاً لَّكُمْ وَلأنْعَامِكُمْ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Is it harder to create you or the heaven? &lt;strong&gt;But Allah built it ,and raised its vault high and proportioned it; and covered its (i.e. the whole universe's) night with darkness and brought forth from it its day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time of the Quran's composition, people believed in a single sun in the universe. Therefore, when the sun set, it was considered night on Earth as well as in the heavens. Similarly, when the sun rose, it signaled the start of the day on both Earth and in the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad seemingly fabricated this story about the heavens, thinking that no one would ever be able to scrutinize or question his claims. However, he was unaware that future advancements in science would enable investigations into these narratives, revealing them as nothing but falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The start of the “Weekly System” and Islam copying it from earlier cultures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system of 4 weeks in a month is flawed because a lunar month consists of approximately 29.53 days, making it impossible to evenly divide into 4 weeks. Despite this, the people of the time of ignorance adopted this faulty system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system can be traced back to its origins in Sumerian culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/45432-days-of-the-week.html&quot;&gt;https://www.livescience.com/45432-days-of-the-week.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/45432-days-of-the-week.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The seven-day week originates from the calendar of the Babylonians, which in turn is based on a Sumerian calendar dated to 21st-century B.C. Seven days corresponds to the time it takes for a moon to transition between each phase: full, waning half, new and waxing half. Because the moon cycle is 29.53 days long, the Babylonians would insert one or two days into the final week of each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad then further claimed that the universe was created on different days of the week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151024181607/http://sunnah.com/muslim/52/10&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Book of creation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Haraira reported that Allah's Messenger took hold of my hands and said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, created the clay on &lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt; and He created the mountains on &lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt; and He created the trees on &lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt; and He created the things entailing labour on &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt; and created light on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt; and lie caused the animals to spread on &lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt; and created Adam (peace be upon him) after 'Asr on &lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;;the last creation at the last hour of the hours of Friday, i. e. between afternoon and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, neither the sun, nor the months, nor the weekdays existed at the time of the creation of the Universe. Thus, it is impossible that the creation started on any Saturday .....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad was only fabricating these false stories, as he thought no one is going to catch his lies. &lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the era of Muhammad and before him, people (including scientists like Aristotle) were literally of the opinion that it is the heart which is responsible for thinking and understanding and beliefs and faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no All-Knowing Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was himself making the religion in the name of Allah and the revelation. Since Muhammad was only a human (and not All-Knowing), thus he made a human mistake and repeated that common scientific mistake in the Quranic verses and Ahadith. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But science finally cleared all doubts in the 16th century, and established it without any doubts that it is not the heart, but the brain which thinks, reasons, understands etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But for Muslims, it was impossible to agree with science, while the Quran and Ahadith are clear that it is the heart which is responsible in the literal sense for thinking and understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, Muslim preachers of this century broke all records of their abilities to deceive people by making lame excuses. They twisted the scientific facts and came up with deceptive scientific claims that it is the heart which is responsible for thinking and understanding. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After this deception by Muslim preachers, it was no more a scientific mistake of the Quran, but it became a scientific MIRACLE of the Quran.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, such deceptions cannot last long, and sooner or later the truth becomes evident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science first made an artificial heart. And despite that artificial heart absolutely no change took place in the thinking, understanding, reasoning and beliefs of people. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, science also replaced the human heart with a genetically modified PIG heart. And now the centre of faith (Imaan إيمان) is the pig's heart. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad copied this scientific mistake only from our ancient ancestors, who were the first ones, who thought that it was the heart which was responsible for thinking, reasoning and wisdom. Adam Elmasri explains it in his video (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D90f3vlTvJI&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaker Naik didn’t realize that &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;he confirmed that the Quran fell into a widely spread common &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;mistake that mankind held as true since the dawn of time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This widely spread common mistake is known in history as “&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cardio-centric hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The cardio-centric hypothesis was the historical belief that the heart controls sensation, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;thought, and body movement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Cardio centrism was first derived from the ancient Egyptian belief that the heart was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;the house of thought and soul. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The ancient Egyptians believed that the heart rather than the brain was the source of human &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;wisdom and the centre of emotions and memory. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why, during the mummification process, the ancient Egyptians would take all the valuable organs out of the deceased body and preserve them in vessels next to the mummy. While they leave the heart and ONLY the heart inside the mummy. As for the brain, it was a useless organ. They didn’t preserve the brain. Rather, they used a hock shaped needle to take out the brain through the nose and dispose of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Egyptians, Ancient Mesopotamians too believed that the heart was the organ responsible for intellect and was in control of the motor and sensory systems. The heart, not the brain! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until the ancient Greeks that we find a division and controversy about the organ served as the seat of the soul and thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some favoured the heart or the cardiocentric view and among them was &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aristotle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Others favored the brain or the cephalocentric view and among them was Plato and Pythagoras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, throughout history, it was Aristotle's contributions that have been more influential than Plato’s, particularly when it comes to science and logical reasoning. So the wider spread idea through the ancient world, and the mainstream consensus was the idea that we think and understand by the heart rather than the brain!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0700ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It wasn’t really until the 16th century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that we came to understand the nervous system. And only in the last 100 years or so that we established Neuroscience or what we call Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you will find all the relevant references in the description box under the video (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D90f3vlTvJI&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So it is no surprise that all our human languages carry the evidence of our ignorance and the long-held wrong belief that we think, reason and comprehend by the heart. It is no wonder that nearly all languages have statements such as “memorized by heart” or “Love you from the bottom of my heart” – Because WE DID NOT KNOW, until very very recently that we love from the brain and we also memorize, think and understand from the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simply didn’t know. But, didn’t the creator of the universe know that? How could God fall into the same trap of human ignorance and send down a book saying verses like “They have hearts they do not understand with” and “they travelled the land so their hearts may reason”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn’t God of the Quran know that we think and reason by the brain? Isn’t it appropriate, that when God sends down a book to correct human mistakes rather than carry them on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there is no All-Knowing Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was himself making the religion in the name of Allah and the revelation. Since Muhammad was only a human (and not All-Knowing), thus he made a human mistake and repeated that common scientific mistake in the Quranic verses and Ahadith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.179&quot;&gt;7:179&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;They have hearts with which they do not understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/63.3&quot;&gt;63:3&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their &lt;strong&gt;hearts are sealed so that they understand not&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/22.46&quot;&gt;22:46&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Have they not journeyed in the land that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0700ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;their hearts might understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;their ears might listen&lt;/strong&gt;? For indeed it is not the eyes that are blinded; it is rather the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;hearts,&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; which are in the breasts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; that are rendered blind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim preacher Zakir Naik came up with an excuse that the &quot;heart&quot; in the Quran means only &quot;intelligence&quot;. But this verse refuted Zakir Naik completely when it says:  “...&lt;strong&gt; the hearts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;which are in the breasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, and we know that no intelligence is present in the &quot;breasts&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, all Ahadith of Muhummad are also proving that Muhammad was not talking in any figurative sense, but in the literal sense that it is the heart which is responsible for thinking, understanding and Faith (Imaan إيمان).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3346&quot;&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi, 3346&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet of Allah said: “While I was at the House, between sleeping and being awake, I heard someone saying: “The one in the middle of the three.’ I was brought a vessel of gold containing Zamzam water, so my chest was split, to here.’” – Qatadah said: “I said to Anas: ‘What does that mean?’ He said: ‘To the lowest part of his stomach.’” – He said: “&lt;strong&gt;So my heart was removed, and washed with Zamzam water, then returned to its placed&lt;/strong&gt;. Then I was filled with Faith and wisdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:52&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 52&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good (reformed) but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4244&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, 4244&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “When the believer commits sin, &lt;strong&gt;a black spot appears on his heart&lt;/strong&gt;. If he repents and gives up that sin and seeks forgiveness, his heart will be polished. But if (the sin) increases, (the black spot) increases. That is the Ran that Allah mentions in His Book: “Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn.” [83:14]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;Grade: Sahih (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230128215411/https://dorar.net/h/iM7ZnFuS?sims=1&quot;&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Al-Syuti. And Albani declared it Hasan. Nevertheless, Albani declared a similar hadith from Tariq bin Shihad to be &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern science contradicts the claims made by Muhammad and Allah regarding the hearts of individuals. According to scientific evidence, there are no black spots on the hearts, even of sinners, and the color of hearts is the same for Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad may have thought he could make unfounded claims about the heart without anyone verifying them. However, with the advancement of modern science, these claims were exposed as deceptive and scientifically incorrect. Science has been able to identify the scientific mistakes present in the teachings of Allah and Muhammad, challenging the validity of their assertions about the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hadithprophet.com/hadith-16523.html&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, 12381 &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن أنس قال: كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول: &quot; الإسلام علانية، والإيمان في القلب &quot; قال: ثم يشير بيده إلى صدره ثلاث مرات قال: ثم يقول: &quot; التقوى هاهنا، التقوى هاهنا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: &quot;Islam is an outward manifestation, and faith is in the heart.&quot; He then pointed towards his chest three times and said: &quot;And piety is here (in the heart).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, to support the Quranic verses and Hadiths, the Islamic preachers of this century have taken deception to new levels, transforming what is a scientific error into a supposed scientific miracle of the Quran. They have vigorously propagated this so-called miracle far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this Islamic preachers claims (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.letmeturnthetables.com/2008/10/is-heart-responsible-for-understanding.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that the heart communicates to the brain in four major ways: neurologically (through the transmission of nerve impulses), biochemically (via hormones and neurotransmitters), biophysically (through pressure waves) and energetically (through electromagnetic field interactions). Communication along all these conduits significantly affects the brain's activity. Moreover, our research shows that messages the heart sends the brain can also affect performance.

&lt;p&gt;Yasha Kresh, PhD, Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Medicine, Research Director of Cardiothoracic Surgery says: &quot;It turns out that the heart has its own 'brain' - an intrinsic nervous system. It's not clear what it does or if it's subservient to the higher brain. But it's clear that it is there, and I believe it has a mission because evolution does not allow things to remain without purpose. We think this internal nervous system helps to fine-tune and integrate the heart's diverse activity.&quot; [ Source : &lt;a href=&quot;http://husol.hahnemann.edu/chaosjk1.htm&quot;&gt;The Brain and Heart of Chaos, An interview with Dr. Yasha Kresh&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; padding: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnfull/20160622/382451?max=600&quot; width=&quot;265&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; class=&quot;float-none&quot; alt=&quot;The Artificial Hearts (and the heart of a Pig) beg to differ from these Islamic Preachers&quot;&gt;A person remarkably survived with a pig heart for two months (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/09/1085420836/pig-heart-transplant#:~:text=Press-,A%20man%20who%20got%20the%201st%20pig%20heart%20transplant%20has,heart%20transplant%20from%20a%20pig.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While others have thrived with artificial hearts for months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larkin, pictured above, a 25-year-old with a rare form of cardiomyopathy who lived for 555 days — outside of the hospital — using a Total Artificial Heart before receiving a heart transplant at UMHS in May. “He's absolutely thriving now.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/10/health/artificial-heart-555-days-transplant/index.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases demonstrate that people can still think, understand, reason, and exhibit cognitive behavior &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;without a human heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Muslim friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please think about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should we now believe that the center of faith lies within a pig's heart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or should we consider that artificial hearts (machines) govern our emotions, love, and reasoning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, let's address these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does receiving a non-Muslim's heart make a Muslim a non-believer (Kafir)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will a Muslim start adopting pig-like behavior after receiving a pig's heart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us reflect on these matters with an open mind and rational thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One more Muslim argument: Behavioral changes in heart transplant recipients reflecting their donors' personalities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MuslimSkeptic Website came up with this argument (&lt;a href=&quot;https://muslimskeptic.com/2022/06/20/heart-islam-scientism/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, three authors associated with American universities penned an article titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10882878/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changes in Heart Transplant Recipients That Parallel the Personalities of Their Donors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Integrative Medicine&lt;/em&gt; journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They studied &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;many cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and directly interviewed not only transplant recipients but also their families and friends, and also those of the donors. They claimed that the transplant recipient very often replicated some of the donor’s most unique behavioral traits – as if there was some sort of experiential or emotional transfer which had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They write: &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Two to 5 parallels per case were observed between changes following surgery and the histories of the donors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Parallels included changes in food, music, art, sexual, recreational, and career preferences, as well as specific instances of perceptions of names and sensory experiences related to the donors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (e.g., one donor was killed by a gun shot to the face; the recipient had dreams of seeing hot flashes of light in his face)&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved only 10 participants, making it a small and singular investigation. No further studies have replicated these findings since 2000, raising questions about its validity. While a professor wrote a book on this topic in 2020, it remains a hypothesis and not a comprehensive study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some Muslim preachers readily accept this singular hypothesis while rejecting the well-supported Theory of Evolution, which is based on numerous studies and overwhelming evidence. This inconsistency raises concerns about double standards in evaluating scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if these Muslim preachers believe in this study of so-called “cellular memory”, against all scientific standards, still how they cannot see that the influence of the heart is minimal to negligible on the thinking and reasoning ability of a person (even according to this study). In no way, it could be said that the heart is sealed, and thus a person loses his ability to make the right decision. The brain still stays the organ, which is responsible for thinking and reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muslim excuse: The heart controls emotions, and thus the heart controls the emotional decisions, not the brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Muslim preacher argued that the heart possesses neurons, an intrinsic nervous system, and maintains a &quot;Heart Brain Connection.&quot; According to this preacher, the heart controls emotions, leading to emotional decisions, and not the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, similar qualities can be found in other organs as well. For instance, the digestive system also contains neurons, an intrinsic nervous system, and communicates with the brain to influence emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain more insights, you can inquire the following questions from &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do emotions control the heart, or does the heart control emotions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the heart regulate the pain system, or is it controlled by the brain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the digestive system impact emotions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there neurons in the digestive system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the digestive system communicate with the brain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which organs possess an intrinsic nervous system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental questions remain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will a Muslim become a non-believer after receiving a non-believer's heart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will a Muslim start behaving like a pig after receiving a pig's heart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unfortunate that some Muslim preachers still claim that the Quran speaks the truth about the heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is disheartening to witness the immense power of propaganda wielded by these preachers, which continues to mislead and confuse millions of people on this matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is regrettable that we must still spend time refuting such baseless Quranic claims in the 21st century.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the era of Muhammad and before him, people (including scientists like Aristotle) were literally of the opinion that it is the heart which is responsible for thinking and understanding and beliefs and faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no All-Knowing Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was himself making the religion in the name of Allah and the revelation. Since Muhammad was only a human (and not All-Knowing), thus he made a human mistake and repeated that common scientific mistake in the Quranic verses and Ahadith. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But science finally cleared all doubts in the 16th century, and established it without any doubts that it is not the heart, but the brain which thinks, reasons, understands etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But for Muslims, it was impossible to agree with science, while the Quran and Ahadith are clear that it is the heart which is responsible in the literal sense for thinking and understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, Muslim preachers of this century broke all records of their abilities to deceive people by making lame excuses. They twisted the scientific facts and came up with deceptive scientific claims that it is the heart which is responsible for thinking and understanding. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After this deception by Muslim preachers, it was no more a scientific mistake of the Quran, but it became a scientific MIRACLE of the Quran.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, such deceptions cannot last long, and sooner or later the truth becomes evident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science first made an artificial heart. And despite that artificial heart absolutely no change took place in the thinking, understanding, reasoning and beliefs of people. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, science also replaced the human heart with a genetically modified PIG heart. And now the centre of faith (Imaan إيمان) is the pig's heart. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad copied this scientific mistake only from our ancient ancestors, who were the first ones, who thought that it was the heart which was responsible for thinking, reasoning and wisdom. Adam Elmasri explains it in his video (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D90f3vlTvJI&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaker Naik didn’t realize that &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;he confirmed that the Quran fell into a widely spread common &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;mistake that mankind held as true since the dawn of time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;This widely spread common mistake is known in history as “&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cardio-centric hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The cardio-centric hypothesis was the historical belief that the heart controls sensation, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;thought, and body movement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Cardio centrism was first derived from the ancient Egyptian belief that the heart was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;the house of thought and soul. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The ancient Egyptians believed that the heart rather than the brain was the source of human &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;wisdom and the centre of emotions and memory. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why, during the mummification process, the ancient Egyptians would take all the valuable organs out of the deceased body and preserve them in vessels next to the mummy. While they leave the heart and ONLY the heart inside the mummy. As for the brain, it was a useless organ. They didn’t preserve the brain. Rather, they used a hock shaped needle to take out the brain through the nose and dispose of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Egyptians, Ancient Mesopotamians too believed that the heart was the organ responsible for intellect and was in control of the motor and sensory systems. The heart, not the brain! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until the ancient Greeks that we find a division and controversy about the organ served as the seat of the soul and thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some favoured the heart or the cardiocentric view and among them was &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aristotle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Others favored the brain or the cephalocentric view and among them was Plato and Pythagoras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, throughout history, it was Aristotle's contributions that have been more influential than Plato’s, particularly when it comes to science and logical reasoning. So the wider spread idea through the ancient world, and the mainstream consensus was the idea that we think and understand by the heart rather than the brain!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0700ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It wasn’t really until the 16th century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that we came to understand the nervous system. And only in the last 100 years or so that we established Neuroscience or what we call Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you will find all the relevant references in the description box under the video (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D90f3vlTvJI&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So it is no surprise that all our human languages carry the evidence of our ignorance and the long-held wrong belief that we think, reason and comprehend by the heart. It is no wonder that nearly all languages have statements such as “memorized by heart” or “Love you from the bottom of my heart” – Because WE DID NOT KNOW, until very very recently that we love from the brain and we also memorize, think and understand from the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simply didn’t know. But, didn’t the creator of the universe know that? How could God fall into the same trap of human ignorance and send down a book saying verses like “They have hearts they do not understand with” and “they travelled the land so their hearts may reason”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn’t God of the Quran know that we think and reason by the brain? Isn’t it appropriate, that when God sends down a book to correct human mistakes rather than carry them on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there is no All-Knowing Allah present in the heavens, and Muhammad was himself making the religion in the name of Allah and the revelation. Since Muhammad was only a human (and not All-Knowing), thus he made a human mistake and repeated that common scientific mistake in the Quranic verses and Ahadith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/7.179&quot;&gt;7:179&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;They have hearts with which they do not understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/63.3&quot;&gt;63:3&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their &lt;strong&gt;hearts are sealed so that they understand not&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/22.46&quot;&gt;22:46&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Have they not journeyed in the land that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0700ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;their hearts might understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;their ears might listen&lt;/strong&gt;? For indeed it is not the eyes that are blinded; it is rather the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;hearts,&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; which are in the breasts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; that are rendered blind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim preacher Zakir Naik came up with an excuse that the &quot;heart&quot; in the Quran means only &quot;intelligence&quot;. But this verse refuted Zakir Naik completely when it says:  “...&lt;strong&gt; the hearts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;which are in the breasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, and we know that no intelligence is present in the &quot;breasts&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, all Ahadith of Muhummad are also proving that Muhammad was not talking in any figurative sense, but in the literal sense that it is the heart which is responsible for thinking, understanding and Faith (Imaan إيمان).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3346&quot;&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi, 3346&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prophet of Allah said: “While I was at the House, between sleeping and being awake, I heard someone saying: “The one in the middle of the three.’ I was brought a vessel of gold containing Zamzam water, so my chest was split, to here.’” – Qatadah said: “I said to Anas: ‘What does that mean?’ He said: ‘To the lowest part of his stomach.’” – He said: “&lt;strong&gt;So my heart was removed, and washed with Zamzam water, then returned to its placed&lt;/strong&gt;. Then I was filled with Faith and wisdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:52&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 52&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good (reformed) but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4244&quot;&gt;Sunan Ibn Majah, 4244&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “When the believer commits sin, &lt;strong&gt;a black spot appears on his heart&lt;/strong&gt;. If he repents and gives up that sin and seeks forgiveness, his heart will be polished. But if (the sin) increases, (the black spot) increases. That is the Ran that Allah mentions in His Book: “Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn.” [83:14]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;Grade: Sahih (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230128215411/https://dorar.net/h/iM7ZnFuS?sims=1&quot;&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Al-Syuti. And Albani declared it Hasan. Nevertheless, Albani declared a similar hadith from Tariq bin Shihad to be &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern science contradicts the claims made by Muhammad and Allah regarding the hearts of individuals. According to scientific evidence, there are no black spots on the hearts, even of sinners, and the color of hearts is the same for Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad may have thought he could make unfounded claims about the heart without anyone verifying them. However, with the advancement of modern science, these claims were exposed as deceptive and scientifically incorrect. Science has been able to identify the scientific mistakes present in the teachings of Allah and Muhammad, challenging the validity of their assertions about the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hadithprophet.com/hadith-16523.html&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, 12381 &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;عن أنس قال: كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول: &quot; الإسلام علانية، والإيمان في القلب &quot; قال: ثم يشير بيده إلى صدره ثلاث مرات قال: ثم يقول: &quot; التقوى هاهنا، التقوى هاهنا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: &quot;Islam is an outward manifestation, and faith is in the heart.&quot; He then pointed towards his chest three times and said: &quot;And piety is here (in the heart).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, to support the Quranic verses and Hadiths, the Islamic preachers of this century have taken deception to new levels, transforming what is a scientific error into a supposed scientific miracle of the Quran. They have vigorously propagated this so-called miracle far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this Islamic preachers claims (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.letmeturnthetables.com/2008/10/is-heart-responsible-for-understanding.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that the heart communicates to the brain in four major ways: neurologically (through the transmission of nerve impulses), biochemically (via hormones and neurotransmitters), biophysically (through pressure waves) and energetically (through electromagnetic field interactions). Communication along all these conduits significantly affects the brain's activity. Moreover, our research shows that messages the heart sends the brain can also affect performance. [ Source : &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartmath.org/research/science-of-the-heart/soh_20.html&quot;&gt;Science of The Heart:Exploring the Role of the Heart in Human Performance&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yasha Kresh, PhD, Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Medicine, Research Director of Cardiothoracic Surgery says: &quot;It turns out that the heart has its own 'brain' - an intrinsic nervous system. It's not clear what it does or if it's subservient to the higher brain. But it's clear that it is there, and I believe it has a mission because evolution does not allow things to remain without purpose. We think this internal nervous system helps to fine-tune and integrate the heart's diverse activity.&quot; [ Source : &lt;a href=&quot;http://husol.hahnemann.edu/chaosjk1.htm&quot;&gt;The Brain and Heart of Chaos, An interview with Dr. Yasha Kresh&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; padding: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnfull/20160622/382451?max=600&quot; width=&quot;265&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; class=&quot;float-none&quot; alt=&quot;The Artificial Hearts (and the heart of a Pig) beg to differ from these Islamic Preachers&quot;&gt;A person remarkably survived with a pig heart for two months (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/09/1085420836/pig-heart-transplant#:~:text=Press-,A%20man%20who%20got%20the%201st%20pig%20heart%20transplant%20has,heart%20transplant%20from%20a%20pig.&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While others have thrived with artificial hearts for months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larkin, pictured above, a 25-year-old with a rare form of cardiomyopathy who lived for 555 days — outside of the hospital — using a Total Artificial Heart before receiving a heart transplant at UMHS in May. “He's absolutely thriving now.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/10/health/artificial-heart-555-days-transplant/index.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases demonstrate that people can still think, understand, reason, and exhibit cognitive behavior &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;without a human heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Should we now believe that the center of faith lies within a pig's heart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or should we consider that artificial hearts (machines) govern our emotions, love, and reasoning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, let's address these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does receiving a non-Muslim's heart make a Muslim a non-believer (Kafir)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will a Muslim start adopting pig-like behavior after receiving a pig's heart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us reflect on these matters with an open mind and rational thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One more Muslim argument: Behavioral changes in heart transplant recipients reflecting their donors' personalities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MuslimSkeptic Website came up with this argument (&lt;a href=&quot;https://muslimskeptic.com/2022/06/20/heart-islam-scientism/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, three authors associated with American universities penned an article titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10882878/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changes in Heart Transplant Recipients That Parallel the Personalities of Their Donors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Integrative Medicine&lt;/em&gt; journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They studied &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;many cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and directly interviewed not only transplant recipients but also their families and friends, and also those of the donors. They claimed that the transplant recipient very often replicated some of the donor’s most unique behavioral traits – as if there was some sort of experiential or emotional transfer which had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They write: &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Two to 5 parallels per case were observed between changes following surgery and the histories of the donors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Parallels included changes in food, music, art, sexual, recreational, and career preferences, as well as specific instances of perceptions of names and sensory experiences related to the donors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; (e.g., one donor was killed by a gun shot to the face; the recipient had dreams of seeing hot flashes of light in his face)&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved only 10 participants, making it a small and singular investigation. No further studies have replicated these findings since 2000, raising questions about its validity. While a professor wrote a book on this topic in 2020, it remains a hypothesis and not a comprehensive study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some Muslim preachers readily accept this singular hypothesis while rejecting the well-supported Theory of Evolution, which is based on numerous studies and overwhelming evidence. This inconsistency raises concerns about double standards in evaluating scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if these Muslim preachers believe in this study of so-called “cellular memory”, against all scientific standards, still how they cannot see that the influence of the heart is minimal to negligible on the thinking and reasoning ability of a person (even according to this study). In no way, it could be said that the heart is sealed, and thus a person loses his ability to make the right decision. The brain still stays the organ, which is responsible for thinking and reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muslim excuse: The heart controls emotions, and thus the heart controls the emotional decisions, not the brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Muslim preacher argued that the heart possesses neurons, an intrinsic nervous system, and maintains a &quot;Heart Brain Connection.&quot; According to this preacher, the heart controls emotions, leading to emotional decisions, and not the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, similar qualities can be found in other organs as well. For instance, the digestive system also contains neurons, an intrinsic nervous system, and communicates with the brain to influence emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain more insights, you can inquire the following questions from &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do emotions control the heart, or does the heart control emotions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the heart regulate the pain system, or is it controlled by the brain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the digestive system impact emotions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there neurons in the digestive system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the digestive system communicate with the brain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which organs possess an intrinsic nervous system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental questions remain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will a Muslim become a non-believer after receiving a non-believer's heart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will a Muslim start behaving like a pig after receiving a pig's heart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unfortunate that some Muslim preachers still claim that the Quran speaks the truth about the heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is disheartening to witness the immense power of propaganda wielded by these preachers, which continues to mislead and confuse millions of people on this matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is regrettable that we must still spend time refuting such baseless Quranic claims in the 21st century.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;حَدَّثَنَا بِشْرُ بْنُ مُحَمَّدٍ، أَخْبَرَنَا عَبْدُ اللَّهِ، أَخْبَرَنَا مَعْمَرٌ، عَنْ هَمَّامٍ، عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم نَحْوَهُ يَعْنِي ‏ “‏ لَوْلاَ بَنُو إِسْرَائِيلَ لَمْ يَخْنَزِ اللَّحْمُ، وَلَوْلاَ حَوَّاءُ لَمْ تَخُنْ أُنْثَى زَوْجَهَا ‏”‏‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira:&lt;br /&gt;The Prophet (S) said, “If it was not for the Israelites, meat would not decay. And if it was not for Eve, wives would never betray their husbands.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunnah.com/bukhari/60/5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Saheeh Bukhari – Chapter: The creation of Adam and his offspring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَحَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ رَافِعٍ، حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الرَّزَّاقِ، أَخْبَرَنَا مَعْمَرٌ، عَنْ هَمَّامِ بْنِ مُنَبِّهٍ، قَالَ هَذَا مَا حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ، عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَذَكَرَ أَحَادِيثَ مِنْهَا وَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ “‏ لَوْلاَ بَنُو إِسْرَائِيلَ لَمْ يَخْبُثِ الطَّعَامُ وَلَمْ يَخْنَزِ اللَّحْمُ وَلَوْلاَ حَوَّاءُ لَمْ تَخُنْ أُنْثَى زَوْجَهَا الدَّهْرَ ‏”‏ ‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allah’s Messenger said: Had it not been for Bani Isra’il (the Israelites), food would not have become stale, and meat would not have gone bad; and had it not been for Eve, a woman would never have acted unfaithfully towards her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunnah.com/muslim/17/84&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Saheeh Muslim – Chapter: Were it not for Hawa’ (Eve), no female would ever betray her husband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we see that Muhammad has made clear that meat didn’t spoil prior to the time of the accursed Israelites. And since we know that these Israelites lived less than 4,000 years ago, it means that the meat-spoiling organisms could not possibly have existed more than 4,000 years ago either. But in reality these organism are up to 3 billions years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could see the list of these organism here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_spoilage&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_spoilage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are of 4 kinds: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;a title=&quot;Aerobic bacteria&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_bacteria&quot;&gt;Aerobic bacteria&lt;/a&gt; : They are about 101 million years old (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism?fbclid=IwAR3iQqk06TR-j8eqY4j4JloFVSKDLh1Eaz3q8jfbdE5hf4dFBAGssxKiXqg&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;a title=&quot;Yeast&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast&quot;&gt;Yeasts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Mold (fungus)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mold_(fungus)&quot;&gt;Molds&lt;/a&gt;: They are about 1 billion years old (&lt;a href=&quot;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-science-fungus-idUSKCN1SS29O%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Keylv89hxZIpzz8Ozc8aZCU9V1dSEUdJedU3WEKh-wK-V8CDCpVDFArA&amp;amp;h=AT2bxtThHlNP90P27tl0s2G5aO2-187EqS5cBphzQze83ReAS-DVMrYQsngv0jkee6cB68iVylgpRGA9Ga0yDkZuPKeknh5z45IVmvkWVKnDhOnYRoJ3xviomdMKcE9lcnfDjOBoL16_KurEVpxB&amp;amp;__tn__=R]-R&amp;amp;c[0]=AT1nzi11rw7w19LX-9lejlRORnyxpZieAANzGcxpECtZrkjyrarZ7RymA2WgUPD2JeBing5o20rftUn9GKt_hLw28DSAoEBppSDmovGk7AGu2Czu7-Q8HwQrqCiA2TFHuxAshnw7J78mdukHpXMaA696eQRtZs85UKc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;a title=&quot;Anaerobic bacteria&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_bacteria&quot;&gt;Anaerobic bacteria&lt;/a&gt;: They are about 3 billions years old (&lt;a href=&quot;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eniscuola.net%2Fen%2Fargomento%2Fbacteria%2Fbacteria-knowledge%2Fthe-first-organisms%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2qjxZ03C9XnofJGfELr0Eg6a1puXEK5S3jJVFtuYUk0XZ7xVNtgASILyM&amp;amp;h=AT3tA6kpMYdjBceNlN3Q1FgH6byMoWprTRaar_S9YxMEZn5iNRdA2M9ckqmyL7hDSDUZQNS2d63_xoY5YrkuuWyS8YSIwKP2fn7bYNIpgYGrjYX0M4vU6rm65stpnyR1GoPNdKtnBWIXybhNCOJg&amp;amp;__tn__=R]-R&amp;amp;c[0]=AT1nzi11rw7w19LX-9lejlRORnyxpZieAANzGcxpECtZrkjyrarZ7RymA2WgUPD2JeBing5o20rftUn9GKt_hLw28DSAoEBppSDmovGk7AGu2Czu7-Q8HwQrqCiA2TFHuxAshnw7J78mdukHpXMaA696eQRtZs85UKc&quot;&gt;لنک&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Excuses by Islam Apologists:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Islam apologists again came to defend it to. Islamweb.Net is one of the largest Islamic Fatwa website, and it presented the following excuse for this hadith (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/245617/had-it-not-been-for-bani-israel-meat-would-not-decay-&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Hadeeth is authentic; it was recorded by &lt;span style=&quot;color: maroon;&quot;&gt;Al-Bukhari&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color: maroon;&quot;&gt;Muslim&lt;/span&gt;. As regards its meaning, &lt;span style=&quot;color: maroon;&quot;&gt;An-Nawawi&lt;/span&gt; said about the interpretation of the saying of the Prophet : &lt;span style=&quot;color: 6600cc;&quot;&gt;” &lt;strong&gt;The scholars said: “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: 6600cc;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: 6600cc;&quot;&gt;It means that when Allaah sent down manna and quails to the Children of Israel, Allaah prohibited them from storing it, but they stored it; so it went bad and rotted, and this has continued since then&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you could see that Islam apologists have no other explanation other than their stubbornness, where they again claim that meat started to get spoiled only after Bani Israel stored manna and salwa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another excuse that has been presented is this (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abuaminaelias.com/meat-would-not-decay-eve-betrayed-her-husband/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar writes:&lt;br /&gt;ال وهب بن منبه فِي بَعْضِ الْكُتُبِ لَوْلَا أَنِّي كَتَبْتُ الْفَسَادَ عَلَى الطَّعَامِ لَخَزَنَهُ الْأَغْنِيَاءُ عَنِ الْفُقَرَاءِ&lt;br /&gt;Wahb ibn Munabbih said: It is written in some books that had I (Allah) not decreed that meat would spoil, the rich would have hoarded it from the poor.&lt;br /&gt;Source: Fatḥ al-Bārī 3152&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, which are these books that Muslims could not even provide their names?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, every Tom, Dick and Harry could make the similar claims that he made the meat to spoil so that rich people could not hoard it from the poor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, what that has to do with our topic? Our question is not about spoilage of meat, but it is about &quot;START&quot; of spoilage of meat only due to &quot;Bani Israel&quot;. Thus it proves that Islam apologists have no answer to this, and they are now only trying to mislead the original question. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وَحَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ رَافِعٍ، حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الرَّزَّاقِ، أَخْبَرَنَا مَعْمَرٌ، عَنْ هَمَّامِ بْنِ مُنَبِّهٍ، قَالَ هَذَا مَا حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو هُرَيْرَةَ، عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَذَكَرَ أَحَادِيثَ مِنْهَا وَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ “‏ لَوْلاَ بَنُو إِسْرَائِيلَ لَمْ يَخْبُثِ الطَّعَامُ وَلَمْ يَخْنَزِ اللَّحْمُ وَلَوْلاَ حَوَّاءُ لَمْ تَخُنْ أُنْثَى زَوْجَهَا الدَّهْرَ ‏”‏ ‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another excuse that has been presented is this (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abuaminaelias.com/meat-would-not-decay-eve-betrayed-her-husband/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar writes:&lt;br /&gt;ال وهب بن منبه فِي بَعْضِ الْكُتُبِ لَوْلَا أَنِّي كَتَبْتُ الْفَسَادَ عَلَى الطَّعَامِ لَخَزَنَهُ الْأَغْنِيَاءُ عَنِ الْفُقَرَاءِ&lt;br /&gt;Wahb ibn Munabbih said: It is written in some books that had I (Allah) not decreed that meat would spoil, the rich would have hoarded it from the poor.&lt;br /&gt;Source: Fatḥ al-Bārī 3152&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, which are these books that Muslims could not even provide their names?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, every Tom, Dick and Harry could make the similar claims that he made the meat to spoil so that rich people could not hoard it from the poor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, what that has to do with our topic? Our question is not about spoilage of meat, but it is about &quot;START&quot; of spoilage of meat only due to &quot;Bani Israel&quot;. Thus it proves that Islam apologists have no answer to this, and they are now only trying to mislead the original question. &lt;/li&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the Quran, there is a verse (Quran 2:189) where the Jews ask Muhammad about the phases of the moon and the reason behind its changing appearance. However, the Quran's response falls short of providing any scientific explanation and instead states that the phases of the moon serve as signs for people to determine dates and fix the periods for Hajj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.189&quot;&gt;2:189&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;They (the Jews) ask you about the phases of the moon. Say, &quot;These are signs for the people &lt;strong&gt;to reckon dates and fix the periods for hajj&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Qurtabi recorded the following tradition under this verse in his commentary (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=5&amp;amp;tSoraNo=2&amp;amp;tAyahNo=189&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;هذا مما سأل عنه اليهود وٱعترضوا به على النبيّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال معاذ: يا رسول الله، إن اليهود تغشانا ويكثرون مسألتنا عن الأهِلة، فما بال الهلال يبدو دقيقاً ثم يزيد حتى يستوي ويستدير، ثم ينتقص حتى يعود كما كان؟ فأنزل الله هذه الآية.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Jews asked about and objected to the Prophet. So Muadh said: O Messenger of God, the Jews come to us and ask us about the crescents, so why does the crescent appear thin, then increases until it becomes even and round, then decreases until it returns as it was? Upon that, Allah revealed this verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Readers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ponder upon it. As you can see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither there is anything scientific in this answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nor it increased anything in the knowledge of those people who asked this question, as Jews had already known that the changes in the size of the moon can be used for calculating dates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a golden chance for Allah/Muhammad to tell the real reasons behind the increasing and decreasing of the size of the moon so that modern science could have also testified the scientific miracle of the Quran. Alas, the Quran and Allah/Muhammad once again missed this chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All brainwashed Muslims, who take scientific miracles out of the Quran today, should learn their lesson from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jews had to ask this question, while the SCIENTISTS had already found the real reasons for the increasing/decreasing size of the moon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_cosmology&quot;&gt;Biblical Cosmology&lt;/a&gt;, the earth was flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of Biblical Cosmology, where the prevailing belief was in a flat Earth, the scientists' discoveries directly contradicted this notion. They had determined the true causes behind the moon's waxing and waning about 900 years before the time of Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek philosophers, as early as 500 BC, had made significant strides in understanding the shape of the Earth. Their conclusions were groundbreaking, as they established that the Earth was not flat but rather spherical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, the Jewish inquiry into the moon's phases carried even more weight. It presented an opportunity for the Quran and Muhammad to showcase advanced knowledge and scientific insight, confirming their divine origin. However, the Quran's response did not provide any new revelations or scientific truths, leading to a missed chance to demonstrate miraculous knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the Greek astronomer &lt;a title=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos&quot;&gt;Aristarchus of Samos&lt;/a&gt; in 300 BC, who was even able to calculate the sizes of the Sun and Moon, as well as their distances from the Earth (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_(Aristarchus)&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristarchus began with the premise that, during a &lt;a title=&quot;Lunar phase&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase&quot;&gt;half-moon&lt;/a&gt;, the moon forms a &lt;a title=&quot;Right triangle&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle&quot;&gt;right triangle&lt;/a&gt; with the Sun and spherical Earth.&lt;a class=&quot;image&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png&quot; alt=&quot;AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png&quot; width=&quot;484&quot; height=&quot;255&quot; data-file-width=&quot;484&quot; data-file-height=&quot;255&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristarchus then used another construction based on a lunar eclipse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;image&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AristarchusLunar_Eclipse2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/AristarchusLunar_Eclipse2.png&quot; alt=&quot;AristarchusLunar Eclipse2.png&quot; width=&quot;562&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; data-file-width=&quot;874&quot; data-file-height=&quot;263&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, there had already been a heavy debate going on between Jews and scientists about the shape of the earth before Muhammad. The Jews claimed the earth to be flat, while the scientists claimed it to be spherical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the Jews came to Muhammad and asked him about the reason for the increasing/decreasing size of the Moon, while Muhammad was claiming himself to be the continuation of the Biblical prophets. They thought, if Muhammad was really a true prophet, then he would prove those scientists to be wrong by giving them the correct answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the scientific knowledge of Muhammad/Allah was even more primitive than of Jews, as Muhammad/Allah belonged to the primitive society of Arabs of the era of ignorance. And it was reflected completely in the answer, that was given by the Quran. &lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to the Quran, the waiting period for a pregnant woman is until the birth of a child (&lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://quranx.com/65.4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quran 65:4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophet Muhammad further explained the &lt;strong&gt;scientific logic&lt;/strong&gt; behind this Quranic order, stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/Hadith/AbuDawud/DarusSalam/Hadith-2158/&quot;&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud 2158&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quotes&quot;&gt;The Messenger of Allah said: It is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and the last day &lt;b&gt;to water what another has sown with his water (meaning intercourse with a woman who is pregnant from her previous husband).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, science is clearly proving that Allah is mistaken in matters of pregnancy. If a woman has conceived from one person, then no matter how much another person engages in intercourse, it will have no effect on the child or the crop. These were the notions of the ignorant times, and Allah is also a victim of these ignorant notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, due to this divine ignorance, a helpless pregnant woman had to suffer. She was forced to suppress all her sexual desires throughout this period, while, on the other hand, a man giving a divorce was freely indulging in intimate relations with other wives and concubines right from the first night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During pregnancy, a woman undergoes significant psychological pressure, and she needs the most a companion who can comfort her with love, provide her with affection and attention, and take care of her. Allah condemned this helpless pregnant woman to the isolation and helplessness of experiencing the most challenging stage of childbirth alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In principle, a pregnant woman should not observe any waiting period of even a single day, as the child is already present in her womb, and therefore, there is no issue of the child's lineage. If a husband, after giving a divorce, can engage in intimate relations with other wives and concubines right on the first night, why can't the helpless pregnant woman marry another man, especially when there is no issue with the child's parentage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sole reason is that there is no entity named Allah, and Muhammad was making the revelation on his own in the name of Allah. Since he was only a human, he was following the ignorant notions of that time. According to which, if another man engages in intercourse with a pregnant woman, the man's fluid starts to nourish the child. Modern science has refuted all these ignorant notions. It is important to note that any potential effects of sex in the state of pregnancy on the fetus would be positive. Sex with a man makes the mother happy, resulting in a positive impact on the fetus. There is no logical reason for Allah/Muhammad to oppose such positive effects on the mother and fetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excuse Presented by Islamic Preachers::&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemporary Islamic preachers assert that Allah's wisdom is affirmed, as they claim a pregnant woman can conceive a second pregnancy from another man, a phenomenon termed  &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/superfetation?fbclid=IwAR0sbhq6yrqqKzbmmc6nXbhHU8LE7ZwkJ5-nU_qdEPbpYQHR7PtQ8-XclvQ&quot;&gt;Superfetation&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superfetation, if it occurs at all among humans, is an extremely rare exception. However, laws are established for the general populace and not for extraordinary instances. In the entire medical history, only ten recorded cases of superfetation exist worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, these cases are met with skepticism in the scientific community, as they may be instances of twins (&lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.duke.edu/news/so-about-woman-who-got-pregnant-twice-ten-days&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, most cases occurred in women undergoing fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization (IVF).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, it's crucial to note that superfetation can only occur within a 10-day to three-week timeframe (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellfamily.com/superfetation-2447183#:~:text=Risks%20of%20Superfetation,-If%20the%20two&amp;amp;text=As%20there%20is%20a%20higher,cases%20were%20usually%20safely%20delivered.&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, even if laws were based on superfetation, the 'Iddah (waiting period) of a pregnant woman would be at most three to four weeks. However, Muhammad mandated the 'iddah for pregnant women until the 9th month (i.e., until delivery). Consequently, Islamic apologists cannot justify the Islamic 'Iddah by invoking superfetation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary Islamic preachers assert that Allah's wisdom is affirmed, as they claim a pregnant woman can conceive a second pregnancy from another man, a phenomenon termed  &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/superfetation?fbclid=IwAR0sbhq6yrqqKzbmmc6nXbhHU8LE7ZwkJ5-nU_qdEPbpYQHR7PtQ8-XclvQ&quot;&gt;Superfetation&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Superfetation, if it occurs at all among humans, is an extremely rare exception. However, laws are established for the general populace and not for extraordinary instances. In the entire medical history, only ten recorded cases of superfetation exist worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, these cases are met with skepticism in the scientific community, as they may be instances of twins (&lt;a href=&quot;https://obgyn.duke.edu/news/so-about-woman-who-got-pregnant-twice-ten-days&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, most cases occurred in women undergoing fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization (IVF).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, it's crucial to note that superfetation can only occur within a 10-day to three-week timeframe (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellfamily.com/superfetation-2447183#:~:text=Risks%20of%20Superfetation,-If%20the%20two&amp;amp;text=As%20there%20is%20a%20higher,cases%20were%20usually%20safely%20delivered.&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, even if laws were based on superfetation, the 'Iddah (waiting period) of a pregnant woman would be at most three to four weeks. However, Muhammad mandated the 'iddah for pregnant women until the 9th month (i.e., until delivery). Consequently, Islamic apologists cannot justify the Islamic 'Iddah by invoking superfetation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

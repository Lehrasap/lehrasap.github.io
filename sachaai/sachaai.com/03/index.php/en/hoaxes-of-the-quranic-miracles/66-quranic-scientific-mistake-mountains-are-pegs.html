<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId9525"></a>The concept of mountains as pegs existed before Muhammad</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Other civilizations also had this concept, where mountains are described as pegs or similar structures. For instance, this idea is found in the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(Bible: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah%202%3A6&amp;version=NIV">John 2:6</a>):<br><strong>To the roots of the mountains,</strong> I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you, LORD my God, brought my life up from the pit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quran also introduces two scientific mistakes:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>However, modern science reveals that mountains are not "placed" or "cast" onto the earth's surface. Mountains form through tectonic plate collisions. When two plates collide, one part of the crust rises to form a mountain, while the other part moves downward.</p>
<p>This process of tectonic collisions, occurring over millions of years, causes mountains to rise incrementally. Eventually, when tectonic plates begin to move apart, the mountains start to erode and, over millions of years, disappear entirely.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>Mount Everest</strong> did not exist 250 million years ago. Over time, as tectonic plates collided, Everest began to rise. Today, it's the tallest mountain in the world and continues to grow. However, there will come a time when Everest will begin to erode and ultimately vanish.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Quran makes another reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(Quran <a href="https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/16/15/default.htm">16:15</a>) <br>وألقى في الأرض رواسي أن تميد بكم <br>And He has <strong>cast</strong> into the earth firmly set mountains, lest it shift with you  (Translation by Sahih International)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word "cast" is derived from <strong>alqa</strong> (lam-qaf-ya), which in Arabic verb form IV frequently means "throw" or "cast." This word is used similarly in the Quran:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quran 3:44</strong> (when lots are cast using pens).</li>
<li><strong>Quran 12:10</strong> (when the Prophet Yusuf is cast into a well).</li>
<li><strong>Quran 20:20</strong> (when Moses casts down his staff, which turns into a snake).</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of "cast" suggests a misunderstanding of how mountains are formed, as though they were scattered like objects, which contradicts modern geological understanding.</p>
<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId940445"></a><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Second Scientific Mistake in the Quran</strong>: The claim that Allah created mountains on the <strong>second day</strong> of the creation of the heavens and the earth</h2>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quran claims that Allah had already created the mountains on the 2nd day of creation. </p>
<blockquote class="_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL">
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(Quran 41:9-11)<br>Say, "Do you indeed disbelieve in He who <strong>created the earth in two days</strong> and attribute to Him equals?

They said, "We have come willingly."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And Hadith made it clearer that 2nd day of creation was Sunday when the mountains were created by Allah. </p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scientific Rebuttal:</span></strong></p>
<p>Islam's claim that mountains were created on the second day of the creation of the heavens and the earth is scientifically inaccurate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Earth formed approximately 9 billion years</strong> after the universe (heavens) came into existence.</li>
<li>Initially, Earth was composed of gases and had a molten surface. It took <strong>billions of years</strong> to cool and solidify into a solid form.</li>
<li>Even after the Earth became solid, it took additional <strong>billions of years</strong> for tectonic plates to form, which then led to the creation of mountains through tectonic activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, mountains constantly change. Old mountains erode and disappear, while new ones continue to form through the ongoing process of tectonic plate movement.</p>
<p>Muhammad, unaware of these scientific facts, claimed that mountains were placed on the second day of creation, which contradicts modern geological knowledge.</p>
<h2 class="_1WODZhR-x-fbMu3MOL9cH1"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId877572"></a>Other Types of Mountains Without Roots in the Earth</h2>
<div class="_1WODZhR-x-fbMu3MOL9cH1">
<p>While one type of mountain forms due to the collision of tectonic plates, other types, such as <strong>volcanic mountains</strong>, are formed when <strong>lava</strong> erupts from inside the Earth. As this lava cools, it creates large mountains. These <strong>lava mountains</strong> have no deep roots in the Earth that could be considered pegs.</p>
<p>Questions to Consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad explain that mountains form when tectonic plates collide?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad describe that mountains start small and rise over time due to earthquakes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad mention that mountains eventually erode and disappear?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad state that there was initially one large continent (Pangaea), which later split into seven continents due to tectonic plate movement?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the writer of the Quran or Muhammad explain that earthquakes are caused by the collision of tectonic plates?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No, instead, the writer of the Quran/Muhammad claimed that <strong>Allah sends earthquakes as a punishment</strong> for disobedience.</p>
<p>The Quran fails to address any of these scientifically supported facts but instead focuses on one assertion: that mountains act as pegs. This belief was already common among the pagans of the time due to the visible appearance of mountains. Yet, some Muslims today claim it as an undeniable miracle of the Quran.</p>

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId186021"></a>Excuses by Muslim apologists:</h2>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId280315"></a>Excuse: The Quran is a Book of Guidance, Not Science</h3>
<p>Muslim apologists often argue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Allah has mentioned no science in the Quran. Therefore, it cannot be judged in light of modern science. The Quran is a book of guidance, not a book of science."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response</strong></span>:</p>
<p>When the writer of the Quran (i.e., Muhammad) begins to describe <strong>the story of creation</strong>, he inevitably enters the realm of science. By doing so, these descriptions must be evaluated in light of the <strong>scientific facts</strong> that modern science has discovered.</p>
<p>If the Quran makes claims about natural phenomena or the process of creation, it opens itself up to scrutiny based on scientific knowledge. Therefore, while it may be primarily a book of guidance, any <strong>scientific assertions</strong> made within it should still be judged against the established facts discovered through modern science.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId676261"></a>Excuse: The Quran could not be judged in light of science while science is 'UNRELIABLE'</h3>
<p>Muslim apologist writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Science isn't an accurate measure of the validity of the Qur'an since it's always changing and is not always absolute truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response</strong></span>:</p>
<p>It's important to differentiate between <strong>scientific hypotheses</strong> and <strong>scientific facts</strong>. Hypotheses may evolve as new evidence emerges, but once something becomes a <strong>scientific fact</strong>, it is unlikely to change. For example, the fact that the Earth is spherical is a <strong>scientific fact</strong> that will not be overturned. Even if the Quran repeatedly states that the Earth is flat, it cannot stand against this established fact.</p>
<p>Similarly, the formation of mountains due to the <strong>collision of tectonic plates</strong> has reached the stage of being a <strong>scientific fact</strong> and will not change. So, even if the Quran states many times that Allah placed mountains from above, it cannot stand against this established scientific fact.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId820809"></a>Excuse: Non-Muslims Provide False Translations</h3>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A Muslim apologist argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"> Non-Muslims often choose one translation out of many, which can lead to misunderstandings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The issue is not about choosing one translation over many, but about providing the <strong>correct</strong> translation. It is well-known that some Muslim translators distort the meaning to protect the Quran from criticism or align it with modern scientific views. Many translations reflect the translator's personal opinions rather than the original meaning.</p>
<p>We have provided <strong>word-for-word translations</strong> directly from Muslim sources, leaving no room for misinterpretation. If Muslim apologists claim these translations are incorrect, they are welcome to refute them with proof. Simply blaming non-Muslims for inaccurate translations, without providing evidence, is not a valid argument.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not just a matter of "one" translation, as claimed. Here are translations from <strong>multiple Muslim scholars</strong> for <strong>Quran 41:10</strong>:</p>

<h2 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId700921"></a>Questions That Arise in a Neutral Mind About the Quranic Story of the Creation of Mountains</h2>
<p>While Muslim apologists are often unwavering in their beliefs—so much so that even if Muhammad himself appeared and admitted to fabricating the Quran, they might still not accept it.</p>
<p>However, a neutral, open-minded reader of the Quranic stories is likely to have several important questions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Question: Why Discuss the Creation of Mountains?</strong></span></p>
<p>Muslim apologists argue that when the Quran says mountains were "placed or cast from above," it's because the people of that time didn't understand complex scientific concepts like <strong>plate tectonics</strong>. But this leads to a basic question:</p>
<p>If the people of that time couldn't grasp the real scientific processes behind mountain formation, then <strong>what was the point of telling them this story</strong>?</p>
<p>Why would Allah include a description of mountain creation that could confuse them, especially when He skipped explaining the creation of things like deserts, rivers, and oceans? It seems unnecessary to introduce a concept that wasn’t relevant to their understanding.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Second Question: Could the Story Have Been Told More Clearly?</strong></span></p>
<p>There were <strong>better ways</strong> the Quran could have communicated this idea without conflicting with modern science. For instance, the Quran could have simply said:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Mountains were formed by Allah to stabilize the earth."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This statement removes the problematic imagery of mountains being placed from above while still delivering the intended message.</p>
<p>Another alternative might have been:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Allah caused the mountains to rise from the earth, stabilizing it."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, the Quran could have <strong>avoided</strong> the topic altogether, as it did with other natural formations like deserts and rivers.</p>
<p>These options would have made the message more accessible to people of <strong>all times</strong>, without contradicting scientific facts. It would be difficult for Muslim apologists to argue that these versions are not clearer or more accurate than the ones found in the Quran.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Third Question: What Would a False Prophet Say?</strong></span></p>
<p>A neutral thinker might also consider this: <strong>If Muhammad were a false prophet</strong>, making up these revelations, would his version of the story have been any different?</p>
<p>Probably not. A false prophet, trying to show the <strong>power of Allah</strong>, would likely come up with the exact kind of statements we find in the Quran—grand claims like Allah "placing or casting" mountains onto the earth.</p>
<p>This kind of language would have impressed his audience at the time, but now, we know it <strong>contradicts</strong> the scientific explanation of how mountains form through <strong>tectonic plate movement</strong> over millions of years.</p>
<p>These questions point out significant inconsistencies and missed opportunities in the Quranic story of mountain creation. The story could have been told in a much clearer and more scientifically sound way, without losing its message. Instead, what we find is a description that feels more like an attempt to showcase divine power, but one that ultimately clashes with established scientific facts. This suggests that the verses may have been crafted to impress, rather than to convey timeless truth.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Quranic Claim That Its Verses Are Clear and Easy to Understand Becomes False</h3>
<p>The Quran makes several claims about its clarity and accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its verses are <em>"easy to understand"</em> (Quran 54:17).</li>
<li>Its verses are <em>"clear,"</em> <em>"manifest,"</em> and meant for <em>"guidance"</em> (Quran 27:1-2).</li>
<li>It was revealed in the Arabic language so that people could comprehend it (Quran 12:2).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these claims become questionable when we encounter verses that contradict <strong>scientific facts</strong>. These verses are often <strong>vague</strong>, leading to <strong>contradictions</strong> not only between science and scripture but also among Muslims themselves. Many Muslims interpret these verses differently, and none seem to reach a consensus on their true meaning.</p>
<p>Muslim apologists often introduce <strong>confusing explanations</strong> to justify these contradictions. Ironically, this very confusion serves as evidence that the Quran’s verses are neither as clear nor as understandable as claimed. If the Quran were truly easy to understand, there wouldn't be such widespread disagreement or the need for complicated interpretations.</p>
<h3 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId177493"></a>Apologist Argument: Divine Days vs. Earthly Days</h3>
<p>Muslim apologists often argue that the days of creation described in the Quran are not equivalent to Earthly days. They claim these "days" were unspecified periods of time beyond human comprehension. Therefore, they argue that the six days mentioned in the Quran should not be taken literally.</p>
<h4>Key Questions for a Neutral Observer:</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1. Why Specify the Duration if It’s Unfathomable?</strong></span></p>
<p>If these divine days are beyond human understanding, what was the purpose of specifying that creation occurred over six days? If the length of these days is inconceivable, why not simply describe the creation without referring to a specific time frame? This would avoid confusion and prevent misinterpretation of the time span involved.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Can Humans Understand Long Periods?</strong></span></p>
<p>Modern science indicates that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The universe is about <strong>13.8 billion years old</strong>.</li>
<li>Earth formed around <strong>4.5 billion years ago</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans are capable of grasping such extensive periods. If the Quran intended to convey a long creation period, it could have provided an accurate description that aligns with scientific understanding, making it accessible and comprehensible.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Is the Concept of 'Unspecified Time' Valid?</strong></span></p>
<p>The argument that divine days are unspecified is challenged by verses that quantify time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quran 22:47</strong>: <em>"A Day with your Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning."</em></li>
<li><strong>Quran 32:5</strong>: <em>"He rules all affairs from the heavens to the earth, and then they ascend to Him on a Day the length of which is a thousand years of your reckoning."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These verses suggest that one divine day equals a thousand Earth years. This interpretation has led some to believe that each creation day lasted a thousand years. However, even this interpretation falls short. Six divine days equate to only <strong>6,000 years</strong>, which still does not align with the billions of years required by modern scientific evidence for the universe's creation.</p>
<p>Thus Sahaba (i.e. companions) believed in it that one day of creation was equal to 1000 years of our reckoning.</p>
<p>Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of this verse (<a href="https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;tSoraNo=22&amp;tAyahNo=47&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="TextResultArabic"> </span>قال ابن أبي حاتم حدثنا الحسن بن عرفة، حدثني عبدة بن سليمان عن محمد بن عمرو عن أبي سلمة عن أبي هريرة أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال " يدخل فقراء المسلمين الجنة قبل الأغنياء بنصف يوم خمسمائة عام " ورواه الترمذي والنسائي من حديث الثوري عن محمد بن عمرو به، وقال الترمذي حسن صحيح. وقد رواه ابن جرير عن أبي هريرة موقوفاً، فقال حدثني يعقوب، حدثنا ابن علية، حدثنا سعيد الجريري عن أبي نضرة عن سمير بن نهار قال قال أبو هريرة يدخل فقراء المسلمين الجنة قبل الأغنياء بمقدار نصف يوم، قلت وما مقدار نصف يوم؟ قال أو ما تقرأ القرآن؟ قلت بلى، قال { وَإِنَّ يَوْماً عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ }. وقال أبو داود في آخر كتاب الملاحم من سننه حدثنا عمرو بن عثمان، حدثنا أبو المغيرة، حدثنا صفوان عن شريح بن عبيد عن سعد بن أبي وقاص عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه قال " إني لأرجو أن لا تعجز أمتي عند ربها أن يؤخرهم نصف يوم " قيل لسعد وما نصف يوم؟ قال خمسمائة سنة. وقال ابن أبي حاتم حدثنا أحمد بن سنان، حدثنا عبد الرحمن بن مهدي عن إسرائيل عن سماك، عن عكرمة عن ابن عباس { وَإِنَّ يَوْماً عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ } قال من الأيام التي خلق الله فيها السموات والأرض. ورواه ابن جرير عن ابن بشار عن ابن المهدي، وبه قال مجاهد وعكرمة، ونص عليه أحمد بن حنبل في كتاب الرد على الجهمية، وقال مجاهد هذه الآية كقوله{ يُدَبِّرُ ٱلاَْمْرَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ إِلَى ٱلاَْرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ فِى يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ } السجدة 5.<br><br></p>
<p>Rasool Allah told that the poor people will enter paradise <strong>half a day</strong> before the rich people, which means<strong> 500 years before the rich people (while whole day is equal to 1000 years of people's reckoning)</strong>. al-Tirmidhi and al-Nisai etc recorded it and al-Tirmidhi said that this tradition is<strong> 'Hasan Sahih' (i.e. authentic according to al-Tirmidhi)</strong>. In another tradition, it was asked from Abu Hurayrah, how long is this half day? He replied: "Didn't you read the Quran?" I said: "Yes." <strong>Upon that he recited verse 22:47</strong> ... Companion S'ad was asked: "How long is this half day." He replied: <strong>"500 years"</strong>. Ibn Abbas recited this verse and said that <strong>this is the length of those 6 days, in which Allah created the heavens and the earth</strong> (Ibn Jarir). While Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal described it in clearer words in his book "Refutation of al-Jahmia". Mujjahid said that this verse is similar to verse 5 of Surah al-Sajdah [(Quran 32:5) He rules (all) affairs from the heavens to the earth: in the end will (all affairs) go up to Him, on a Day, <strong>the space whereof will be (as) a thousand years of your reckoning</strong>.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the explanation that divine days differ from Earthly days does not fully resolve the issue. If the Quran intended to describe a timeframe that humans could understand, it could have done so in a way consistent with modern science. Instead, the Quran's references to specific time spans create inconsistencies with established scientific knowledge, leaving apologists with a challenging task of reconciling these differences.</p>
<h4>Historical and Cultural Context (An Answer by Chat GPT)</h4>
<p>Similar concepts can be found in other ancient civilizations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Biblical References:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Bible</strong>, particularly in Psalms and Job, mountains are sometimes described as foundational or stabilizing elements. For example, <strong>Job 28:9</strong> describes mining through mountains, reflecting their perceived stability and immovability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ancient Greek Beliefs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient Greeks, influenced by early philosophers and poets, often saw mountains as the pillars or supports of the Earth. For instance, Homer’s epics sometimes depict mountains as crucial, supportive features of the terrestrial world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ancient Hindu Texts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hindu cosmology also contains references to mountains playing significant roles in the structure of the world. For example, Mount Meru is often depicted as the central axis of the universe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p>The Quran's depiction of mountains as "pegs" or stabilizers is not unique and reflects a common ancient understanding of mountains as stabilizing features of the Earth. This interpretation is consistent with similar descriptions found in various ancient cultures, where mountains were often seen as crucial, immovable parts of the world. However, this ancient perspective does not align with modern geological science, which provides a more complex and dynamic explanation of mountain formation and tectonics.</p>
<p>The claim of a Quranic miracle based on this description overlooks the fact that many ancient civilizations shared similar views. These interpretations, while historically interesting, do not necessarily provide evidence of advanced scientific knowledge in the Quran beyond what was common in the ancient world.</p>     </div>

&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers claim the following about the war rulings in Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/Muhammads_actual_commands_in_wars.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;495&quot; height=&quot;887&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these are lies, and the reality of Islam is totally opposite to this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId481529&quot;&gt;The killing of PRISONERS (those who surrendered)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId714366&quot;&gt;Muhammad also ordered the killing of old captives and young boys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId920858&quot;&gt;Yes, Muhammad ordered the looting of captive women, and to make them slaves and compel them to provide sex services for their entire lives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId520834&quot;&gt;Even Children were made SLAVES for the whole of their lives (including their coming Offspring i.e. the Evil of Slavery by Birth)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId490870&quot;&gt;Raping 9 years old (or even younger) pre-pubescent captive girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId6828&quot;&gt;Killing Children during the raids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId907299&quot;&gt;All the non-Muslims could be attacked, while all the graze lands belong to Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId552910&quot;&gt;“Invitation to Islam” is not needed before attacking and killing the non-Muslims:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId496684&quot;&gt;Either accept Islam, or you will be beheaded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId82845&quot;&gt;Jizya was enforced only in order to humiliate Jews &amp;amp; Christians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId671002&quot;&gt;Destroying Temple, and killing the priests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId662607&quot;&gt;Mutilation of the Dead Bodies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId262576&quot;&gt;The killing of a Woman (Umm Qirfa)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId179051&quot;&gt;Cutting and burning of the Trees of opponents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId385962&quot;&gt;109 Verses of the Quran to fight the non-believers, and 164 verses about Jihad&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/#mozTocId393478&quot;&gt;(2) Quran has total of164 Jihad Verses:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId481529&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The killing of PRISONERS (those who surrendered)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The killing of prisoners is not only a “war crime” today, but even the Arabs of time of ignorance hated this act. But Muhammad's morals were even worse than the Arabs of the time of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers today do false propaganda that killing prisoners (who surrendered) is not allowed. But this is a lie, as Muhammad himself killed 800 men of Banu Qurayzah, who surrendered and accepted to become prisoners of Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not an exceptional case, but the Quran is itself a witness that the slaughter of prisoners is necessary upon the prophet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;(Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/8.67&quot;&gt;8:67&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;It is not fit for any prophet to have captives until he has made slaughter of them in the land&lt;/strong&gt;. You desire the frail goods of this world, while Allah desires (for you) the hereafter&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter: What Has Been Related About Killing Captives And Ransoming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;Narrated 'Imran bin Husain: ... &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;It is for the Imam to decide to be generous with whom he wills among the captives, &lt;strong&gt;or to kill whom he wills among them&lt;/strong&gt;, or to ransom whom he wills among them.&lt;strong&gt; Some of the people of knowledge preferred killing over ransoming&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Awzai' said: &quot;It has been conveyed to me. that this Ayah of ranson (47:4) is abrogated ... It was abrogated by: Kill them wherever you find them (2:191). This was narrated to us by Hannad (who said): &quot;Ibn Al-Mubarak narrated to us, from Al-Awza'i.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishaq bin Mansur said: &quot;I said to Ahmad: 'When the captives are captured' is killing or ransoming better to you?' He said: 'If they are able to ransom (by paying huge amount of money) then there is no harm in it. And if they (are) killed, then I do not know of any harm in it.'&quot; Ishaq said: &quot;Wiping them out is better to me, unless it is someone well-known, so that it is hoped that a large amount (of ransom money) will be obtained for him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Darussalam)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId714366&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad also ordered the killing of old captives and young boys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic preachers claim that Islam forbids killing old men,  women and children. But this is not true regarding the old men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Old men were not useful as slaves (to do work). Thus, Muhammad ordered the killing of the old captives and to not let them live as slaves, while they were useless as servants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;عَنْ سَمُرَةَ بْنِ جُنْدَبٍ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ &quot;‏ اقْتُلُوا شُيُوخَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ وَاسْتَحْيُوا شَرْخَهُمْ ‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏ وَالشَّرْخُ الْغِلْمَانُ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُنْبِتُوا ‏.‏ قَالَ أَبُو عِيسَى هَذَا حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ صَحِيحٌ غَرِيبٌ ‏.‏ وَرَوَاهُ الْحَجَّاجُ بْنُ أَرْطَاةَ عَنْ قَتَادَةَ نَحْوَهُ ‏.‏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Narrated Samurah bin Jundab: That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Kill the elder men among the idolaters and spare the Sharkh (young male children under the age of 12) amont them.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And the Sharkh are the boys who did not begin to grow pubic hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;[Abu 'Eisa (i.e. Imam Tirmidhi) said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Hajjaj bin Artah narrated similarly from Qatadah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This same Hadith has also been recorded by Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, from another chain of narration, with his comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&amp;amp;ID=19288&amp;amp;flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal, Hadith 19632&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;حدثنا أبو معاوية حدثنا الحجاج عن قتادة عن الحسن عن سمرة بن جندب قال قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم اقتلوا شيوخ المشركين واستحيوا شرخهم قال عبد الله سألت أبي عن تفسير هذا [ ص: 13 ] الحديث اقتلوا شيوخ المشركين قال يقول الشيخ لا يكاد أن يسلم والشاب أي يسلم كأنه أقرب إلى الإسلام من الشيخ قال الشرخ الشباب&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Samurah said that Prophet said: Kill the &lt;strong&gt;elder men&lt;/strong&gt; of Mushrikeen, and spare the Sharkh (boys under the age of 12). The son of Imam Ahmed asked his father about this Hadith, and he further cleared that an elder old man does not normally accept Islam, while the chances of young person accepting Islam is much more than an old man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad killed all the old men in the incident of Banu Qurayzah, but spared the young boys (under the age of 12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad killed all the boys, who were 12 years old (and had pubic hair).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/nasai:3429&quot;&gt;Sunan Nasai, 3429&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; ​​It was narrated that Kathir bin As-Sa'ib said: &quot;The sons of Quraizah told me that they were presented to the Messenger of Allah on the Day of Quraizah, and whoever (among them) had reached puberty, or had grown pubic hair, was killed, and whoever had not reached puberty and had not grown pubic hair was left (alive).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Grade: Sahih (Darussalam)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId920858&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Muhammad ordered the looting of captive women, and to make them slaves and compel them to provide sex services for their entire lives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women were innocent. They had no part in the decisions of wars. They neither participated in the wars nor killed any Muslims. But despite this, Muhammad ordered the looting of captive women and then made them slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Muhammad also allowed raping the captive women in a Shia Mutta-type “&lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual Relationship”. This means that after fulfilling the lust, a master handed her over to his brother or any slave. And when all brothers and slaves also raped her one by one, then she was sold to another master, who again raped her, and then sold to the 3rd master .... and this chain of rape of slave women in temporary sexual relationships continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Kitab-ul-Nikah (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20140719221709/http://sunnah.com/muslim/16/147&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), Sahih Bukhari, Kitab-ul-Qadr (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;http://sunnah.com/bukhari/82/9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;amp; Sahih Bukhari, Kitab-ul-Tauheed (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;http://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/38&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;0 Abu Sa'id al-Khadri said: We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired (to have sex with) them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;we also desired good ransom money for them by selling them)&lt;/strong&gt;. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing 'azl (i.e. withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception so that they don’t become pregnant). But then we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: (Yes, it is allowed, but) it does not matter if you do it or not, while if any soul has to be born up to the Day of Resurrection, then it will be born.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halal International Slave Trading&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving freedom to poor women captives, and letting them go to their relatives, Muhammad made it Halal to use them even for international slave trading. Muhammad sold the Jewish captive women of Banu Qurayzah (who believed in a God) to Kuffar (who were polytheists). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?id=pbrjCQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA22&amp;amp;lpg=PA22&amp;amp;dq=qurayzah+hassan&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=nJhrvGA_Zr&amp;amp;sig=2e6vxMmSwlHttJf5eW7S9kAt_Go&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCGoVChMI5c2tzJ_uxwIVCHAaCh1I5gzO#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=qurayzah%20Najd&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;History of Tabari, vol. 8, page 39&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the apostle sent Sa`d b. Zayd al-Ansari brother of b. `Abdu’l-Ashhal with some of the captive women of B. Qurayza to Najd and he sold them for horses and weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Islamic countries became some of the biggest hubs of international slave trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId520834&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Even Children were made SLAVES for the whole of their lives (including their coming Offspring i.e. the Evil of Slavery by Birth)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Children were also made slaves for the whole of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Young and small girls and boys (under the age of 12)  had no role in the wars against Muslims, but still, they were also made slaves for their entire lives and were compelled to serve their Muslim masters for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Even worse, the coming generations of these slave children were also born automatically as slaves too. It was due to the EVIL of “&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Slavery by Birth&lt;/strong&gt;” in Muhammad's Islam. Please read more about this “Slavery by Birth” in Islam in our article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=76&amp;amp;catid=17&quot;&gt;Part1: Crimes against Humanity of Islamic Slavery.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/e847ae4604f179224a290a46771103f2&quot;&gt;Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22967&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.&lt;br&gt;As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine the trauma of these small pre-pubescent girls? Their fathers and brothers were killed during the daytime, and Muslim Jihadists were raping them the same night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me at a place called Al-Abwa or Waddan, and was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1745b&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim 1745b&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is narrated by Sa'b b. Jaththama that he said (to the Holy Prophet): Messenger of Allah, we kill the children of the polytheists during the night raids. He said: &lt;strong&gt;They are from them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words of Muhammad (i.e.  &lt;strong&gt;They are from them&lt;/strong&gt;) are extremely problematic. With these words, he is encouraging his companions to become &lt;strong&gt;merciless &lt;/strong&gt;against children and women during attacks, as there is no problem killing them as they also belong to pagan Kafirs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateral damage is something else. For that, Muhammad had to tell his companions to avoid killing children and women as much as possible if they were not armed against them and attacking them. However, with the usage of the words {&lt;strong&gt;They are from them&lt;/strong&gt; i.e. the pagan Kuffar} he incited hatred in his companions against children and women too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US took thousands of times more precautions than Muhammad, in order to avoid the killing of innocent children and women while bombing the terrorists of al-Qaeda and Taliban and ISIS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId552910&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Invitation to Islam” is not needed before attacking and killing the non-Muslims:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/32/1?fbclid=IwAR0Vw3NsIRBEoZCOK33cKBACySzyRGACHyVvjPmWAPMVE2Rugiyh_jsLlhs&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith 1730a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Ibn 'Aun reported: I wrote to Nafi' inquiring from him whether it was necessary to extend (to the disbelievers) an invitation to accept (Islam) before meeting them in fight. He wrote (in reply) to me that &lt;strong&gt;it was necessary (only) in the early days of Islam.&lt;/strong&gt; The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at the water. He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Why this ruling of invitation to Islam and the last chance to save themselves was abrogated? The answer is, only for the greed of more looting and more women and more graze-lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3012:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Narrated As-Sab bin Jaththama: The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me at a place called Al-Abwa or Waddan, and was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, &quot;They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans).&quot; Prophet said: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the graze-lands belong to Allah and his prophet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId496684&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Either accept Islam, or you will be beheaded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that JIZYA was allowed only for the 'people of the book' (i.e. Christians, Jews, Magians). As far as polytheists and all other religions were concerned, there was no JIZYA for them, but they had to accept either Islam or be killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam Q&amp;amp;A is the largest Muslim Fatwa Website, which is run by Saudi Salafi Scholars. It writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34770/there-is-no-compulsion-to-accept-islam&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The kuffaar (i.e. polytheists) should be compelled to enter Islam&lt;/strong&gt; if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken (i.e. from the people of book), because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood.&lt;strong&gt; Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allaah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential,&lt;/strong&gt; because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued. &lt;br&gt;Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, &lt;strong&gt;because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why ISIS took Jizya from Christians in Iraq but didn't accept the Jizya from “Yazidis”. Following Muhammad, ISIS slaughtered all the Yazidi men and took all their women as slaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/urn/178860&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4557&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira: The Verse:--&quot;You (true Muslims) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind.&quot; means, the best of peoples for the people, as you bring them with chains on their necks &lt;strong&gt;till they embrace Islam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId82845&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jizya was enforced only in order to humiliate Jews &amp;amp; Christians&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagans were compelled directly to accept Islam under the threat of beheading them otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jews &amp;amp; Christians were also compelled Indirectly to accept Islam by humiliating them through Jizya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran is clear about this humiliation through Jizyah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 9:28-29) يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْمُشْرِكُونَ &lt;strong&gt;نَجَسٌ &lt;/strong&gt;فَلاَ يَقْرَبُواْ الْمَسْجِدَ الْحَرَامَ بَعْدَ عَامِهِمْ هَـذَا وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ عَيْلَةً فَسَوْفَ يُغْنِيكُمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِن شَآءَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ - قَـتِلُواْ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَلاَ بِالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَلاَ يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَلاَ يَدِينُونَ دِينَ الْحَقِّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ حَتَّى يُعْطُواْ الْجِزْيَةَ عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ &lt;strong&gt;صَـغِرُونَ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=9&amp;amp;vid=29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;online link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are &lt;strong&gt;unclean (/impure/filthy)&lt;/strong&gt;; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque ... Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, of the People of the Book (i.e. Christians and Jews and Zoroastrians), until they pay the Jizya (tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;humiliated (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arabic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: صَـغِرُونَ)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here صَـغِرُونَ is an Arabic word, which means humiliation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=9&amp;amp;vid=29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). This same word has also been used in Quran in verse (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=7&amp;amp;vid=119&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;7:119&lt;/a&gt;) and verse (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=7&amp;amp;vid=13&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;7:113&lt;/a&gt;) with the same meaning of “Humiliation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir wrote in the commentary of this verse 9:29 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180603162803/http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=2566&amp;amp;Itemid=64&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;(and feel themselves subdued.), disgraced, humiliated and belittled&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, Muslims are not allowed to honor the people of Dhimmah or elevate them above Muslims, for they are miserable, disgraced and humiliated. Muslim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, لَا تَبْدَءُوا الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَارَى بِالسَّلَامِ، وَإِذَا لَقِيتُمْ أَحَدَهُمْ فِي طَرِيقٍ فَاضْطَرُّوهُ إِلَى أَضْيَقِه (Do not initiate the Salam to the Jews and Christians, and if you meet any of them in a road, force them to its narrowest alley).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jizya has nothing to do with the exemption of Jihad (as Islam apologists claim). Muslims went for Jihad, and they got a share of the war Booty as a reward, while non-Muslims didn't get any war booty. &lt;/strong&gt;If any Muslim does not go for Jihad, he will not get a share of war booty, but at least he does not have to pay Jizyah. But Jews &amp;amp; Christians will not get a share from war booty, and as well as they have to pay the Jizya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4355&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4355:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Narrated Jarir: In the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance there was a house called Dhu-l-Khalasa or Al-Ka`ba Al- Yamaniya or Al-Ka`ba Ash-Shamiya. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, &quot;Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l- Khalasa?&quot; So I set out with one-hundred-and-fifty riders,&lt;strong&gt; and we dismantled it and killed whoever was present there&lt;/strong&gt;. Then I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and informed him, and he invoked good upon us and Al- Ahmas (tribe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4357&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4357&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Dhul-l--Khulasa was a house in Yemen belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka`ba.&quot; &lt;strong&gt;Jarir went there, burnt it with fire and dismantled it&lt;/strong&gt;. When Jarir reached Yemen, there was a man who used to foretell and give good omens by casting arrows of divination. Someone said to him. &quot;The messenger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is present here and if he should get hold of you, he would chop off your neck.&quot; One day while he was using them (i.e. arrows of divination), Jarir stopped there and said to him,&lt;strong&gt; &quot;Break them (i.e. the arrows) and testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, or else I will chop off your neck.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; So the man broke those arrows and testified that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long Islam apologists are going to hide this real face of Islam? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;No woman of Banu Qurayzah was killed except one. She was with me, talking and laughing on her back and belly (extremely), while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was killing her people with the swords. Suddenly a man called her name: Where is so-and-so? She said: I I asked: What is the matter with you? She said: I did a new act. She said: The man took her and beheaded her. She said: I will not forget that she was laughing extremely although she knew that she would be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zayd also raided Wadi-l-Qurra where he met Banu Fazara and some of his companions were killed; he himself carried wounded from the field. Ward b. Amr b. Madash one of B. Sad b. Hudhayl was killed by one of B. Badr whose name Sa’d b. Hudhaym. When Zayd came he swore that he would use no ablution until he raided B. Fazara; and when he recovered from his wounds the apostle sent him against them with a force. He fought them in Wadi-al-Qura and killed some of them. Qays b. al-Musahhar al-Yamuri killed Mas’ada b. Hakama b. Malik b. Hudhayfa b. Badr and Umm Qirfa Fatima was taken prisoner. She was a very old woman, wife of Malik. Her daughter and Abdulla b. Mas’ada were also taken. &lt;b&gt;Zaid ordered Qays b al-Musahhar to kill Umm Qirfa and he killed her cruelly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Allah’s Messenger sent Zayd to Wadi Qura, where he encountered the Banu Fazarah. Some of his Companions were killed, and Zayd was carried away wounded. Ward was slain by the Banu Badr. When Zayd returned, he vowed that no washing should touch his head until he had raided the Fazarah. After he recovered, Muhammad sent him with an army against the Fazarah settlement. He met them in Qura and inflicted casualties on them and took Umm Qirfah prisoner. He also took one of Umm’s daughters and Abdallah bin Mas’adah prisoner. &lt;b&gt;Zyad bin Harithah ordered Qays to kill Umm, and he killed her cruelly. He tied each of her legs with a rope and tied the ropes to two camels, and they split her in two.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter: Permissibility of cutting down the trees of the Kuffar and burning them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) caused the date-palms of Banu Nadir to be cut down and burnt. ... in the same connection was revealed the Qur'anic verse:&quot; Whatever trees you have cut down or left standing on their trunks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, Muhammad brought 100% destruction upon his opponents. He slaughtered men or made them slaves. He took all women as slaves and let his companions rape them. He also made all small children slaves for their entire lives (although they were innocent and had no role in wars). And the later generations of those slave children were also automatically born as slaves due to the evil of Slavery By Birth in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The killing of prisoners is not only a “war crime” today, but even the Arabs of time of ignorance hated this act. But Muhammad's morals were even worse than the Arabs of the time of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic preachers today do false propaganda that killing prisoners (who surrendered) is not allowed. But this is a lie, as Muhammad himself killed 800 men of Banu Qurayzah, who surrendered and accepted to become prisoners of Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not an exceptional case, but the Quran is itself a witness that the slaughter of prisoners is necessary upon the prophet:&lt;/p&gt;

You desire the frail goods of this world, while Allah desires (for you) the hereafter&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;Narrated 'Imran bin Husain: ... &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;It is for the Imam to decide to be generous with whom he wills among the captives, &lt;strong&gt;or to kill whom he wills among them&lt;/strong&gt;, or to ransom whom he wills among them.&lt;strong&gt; Some of the people of knowledge preferred killing over ransoming&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Awzai' said: &quot;It has been conveyed to me. that this Ayah of ranson (47:4) is abrogated ... It was abrogated by: Kill them wherever you find them (2:191). This was narrated to us by Hannad (who said): &quot;Ibn Al-Mubarak narrated to us, from Al-Awza'i.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishaq bin Mansur said: &quot;I said to Ahmad: 'When the captives are captured' is killing or ransoming better to you?' He said: 'If they are able to ransom (by paying huge amount of money) then there is no harm in it. And if they (are) killed, then I do not know of any harm in it.'&quot; Ishaq said: &quot;Wiping them out is better to me, unless it is someone well-known, so that it is hoped that a large amount (of ransom money) will be obtained for him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Sahih&lt;/strong&gt; (Darussalam)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Islamic preachers claim that Islam forbids killing old men,  women and children. But this is not true regarding the old men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Old men were not useful as slaves (to do work). Thus, Muhammad ordered the killing of the old captives and to not let them live as slaves, while they were useless as servants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Narrated Samurah bin Jundab: That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Kill the elder men among the idolaters and spare the Sharkh (young male children under the age of 12) amont them.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And the Sharkh are the boys who did not begin to grow pubic hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Samurah said that Prophet said: Kill the &lt;strong&gt;elder men&lt;/strong&gt; of Mushrikeen, and spare the Sharkh (boys under the age of 12). The son of Imam Ahmed asked his father about this Hadith, and he further cleared that an elder old man does not normally accept Islam, while the chances of young person accepting Islam is much more than an old man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad killed all the old men in the incident of Banu Qurayzah, but spared the young boys (under the age of 12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Muhammad killed all the boys, who were 12 years old (and had pubic hair).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt; ​​It was narrated that Kathir bin As-Sa'ib said: &quot;The sons of Quraizah told me that they were presented to the Messenger of Allah on the Day of Quraizah, and whoever (among them) had reached puberty, or had grown pubic hair, was killed, and whoever had not reached puberty and had not grown pubic hair was left (alive).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women were innocent. They had no part in the decisions of wars. They neither participated in the wars nor killed any Muslims. But despite this, Muhammad ordered the looting of captive women and then made them slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Muhammad also allowed raping the captive women in a Shia Mutta-type “&lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual Relationship”. This means that after fulfilling the lust, a master handed her over to his brother or any slave. And when all brothers and slaves also raped her one by one, then she was sold to another master, who again raped her, and then sold to the 3rd master .... and this chain of rape of slave women in temporary sexual relationships continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, Kitab-ul-Nikah (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20140719221709/http://sunnah.com/muslim/16/147&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), Sahih Bukhari, Kitab-ul-Qadr (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;http://sunnah.com/bukhari/82/9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;amp; Sahih Bukhari, Kitab-ul-Tauheed (&lt;a class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; href=&quot;http://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/38&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot;&gt;0 Abu Sa'id al-Khadri said: We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired (to have sex with) them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) &lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;we also desired good ransom money for them by selling them)&lt;/strong&gt;. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing 'azl (i.e. withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception so that they don’t become pregnant). But then we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: (Yes, it is allowed, but) it does not matter if you do it or not, while if any soul has to be born up to the Day of Resurrection, then it will be born.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halal International Slave Trading&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving freedom to poor women captives, and letting them go to their relatives, Muhammad made it Halal to use them even for international slave trading. Muhammad sold the Jewish captive women of Banu Qurayzah (who believed in a God) to Kuffar (who were polytheists). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?id=pbrjCQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA22&amp;amp;lpg=PA22&amp;amp;dq=qurayzah+hassan&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=nJhrvGA_Zr&amp;amp;sig=2e6vxMmSwlHttJf5eW7S9kAt_Go&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCGoVChMI5c2tzJ_uxwIVCHAaCh1I5gzO#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=qurayzah%20Najd&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;History of Tabari, vol. 8, page 39&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the apostle sent Sa`d b. Zayd al-Ansari brother of b. `Abdu’l-Ashhal with some of the captive women of B. Qurayza to Najd and he sold them for horses and weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Islamic countries became some of the biggest hubs of international slave trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7T4UafM1PdBGycd5na9nF&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId520834&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Even Children were made SLAVES for the whole of their lives (including their coming Offspring i.e. the Evil of Slavery by Birth)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Children were also made slaves for the whole of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Young and small girls and boys (under the age of 12)  had no role in the wars against Muslims, but still, they were also made slaves for their entire lives and were compelled to serve their Muslim masters for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Even worse, the coming generations of these slave children were also born automatically as slaves too. It was due to the EVIL of “&lt;strong class=&quot;_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU&quot;&gt;Slavery by Birth&lt;/strong&gt;” in Muhammad's Islam.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Buraydah: &lt;br&gt;I hated Ali as I had never hated anyone. ... The Prophet sent to us Ali, and among the female captives was a slave girl who was the finest of the female captives, and he apportioned the Khums (one-fifth of war booty given to the Prophet and his family). Ali divided the shares, and his head was dripping (after taking a ritual bath following sexual intercourse with the slave-girl). We said: &quot;O Abu al-Hasan (i.e. Ali), what is this?!&quot; Ali replied: &quot;Did you not see the slave-girl who was among the female captives? I divided the shares and apportioned Khumus. Then she became part of the Khumus. Then she became part of the household of the Prophet, and then she became part of the house of Ali, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and (thus) I had sexual intercourse with her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading: &lt;/strong&gt;Classed &lt;em&gt;Sahih&lt;/em&gt; by al-Arna'ut&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani answered this criticism and wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استشكل وقوع على على الجارية بغير استبراء وكذلك قسمته لنفسه فأما الأول فمحمول على أنها كانت بكرا غير بالغ ورأى أن مثلها لا يستبرأ كما صار إليه غيره من الصحابة&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was problematic that Ali Had sexual intercourse with the slave-girl without observing&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and also that he apportioned a share for himself.&lt;br&gt;As for the first issue, it is understood that she was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virgin and not pubescent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. He recognized that someone like her need not observe&lt;em&gt; Istibra&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it is in accordance with the practice of other Companions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari 8/67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine the trauma of these small pre-pubescent girls? Their fathers and brothers were killed during the daytime, and Muslim Jihadists were raping them the same night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/56/221&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 3012&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me at a place called Al-Abwa or Waddan, and was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim:1745b&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim 1745b&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is narrated by Sa'b b. Jaththama that he said (to the Holy Prophet): Messenger of Allah, we kill the children of the polytheists during the night raids. He said: &lt;strong&gt;They are from them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words of Muhammad (i.e.  &lt;strong&gt;They are from them&lt;/strong&gt;) are extremely problematic. With these words, he is encouraging his companions to become &lt;strong&gt;merciless &lt;/strong&gt;against children and women during attacks, as there is no problem killing them as they also belong to pagan Kafirs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateral damage is something else. For that, Muhammad had to tell his companions to avoid killing children and women as much as possible if they were not armed against them and attacking them. However, with the usage of the words {&lt;strong&gt;They are from them&lt;/strong&gt; i.e. the pagan Kuffar} he incited hatred in his companions against children and women too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US took thousands of times more precautions than Muhammad, in order to avoid the killing of innocent children and women while bombing the terrorists of al-Qaeda and Taliban and ISIS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

He wrote (in reply) to me that &lt;strong&gt;it was necessary (only) in the early days of Islam.&lt;/strong&gt; The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at the water. He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Why this ruling of invitation to Islam and the last chance to save themselves was abrogated? The answer is, only for the greed of more looting and more women and more graze-lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3012:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Narrated As-Sab bin Jaththama: The Prophet (ﷺ) passed by me at a place called Al-Abwa or Waddan, and was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, &quot;They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans).&quot; Prophet said: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the graze-lands belong to Allah and his prophet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId496684&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Either accept Islam, or you will be beheaded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that JIZYA was allowed only for the 'people of the book' (i.e. Christians, Jews, Magians). As far as polytheists and all other religions were concerned, there was no JIZYA for them, but they had to accept either Islam or be killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam Q&amp;amp;A is the largest Muslim Fatwa Website, which is run by Saudi Salafi Scholars. It writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34770/there-is-no-compulsion-to-accept-islam&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The kuffaar (i.e. polytheists) should be compelled to enter Islam&lt;/strong&gt; if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken (i.e. from the people of book), because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood.&lt;strong&gt; Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allaah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential,&lt;/strong&gt; because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued. &lt;br&gt;Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, &lt;strong&gt;because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why ISIS took Jizya from Christians in Iraq but didn't accept the Jizya from “Yazidis”. Following Muhammad, ISIS slaughtered all the Yazidi men and took all their women as slaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/urn/178860&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 4557&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira: The Verse:--&quot;You (true Muslims) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind.&quot; means, the best of peoples for the people, as you bring them with chains on their necks &lt;strong&gt;till they embrace Islam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId82845&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jizya was enforced only in order to humiliate Jews &amp;amp; Christians&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagans were compelled directly to accept Islam under the threat of beheading them otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Jews &amp;amp; Christians were also compelled Indirectly to accept Islam by humiliating them through Jizya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quran is clear about this humiliation through Jizyah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 9:28-29) يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْمُشْرِكُونَ &lt;strong&gt;نَجَسٌ &lt;/strong&gt;فَلاَ يَقْرَبُواْ الْمَسْجِدَ الْحَرَامَ بَعْدَ عَامِهِمْ هَـذَا وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ عَيْلَةً فَسَوْفَ يُغْنِيكُمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِن شَآءَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ - قَـتِلُواْ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَلاَ بِالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَلاَ يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَلاَ يَدِينُونَ دِينَ الْحَقِّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ حَتَّى يُعْطُواْ الْجِزْيَةَ عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ &lt;strong&gt;صَـغِرُونَ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=9&amp;amp;vid=29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;online link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are &lt;strong&gt;unclean (/impure/filthy)&lt;/strong&gt;; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque ... Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, of the People of the Book (i.e. Christians and Jews and Zoroastrians), until they pay the Jizya (tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;humiliated (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arabic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: صَـغِرُونَ)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here صَـغِرُونَ is an Arabic word, which means humiliation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=9&amp;amp;vid=29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). This same word has also been used in Quran in verse (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=7&amp;amp;vid=119&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;7:119&lt;/a&gt;) and verse (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=7&amp;amp;vid=13&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;7:113&lt;/a&gt;) with the same meaning of “Humiliation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir wrote in the commentary of this verse 9:29 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20180603162803/http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=2566&amp;amp;Itemid=64&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;(and feel themselves subdued.), disgraced, humiliated and belittled&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, Muslims are not allowed to honor the people of Dhimmah or elevate them above Muslims, for they are miserable, disgraced and humiliated. Muslim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, لَا تَبْدَءُوا الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَارَى بِالسَّلَامِ، وَإِذَا لَقِيتُمْ أَحَدَهُمْ فِي طَرِيقٍ فَاضْطَرُّوهُ إِلَى أَضْيَقِه (Do not initiate the Salam to the Jews and Christians, and if you meet any of them in a road, force them to its narrowest alley).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jizya has nothing to do with the exemption of Jihad (as Islam apologists claim). Muslims went for Jihad, and they got a share of the war Booty as a reward, while non-Muslims didn't get any war booty. &lt;/strong&gt;If any Muslim does not go for Jihad, he will not get a share of war booty, but at least he does not have to pay Jizyah. But Jews &amp;amp; Christians will not get a share from war booty, and as well as they have to pay the Jizya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mozTocH2&quot; name=&quot;mozTocId671002&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Destroying the Temple, and killing the priests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4355&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4355:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Narrated Jarir: In the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance there was a house called Dhu-l-Khalasa or Al-Ka`ba Al- Yamaniya or Al-Ka`ba Ash-Shamiya. The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, &quot;Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l- Khalasa?&quot; So I set out with one-hundred-and-fifty riders,&lt;strong&gt; and we dismantled it and killed whoever was present there&lt;/strong&gt;. Then I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and informed him, and he invoked good upon us and Al- Ahmas (tribe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4357&quot;&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 4357&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Dhul-l--Khulasa was a house in Yemen belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka`ba.&quot; &lt;strong&gt;Jarir went there, burnt it with fire and dismantled it&lt;/strong&gt;. When Jarir reached Yemen, there was a man who used to foretell and give good omens by casting arrows of divination. Someone said to him. &quot;The messenger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is present here and if he should get hold of you, he would chop off your neck.&quot; One day while he was using them (i.e. arrows of divination), Jarir stopped there and said to him,&lt;strong&gt; &quot;Break them (i.e. the arrows) and testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, or else I will chop off your neck.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; So the man broke those arrows and testified that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long Islam apologists are going to hide this real face of Islam? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was the Day of Badr and Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) had gained victory over them (the Meccans), he commanded more than twenty persons, and in another hadith these are counted as twenty-four persons, from the non-believers of the Quraish to be thrown into the well of Badr. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;No woman of Banu Qurayzah was killed except one. She was with me, talking and laughing on her back and belly (extremely), while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was killing her people with the swords. Suddenly a man called her name: Where is so-and-so? She said: I I asked: What is the matter with you? She said: I did a new act. She said: The man took her and beheaded her. She said: I will not forget that she was laughing extremely although she knew that she would be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zayd also raided Wadi-l-Qurra where he met Banu Fazara and some of his companions were killed; he himself carried wounded from the field. Ward b. Amr b. Madash one of B. Sad b. Hudhayl was killed by one of B. Badr whose name Sa’d b. Hudhaym. When Zayd came he swore that he would use no ablution until he raided B. Fazara; and when he recovered from his wounds the apostle sent him against them with a force. He fought them in Wadi-al-Qura and killed some of them. Qays b. al-Musahhar al-Yamuri killed Mas’ada b. Hakama b. Malik b. Hudhayfa b. Badr and Umm Qirfa Fatima was taken prisoner. She was a very old woman, wife of Malik. Her daughter and Abdulla b. Mas’ada were also taken. &lt;b&gt;Zaid ordered Qays b al-Musahhar to kill Umm Qirfa and he killed her cruelly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Allah’s Messenger sent Zayd to Wadi Qura, where he encountered the Banu Fazarah. Some of his Companions were killed, and Zayd was carried away wounded. Ward was slain by the Banu Badr. When Zayd returned, he vowed that no washing should touch his head until he had raided the Fazarah. After he recovered, Muhammad sent him with an army against the Fazarah settlement. He met them in Qura and inflicted casualties on them and took Umm Qirfah prisoner. He also took one of Umm’s daughters and Abdallah bin Mas’adah prisoner. &lt;b&gt;Zyad bin Harithah ordered Qays to kill Umm, and he killed her cruelly. He tied each of her legs with a rope and tied the ropes to two camels, and they split her in two.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter: Permissibility of cutting down the trees of the Kuffar and burning them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Umar that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) caused the date-palms of Banu Nadir to be cut down and burnt. ... in the same connection was revealed the Qur'anic verse:&quot; Whatever trees you have cut down or left standing on their trunks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, Muhammad brought 100% destruction upon his opponents. He slaughtered men or made them slaves. He took all women as slaves and let his companions rape them. He also made all small children slaves for their entire lives (although they were innocent and had no role in wars). And the later generations of those slave children were also automatically born as slaves due to the evil of Slavery By Birth in Islam. &lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Muslims are quick to demand equal human rights, including the right to preach and criticize, and to convert people to Islam in non-Muslim countries. But in their own Muslim countries, they don't allow non-Muslims even to preach to Muslims, criticize Islam as an ideology, or convert Muslims to their religion/ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every criticism of Islam is accused of blasphemy and people are killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not even a single book can be published which criticizes Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exist millions of ex-Muslims in Islamic countries, but &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OFFICIALLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, there exists not even a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ex-Muslim in any Muslim country (except for secular Turkey and former Soviet Muslim states). This means, these millions of ex-Muslims are forced to hide their beliefs and they are forced to live a dangerous double life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims want to talk about Islamophobia, they are most welcome. But then let us also talk about their diseases of Homophobia, Murtadophobia (i.e. Apostatephobia), Kafirophobia, and their Double Standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamweb.Net is the largest Muslim Website. It writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/85662/restrictions-placed-by-muslims-on-non-muslims-etc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mainitem  quest-fatwa&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;d-flex&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;mainitemtitle2&quot;&gt;Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of religion is a very important and clear concept in islam. My question is that: how is the concept of &quot;no compulsion in religion&quot; in Islam fit or contradict with two other facts about Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) No Christian (or other religion) missionaries are allowed to preach their religion in the &quot;Islamic state&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I know that Islam is the only true religion, but apparently 80% of world's population do not believe so). I understand that Islam asks every country to allow Muslims to deliver the message of Islam to their people, and their people can then accept or refuse the message without compulsion, however, if that country refuses to give Muslims this right to deliver the message, then Muslims can fight them for that. So, how Islam asks from other countries something that Islam don't offer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The second issue is that any Muslim who converts from Islam to another religion should be subjected to death according to &quot;Islamic law&quot;, although that Muslim might have been a Muslim because he was born as such and he didn't have a choice, and when he did his own search he wanted to convert to another religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clear&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mainitem quest-fatwa&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;mainitemtitle2&quot;&gt;Answer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds; and may His blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his Family and Companions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In reality, Islam is the religion of truth that all people are required to accept, and Allah will not accept any others religion on the Day of Judgement. &lt;br&gt;Then, Islam does not force people to follow it, but according to its teachings all people are required to obey its authority who live under its rule in the Islamic State. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In simple words all non-Muslims (Zimmi or others) are not allowed to invite others to follow disbelief, nor to demonstrate it or spread it, i.e. no Christian, Jewish, Buddhist or any other follower of false religion and ideology can spread his false creed in the Islamic State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means that a non-Muslim resident in the Islamic State can remain on his religion and Muslims are required to avoid hurting him as long as he is committed to his covenant with Muslims. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;But, this freedom of creed does not entitle him to invite other to his religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islam is the religion of truth, and only the one whose heart is closed, whose sight and hearing are sealed will refuse to follow Islam. Thus, it becomes a duty for every Muslim to invite others to Islam and to spread its teachings in all places and at all times. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Also, all obstacles, which prevent Islam from being propagated are to be destroyed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #2800ff;&quot;&gt;(i.e. Jihad becomes obligatory if non-Muslim state does not allow preaching of Islam or let people convert to Islam)&lt;/span&gt; so that every man on earth receives the message of Islam. Then, he/she is free to choose Islam or submit to the Muslim authority by paying the Jizya.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;As for the one who embraced Islam and then disbelieved, he has committed by this act a major crime for which he should be killed&lt;/span&gt; unless he returns again to Islam after being a believer. Apostasy constitutes a form of frivolous play and immortality. So, an apostate becomes a vicious member in the Muslim society that should be cut off before spreading evil to others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we state that killing such a wicked member can only be ordered by the Muslim ruler, and should not be done before using all possible means to make him return to Islam, i.e. he must be shown his errors, asked to repent and to re-embrace Islam. If he does not accept, then the ruler or his agent orders that he be killed as a way of establishing the retributive punishments of Shari'ah. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means that he is considered as a killer of himself because of his refusal to return to Islam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;advocates of positive laws that disapprove of this punishment (killing the apostate) consider anyone who commits a breach of the political system or the constitution as a traitor&lt;/strong&gt; i.e. one who commits treason, and thus deserves capital punishment or life imprisonment. In Islam it is natural to punish the apostate who betrays Allah, His Messenger and his religion in the same way, since no doubt his crime is much greater than just betraying the political system or breaking man-made laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mainitem quest-fatwa&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear fellow humans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to bring to your attention the dire situation faced by ex-Muslims, particularly women, in Islamic countries. While Ahmadi Muslims and Muslim women also face oppression, the struggles of ex-Muslims are unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Muslims are forced to live a double life, constantly fearful of being discovered and punished for their disbelief. They cannot confide in anyone, not even their closest friends or family members, as they risk being betrayed and exposed. Yes, this is these are the stories of thousands of ex-Muslims on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/&quot;&gt;ex-Muslim subreddit&lt;/a&gt; that they will be surely killed by their families if they know about their apostasy. This perpetual state of secrecy takes a heavy mental toll on individuals, causing anxiety, depression, and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ex-Muslim women face unique challenges that Muslim women do not experience. They are coerced into wearing the hijab, a symbol of modesty and piety, despite not believing in its significance. They are pressured into marrying Muslim men chosen by their families, leading to loveless and oppressive relationships. Moreover, they are expected to fulfill their husbands' sexual desires for the rest of their lives, regardless of their personal feelings or consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most distressing aspect is that ex-Muslims cannot share their innermost thoughts and beliefs with their children, who are innocent and might reveal their secret. They are compelled to send their offspring to Quran schools and mosques, further reinforcing the religion they reject. This constant pretending and hiding their true selves take a tremendous emotional toll on individuals, leaving them feeling suffocated and trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the numerous ex-Muslims living in Islamic countries, there isn't a single officially recognized ex-Muslim organization. This lack of representation means their struggles remain hidden from the international community, and they cannot advocate for their rights or seek support. The world remains largely oblivious to their existence and the hardships they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to consider the immense challenges confronting ex-Muslims, particularly women, and lend your voice to their cause. Together, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society where individuals can freely choose their beliefs and express themselves without fear of persecution.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Muslims are quick to demand equal human rights, including the right to preach and criticize, and to convert people to Islam in non-Muslim countries. But in their own Muslim countries, they don't allow non-Muslims even to preach to Muslims, criticize Islam as an ideology, or convert Muslims to their religion/ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every criticism of Islam is accused of blasphemy and people are killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not even a single book can be published which criticizes Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exist millions of ex-Muslims in Islamic countries, but &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OFFICIALLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, there exists not even a &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ex-Muslim in any Muslim country (except for secular Turkey and former Soviet Muslim states). This means, these millions of ex-Muslims are forced to hide their beliefs and they are forced to live a dangerous double life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims want to talk about Islamophobia, they are most welcome. But then let us also talk about their diseases of Homophobia, Murtadophobia (i.e. Apostatephobia), Kafirophobia, and their Double Standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamweb.Net is the largest Muslim Website. It writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/85662/restrictions-placed-by-muslims-on-non-muslims-etc&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mainitem  quest-fatwa&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;d-flex&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;mainitemtitle2&quot;&gt;Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of religion is a very important and clear concept in islam. My question is that: how is the concept of &quot;no compulsion in religion&quot; in Islam fit or contradict with two other facts about Islam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) No Christian (or other religion) missionaries are allowed to preach their religion in the &quot;Islamic state&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I know that Islam is the only true religion, but apparently 80% of world's population do not believe so). I understand that Islam asks every country to allow Muslims to deliver the message of Islam to their people, and their people can then accept or refuse the message without compulsion, however, if that country refuses to give Muslims this right to deliver the message, then Muslims can fight them for that. So, how Islam asks from other countries something that Islam don't offer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The second issue is that any Muslim who converts from Islam to another religion should be subjected to death according to &quot;Islamic law&quot;, although that Muslim might have been a Muslim because he was born as such and he didn't have a choice, and when he did his own search he wanted to convert to another religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clear&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mainitem quest-fatwa&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;mainitemtitle2&quot;&gt;Answer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds; and may His blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his Family and Companions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In reality, Islam is the religion of truth that all people are required to accept, and Allah will not accept any others religion on the Day of Judgement. &lt;br&gt;Then, Islam does not force people to follow it, but according to its teachings all people are required to obey its authority who live under its rule in the Islamic State. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In simple words all non-Muslims (Zimmi or others) are not allowed to invite others to follow disbelief, nor to demonstrate it or spread it, i.e. no Christian, Jewish, Buddhist or any other follower of false religion and ideology can spread his false creed in the Islamic State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means that a non-Muslim resident in the Islamic State can remain on his religion and Muslims are required to avoid hurting him as long as he is committed to his covenant with Muslims. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;But, this freedom of creed does not entitle him to invite other to his religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islam is the religion of truth, and only the one whose heart is closed, whose sight and hearing are sealed will refuse to follow Islam. Thus, it becomes a duty for every Muslim to invite others to Islam and to spread its teachings in all places and at all times. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Also, all obstacles, which prevent Islam from being propagated are to be destroyed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #2800ff;&quot;&gt;(i.e. Jihad becomes obligatory if non-Muslim state does not allow preaching of Islam or let people convert to Islam)&lt;/span&gt; so that every man on earth receives the message of Islam. Then, he/she is free to choose Islam or submit to the Muslim authority by paying the Jizya.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;As for the one who embraced Islam and then disbelieved, he has committed by this act a major crime for which he should be killed&lt;/span&gt; unless he returns again to Islam after being a believer. Apostasy constitutes a form of frivolous play and immortality. So, an apostate becomes a vicious member in the Muslim society that should be cut off before spreading evil to others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we state that killing such a wicked member can only be ordered by the Muslim ruler, and should not be done before using all possible means to make him return to Islam, i.e. he must be shown his errors, asked to repent and to re-embrace Islam. If he does not accept, then the ruler or his agent orders that he be killed as a way of establishing the retributive punishments of Shari'ah. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means that he is considered as a killer of himself because of his refusal to return to Islam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;advocates of positive laws that disapprove of this punishment (killing the apostate) consider anyone who commits a breach of the political system or the constitution as a traitor&lt;/strong&gt; i.e. one who commits treason, and thus deserves capital punishment or life imprisonment. In Islam it is natural to punish the apostate who betrays Allah, His Messenger and his religion in the same way, since no doubt his crime is much greater than just betraying the political system or breaking man-made laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that ISIS took Jizya from Christians in Iraq and let them live, but ISIS didn't take Jizya from Yazidis and killed their men and enslaved their women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Salafi Islam (and also according to Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal), Jizya is allowed only for Christians/Jews/Zoroastrians (who are known as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahl_al-kit%C4%81b&quot;&gt;people of the Book أهل الكتاب&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in Islam).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But as far as other non-Muslims (like Atheists, Deists, Hindus, Buddhists etc.) are concerned, then they cannot live even by paying Jizya. They either have to accept Islam, or they should be slaughtered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad himself didn't accept Jizya from the polytheists of Arabia but after the revelation of the verse of the sword (i.e. killing all polytheists after 4 months), he forced all of them to accept Islam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, some Muslim jurists like Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik said that it was limited only to the polytheists of Arabia, but as far as the polytheists of the non-Arab world are concerned, they could live by paying Jizya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other Muslim jurists like Imam Shafii and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (and modern-day Salafists) disagree. According to them, non-Arab non-Muslims also don't have any right to live even through paying Jizya. They either have to accept Islam or they should be slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if Salafists form an Islamic State today, then they will kill all non-Muslims like Atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, etc. (accept for Jews/Christians/Magians who can stay alive by paying Jizya). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Details: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.5&quot;&gt;9:5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;establish&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; prayer, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and give&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; zakah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;i.e. if they become Muslims&lt;/em&gt;), let them [go] on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quranic Verse about killing polytheists has become a problem for Islam apologists, while the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) ordered to kill “&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; polytheists” in it if they don't accept Islam. They were not even allowed to stay alive by paying the Jizya (Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.29&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;), which was reserved only for Jews &amp;amp; Christians. This was the main tactic which Muhammad used to spread Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Wahidi recorded under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=86&amp;amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;amp;tAyahNo=105&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=2&quot;&gt;Tafsir of verse 5:105&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn 'Abbas said: “The Messenger of Allah sent a letter to the people of Hajar, whose chief was Mundhir ibn Sawa, inviting them to Islam, or to pay the Jizyah if they chose not to embrace Islam. When Mundhir ibn Sawa received the letter, he showed it to the Arabs, Jews, Christians, Sabeans and Magians who were around him. They all agreed to pay the Jizyah and disliked embracing Islam. &lt;strong&gt;The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, wrote back to him, saying: 'As for the Arabs, do not accept from them except Islam otherwise they will have nothing but the sword. As for the people of the Book and the Magians, accept the Jizyah from them.&lt;/strong&gt; When this letter was read to them, the Arabs embraced Islam while the people of the Book and the Magians agreed to pay the Jizyah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today Muslims are weaker than other nations, therefore Islam apologists are forced to hide the real face of Islam. They fear if the rest of the world comes to know it, then polytheists are going to kill Muslims as Muhammad used to slaughter the polytheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 9th Hijri year (one year before his death), Muhammad got “absolute power” and no one was left there in the entire Arabia who could have opposed him. Thus, then in the 9th Hijri year, Muhammad claimed the revelation of verse 9:5 and made the killing of all polytheists Halal (permissible) for Muslims. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The peace treaty which Muhammad signed in the 7th Hijri year (at the time of the victory of Mecca) was not with the whole of Arabia, but only with the tribes living in Mecca and around it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, whoever had a covenant, their covenant lasted till the end of the covenant. While the other polytheists, who didn't have any covenant, their killing started after 4 months. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allah (i.e. Muhammad) didn't even allow polytheists to stay alive after paying Jizya (i.e. only Jews, Christians and Magians were allowed to live by paying Jizya)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quranic verse 9:29 testifies two issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, to wage a war against Jews and Christians was not due to the reason that they were fighting Muslims, but it was due to the reason that they didn’t believe in Allah and Muhammad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, Jizya was limited only to Jews and Christians. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.29&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Fight those people of the Book (Jews and Christians) who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, do not refrain from what has been prohibited by Allah and His Messenger and do not embrace the religion of truth (Al-Islam), until they pay Jizya (protection tax) with their own hands and feel themselves subdued.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Allah (i.e. Muhammad) limited Jizya only to the “People of the Book” (i.e. Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians) in this verse, while polytheists were not even allowed to live after paying the Jizya. &lt;strong&gt;Polytheists either had to accept Islam, or they would be killed after 4 months (or till the end of their covenant). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are traditions which are clear about how Muslims killed even peaceful polytheists after the revelation of this verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Battles (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hadithurdu.com/01/1-2-1544/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Narrated Jarir: In the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance there was a house called Dhu-l-Khalasa or Al-Ka'ba Al-Yamaniya or Al-Ka'ba Ash-Shamiya. The Prophet said to me, &quot;Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l-Khalasa?&quot; So I set out with one-hundred-and-fifty riders, and we dismantled it and killed whoever was present there. Then I came to the Prophet and informed him, and he invoked good upon us and Al-Ahmas (tribe) .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musanif Ibn Abi Shaybah, 6/586, Kitab-ul-Hadood, chapter of في الزنادقة ما حدهم (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hadithportal.com/index.php?show=bab&amp;amp;bab_id=4412&amp;amp;chapter_id=24&amp;amp;book=62&amp;amp;sub_idBab=0&amp;amp;f=4245&amp;amp;e=4426&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Some people used to worship their idols secretly. They were arrested and brought to 4th caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib. He consulted the people how to punish them. People suggested to kill them. Ali said: No, I will not simply kill them, but I will do that act which was performed by them against my ancestor Abraham. After that Ali burnt all of them in the fire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disagreement among Muslim Scholars regarding the killing of ALL Polytheists after the death of Muhammad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Muslim Scholars agree that Muhammad didn't leave any polytheist to survive by paying Jizya. He compelled them either to accept Islam or to be slaughtered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shamela.ws/book/767/5031&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Al-Muhalla bi’l-Aathaar&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;لم يختلف مسلمان في أن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - لم يقبل من الوثنيين من العرب إلا الإسلام أو السيف&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no difference among the Muslims that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not accept anything from the Arab idolators except Islam or the sword&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=DyUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ikhtilaf al-Fuqaha&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أجمعوا على أن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - أبى أخذ الجزية من عبدة الأوثان من العرب ولم يقبل منهم إلا الإسلام أو السيف&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is consensus that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ refused to accept Jizya from the idol worshipers from the Arabs and did not accept anything from them except Islam or the sword&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the disagreement occurred later among the opinions of 4 Sunni Imams: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (and present-day Salafists) all rule that except for Jews/Christians/Magians, all other non-Muslims (like Atheists, Buddhists, Hindus etc.) should be killed all over the world. They don't have any right to stay alive even after paying Jizya. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik said that the killing of all other non-Muslims was limited only to the Arab polytheists. But non-Arab polytheists can be allowed to stay alive by paying Jizya. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٰIbn Kathir wrote under the commentary of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quran.com/9:29/tafsirs/ar-tafsir-ibn-kathir&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استدل بهـذه الآية الكريمة من يرى أنه لا تؤخذ الجزية إلا من أهل الكتاب أو من أشباههم كالمجوس كما صح فيهم الحديث أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذها من مجوس هجر وهذا مذهب الشافعي وأحمد في المشهور عنه وقال أبو حنيفة رحمه الله: بل تؤخذ من جميع الأعاجم سواء كانوا من أهل الكتاب أو من المشركين ولا تؤخذ من العرب إلا من أهل الكتاب. وقال الإمام مالك: بل يجوز أن تضرب الجزية على جميع الكفار من كتابي ومجوسي ووثني وغير ذلك ولمأخذ هذه المذاهب&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;3:1-3:342&quot;&gt;This noble verse was cited as evidence by those who believe that the jizya (a tax paid by non-Muslims living in a Muslim-majority state) should only be collected from the People of the Book or from those who are similar to them, such as the Zoroastrians. This is the opinion of Imam al-Shafi'i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his most famous opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;5:1-5:217&quot;&gt;Abu Hanifa said: &quot;On the contrary, the jizya should be collected from all non-Arabs, whether they are People of the Book or polytheists. However, it should only be collected from Arabs if they are People of the Book.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;7:1-7:165&quot;&gt;Imam Malik said: &quot;On the contrary, it is permissible to impose the jizya on all infidels, whether they are People of the Book, Zoroastrians, polytheists, or others.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ijma' (Consensus) of the Companions of Muhammad still allows killing all non-Arab non-Muslims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik gave a ruling that all non-Arab non-Muslims are allowed to stay alive by paying Jizya, but it goes against the direct consensus of the Companions of Muhammad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Umar Ibn Khattab conquered Persia, he used this same verse 9:5 as an argument to kill them, and all the Sahaba (companions) stayed quiet upon it and no one opposed Umar Ibn Khattab by telling him that this verse was limited to Polytheist of Mecca or Arabia only. Therefore, there was an IJMA (unanimous decision) by Sahaba upon this verse that it ordered the killing of all the Polytheists (even if they are non-Arabs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Umar Ibn Khattab didn’t kill the Persians while Ali and 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf told him that Magians of Persia were also counted as “People of the Book” by Prophet Muhammad. Thus, he took Jazya from them, and then he let them live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqallani recorded this Sahih (authentic) tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001053419/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=5744&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;وروى عبد بن حميد في تفسير سورة البروج بإسناد صحيح عن ابن أبزى &quot; لما هزم المسلمون أهل فارس قال عمر : اجتمعوا . فقال : إن المجوس ليسوا أهل كتاب فنضع عليهم ، ولا من عبدة الأوثان فنجري عليهم أحكامهم فقال علي : بل هم أهل كتاب &quot;’&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;When Muslims defeated the Persians, then Umar Ibn Khattab asked Sahaba (companions) to gather and to tell him what to do with the Persians as they are neither from the “People of Book” that they could take Jizya from them, and nor were they the polytheists that they should all be killed. Upon that Ali Ibn Abi Talib told him that Magians were also counted as “People of the Book”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Persians escaped the slaughter while they were also counted as the “People of the Book”, otherwise they would have also been killed as polytheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order to kill the polytheists was not limited to the era of Muhammad (but this order stays true even after his death).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And it was also not limited to only Arabia, but all non-Muslims of the whole world have to be killed by Muslims. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this “authentic” tradition of Sunan Abu Dawud (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001054259/http://dorar.net/h/0916f8e2ca3e8b9006f8ca7e4cf93e8c&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;لم يكن عمر يأخذ الجزية من المجوس حتى شهد عبد الرحمن بن عوف أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذها من مجوس هجر .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab didn’t want to take Jizya (but wanted to kill them all), but 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf told him that Prophet Muhammad took Jizya from the Zoroastrians of the place of Hijr.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Present-day Salafis still consider that all polytheists of the whole world should be killed according to the order of verse 9:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Grand Mufti Ibn Baaz wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001042634/http://www.binbaz.org.sa/node/277&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;، والأرجح أنه لا يلحق بهم غيرهم ، بل هؤلاء الطوائف الثلاث هم الذين يخيرون ؛ لأن الرسول قاتل الكفار في الجزيرة ولم يقبل منهم إلا الإسلام ، &lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;And the correct view is this that polytheists (of today) do not come under the category of “people of the book”, but only Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians are allowed to live by paying Jizya, while Prophet Muhammad killed all the polytheists in Arabia and accepted nothing from them, except Islam.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Salafi Fatwa Website for Muslims, i.e. Islam Question Answers wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34770/there-is-no-compulsion-to-accept-islam&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Other scholars said that this (verse of No compulsion in the religion (Quran 2:256) applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad (Quran 9:5). So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people (of book) who may pay jizyah (i.e. Jews/Christian/Zoroastrians). The kuffaar (polytheists) should be compelled to enter Islam if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken, because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Other scholars said that this applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad. So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people who may pay jizyah.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood. Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allaah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential, because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not say, “if they pay the jizyah”. The Jews, Christians and Magians are to be asked to enter Islam; if they refuse then they should be asked to pay the jizyah. If they refuse to pay the jizyah then the Muslims must fight them if they are able to do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allaah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger  (Muhammad), (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:29]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted the jizyah from the Magians, but it was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) accepted the jizyah from anyone except the three groups mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179; background-color: #ecf0f1;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is why ISIS allowed the Christians of Iraq to pay Jizya and didn’t kill them. But ISIS didn’t accept any Jizya from the Yazidi community of Iraq, and they killed the Yazidi men and took all their women and children as slaves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Shafii, Hanbalis or Salafists of today form an Islamic State/Caliphate today, then again they will start killing all the polytheists and will not accept any Jizya from them. In this regard, there is no difference of opinion between ISIS and the Salafists (and all the followers of Imam Sahafii and Ahmed bin Hanbal). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic apologists: Verse 9:6 permits to give shelter to Polytheists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists come up with this excuse today that verse 9:5 didn’t order the killing of all the polytheists, while verse 9:6 allows giving shelter to the polytheists too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excuse is wrong, verse 9:5 is about the polytheists who live within the boundaries of the Islamic State (Dar al-Salam, while verse 9:6 is only about such polytheists who come from the Non-Muslim States (Dar al-Kufr), and thus they have not heard the message of Islam earlier. Therefore, if such polytheists want to hear the message of Islam, then they can be given shelter for a short period temporarily. But after that temporary period, those polytheists should either accept Islam, or return to their respective non-Muslim State, and they are not allowed to permanently live in the Islamic State. According to Muslim Scholars, this temporary period could be from 4 months to one year maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=9&amp;amp;vid=6&quot;&gt;Quran 9:6&lt;/a&gt;) If any of the pagans ask you to give them refuge, give them asylum so that they may hear the words of God. Then, return them to their towns for they are ignorant people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of this verse 9:6 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=9&amp;amp;tAyahNo=6&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;والغرض أن من قدم من دار الحرب إلى دار الإسلام في أداء رسالة، أو تجارة، أو طلب صلح، أو مهادنة، أو حمل جزية، أو نحو ذلك من الأسباب، وطلب من الإمام أو نائبه أماناً، أعطي أماناً ما دام متردداً في دار الإسلام، وحتى يرجع إلى مأمنه ووطنه، لكن قال العلماء لا يجوز أن يمكن من الإقامة في دار الإسلام سنة، ويجوز أن يمكن من إقامة أربعة أشهر، وفيما بين ذلك فيما زاد على أربعة أشهر، ونقص عن سنة ، قولان عن الإمام الشافعي وغيره من العلماء رحمهم الله.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... those who come from a state of non-Muslims, to the area of Islam, delivering a message, for business transactions, to negotiate a peace treaty, to pay the Jizyah, to offer an end to hostilities, and so forth, and request safe passage from Muslim leaders or their deputies, should be granted safe passage, as long as they remain in Muslim areas, until they go back to their land and sanctuary. Scholars say that such a person should not be allowed to stay in Muslim area more than one year. He could stay for four months to one year, and there is a difference between the sayings of Imam Shafii etc. among the Scholars etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compulsion in Religion: Muhammad compelled the Polytheists to accept Islam or to be killed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamists decieve the world by claiming that there is no COIMPULSION in religion, but hide the fact that Muhammad himself compelled all Polytheists to convert to islam or to be killed. It happened when Muhammad got absolute power and feared no resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the revelation of verse of the Sword (Quran 9:5), Muhammad send all Arab polytheists a letter/message that after 4 months, either all Polytheists had to convert to Islam, or they would be killed, and they could not stay alive on their polytheism by paying Jizya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the excuse was made that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prophet invited the Arab Polytheists to Islam through a letter/message. In doing so, he made the &quot;Completion of Proof&quot; (Itmam al-Hujjah إتمام الحجة).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arab polytheists had the same Arabic language as the Quran. Thus they were able to understand the MESSAGE clearly. But despite that, when they deny to accept the messages, they deserved to be killed. The non-Arab polytheists didn't get this punishment, while they were not able to understand the message while their language is not Arabic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the existence of Allah has not been proven, yet Islamists have justified killing people in the name of Itmam al-Hujjah (The Completion of Proof) by Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows anyone to claim that they are a prophet of Allah, and by simply being present and delivering the message, they have completed the proof (Itmam al-Hujjah). If people do not believe, Allah will bring down punishment through the swords of his followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah were to send miraculous punishments such as storms, earthquakes, etc., on those who deny prophethood, it would still make sense because such natural disasters would be &quot;proof&quot; of Allah's existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the problem is that it has never been proven that Allah has sent any earthquake or punishment on a nation that denied prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These earthquakes and storms occur to Muslims who confirm prophethood just as they do to non-Muslims. Science has proven that these earthquakes are not due to miracles but occur in regions with fault lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the occurrence of these earthquakes and natural disasters is not proof of Allah's existence but evidence of Allah's &quot;non-existence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, Islamists make &quot;claims&quot; based on conjecture and then insist that this is a &quot;proof.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, understand that it is a contradiction in the Quran to say on one hand &quot;There is no compulsion in religion,&quot; and on the other hand, to force people to accept Islam by threatening punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human reason clearly guides that punishment should have only occurred when disbelievers were oppressing the Muslims (the Prophet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was not the case with the polytheists of Arabia. They were subjugated and in no way oppressing or killing Muslims or the Prophet. So, in this case, forcing them and threatening to kill them with the excuse of punishment to coerce them into accepting Islam is proof of contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the disbelievers were truly oppressing Muslims and the Prophet, Allah was absent, and there was no punishment of any kind (whether in the form of natural disasters or the sword).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If Umar ibn al-Khattab took 7 years to accept Islam, then how could illiterate and less intelligent Bedouin polytheists believe in just one letter/message?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophet Muhammad preached for 13 years in Mecca, but apart from a few people from his family, tribe, and the people of Mecca, no one believed, even though Muhammad was directly delivering the message to them. Even after the conquest of Mecca in 7 AH, the Quraysh did not believe. Muhammad bribed them and set stipends for them (Mu'allafatu al-Qulub Quran 9:60). But even then, they did not believe. Only after the verse of Sword (Quran 9:t) did they forcibly accept Islam. So, how can it be expected that illiterate and less intelligent Bedouin polytheists would believe in just one letter/message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Umar ibn al-Khattab received the message directly from Muhammad but did not believe for 7 years and was ready to kill Muhammad. So, how can it be expected that illiterate and less intelligent Bedouin polytheists would believe in just one letter/message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there were countless polytheists who, based on reasoning, completely rejected Muhammad's claim of prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, your human reason will clearly guide you that if understanding the message was the issue, then the Jews and Christians should have understood Muhammad's message first. But isn't it strange that Jews and Christians are allowed to live by paying jizya, while illiterate Bedouin polytheists are to be killed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When Islam Was Weak, the Prophet's Job Was Only to &quot;Deliver the Message,&quot; Not to Compel, but When Islam Became Powerful, the Prophet's Job Was to &quot;Compel&quot; Too&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mecca and the early period in Medina, when Islam was weak and people were not accepting Muhammad's invitation, the Quran's narrative was that the Prophet's job was only to &quot;deliver the message,&quot; not to force it upon others because the Prophet is neither a guardian nor a keeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the following verses, all from the Meccan or early Medinan period when Islam was weak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O Prophet! Your duty is only to deliver the message, not to make them believe.&lt;/strong&gt; (An-Nahl 16:82)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prophet cannot compel anyone to guidance.&lt;/strong&gt; (28:56)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you force people to believe?&lt;/strong&gt; (10:99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prophet is not made a guardian over the people.&lt;/strong&gt; (17:54)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O Prophet, you are only a warner, and Allah has power over everything.&lt;/strong&gt; (Hud 11:12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your duty is to deliver the message, and it is Our duty to take account.&lt;/strong&gt; (Ar-Ra'd 13:40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are not appointed as a guardian over them; your duty is to deliver the message.&lt;/strong&gt; (Ash-Shura 42:48)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(The Prophets said) Our duty is only to deliver the message.&lt;/strong&gt; (Ya-Sin 36:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Admonish, for your duty is only to admonish; you are not a keeper over them.&lt;/strong&gt; (Al-Ghashiyah 88:22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the early period in Medina, when Islam was weak, the verse came, &quot;There is no compulsion in religion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Islam became powerful in 9 AH and there was no one in Arabia to challenge Islam, Muhammad claimed the revelation of the verse of Qital, after which the Prophet's job now included forcibly making people accept the message and, in case of refusal, to carry out a massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't take the danger of Islam lightly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't let Islamic apologists fool you by presenting Islam as a harmless religion till the time they are weaker than you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Summary:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that ISIS took Jizya from Christians in Iraq and let them live, but ISIS didn't take Jizya from Yazidis and killed their men and enslaved their women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to Salafi Islam (and also according to Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal), Jizya is allowed only for Christians/Jews/Zoroastrians (who are known as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahl_al-kit%C4%81b&quot;&gt;people of the Book أهل الكتاب&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in Islam).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But as far as other non-Muslims (like Atheists, Deists, Hindus, Buddhists etc.) are concerned, then they cannot live even by paying Jizya. They either have to accept Islam, or they should be slaughtered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muhammad himself didn't accept Jizya from the polytheists of Arabia but after the revelation of the verse of the sword (i.e. killing all polytheists after 4 months), he forced all of them to accept Islam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, some Muslim jurists like Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik said that it was limited only to the polytheists of Arabia, but as far as the polytheists of the non-Arab world are concerned, they could live by paying Jizya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other Muslim jurists like Imam Shafii and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (and modern-day Salafists) disagree. According to them, non-Arab non-Muslims also don't have any right to live even through paying Jizya. They either have to accept Islam or they should be slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if Salafists form an Islamic State today, then they will kill all non-Muslims like Atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, etc. (accept for Jews/Christians/Magians who can stay alive by paying Jizya). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Details: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.5&quot;&gt;9:5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent,&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;establish&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; prayer, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and give&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; zakah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;i.e. if they become Muslims&lt;/em&gt;), let them [go] on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quranic Verse about killing polytheists has become a problem for Islam apologists, while the writer of the Quran (i.e. Muhammad) ordered to kill “&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; polytheists” in it if they don't accept Islam. They were not even allowed to stay alive by paying the Jizya (Verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.29&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;), which was reserved only for Jews &amp;amp; Christians. This was the main tactic which Muhammad used to spread Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Wahidi recorded under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=86&amp;amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;amp;tAyahNo=105&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=2&quot;&gt;Tafsir of verse 5:105&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn 'Abbas said: “The Messenger of Allah sent a letter to the people of Hajar, whose chief was Mundhir ibn Sawa, inviting them to Islam, or to pay the Jizyah if they chose not to embrace Islam. When Mundhir ibn Sawa received the letter, he showed it to the Arabs, Jews, Christians, Sabeans and Magians who were around him. They all agreed to pay the Jizyah and disliked embracing Islam. &lt;strong&gt;The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, wrote back to him, saying: 'As for the Arabs, do not accept from them except Islam otherwise they will have nothing but the sword. As for the people of the Book and the Magians, accept the Jizyah from them.&lt;/strong&gt; When this letter was read to them, the Arabs embraced Islam while the people of the Book and the Magians agreed to pay the Jizyah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today Muslims are weaker than other nations, therefore Islam apologists are forced to hide the real face of Islam. They fear if the rest of the world comes to know it, then polytheists are going to kill Muslims as Muhammad used to slaughter the polytheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 9th Hijri year (one year before his death), Muhammad got “absolute power” and no one was left there in the entire Arabia who could have opposed him. Thus, then in the 9th Hijri year, Muhammad claimed the revelation of verse 9:5 and made the killing of all polytheists Halal (permissible) for Muslims. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The peace treaty which Muhammad signed in the 7th Hijri year (at the time of the victory of Mecca) was not with the whole of Arabia, but only with the tribes living in Mecca and around it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, whoever had a covenant, their covenant lasted till the end of the covenant. While the other polytheists, who didn't have any covenant, their killing started after 4 months. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allah (i.e. Muhammad) didn't even allow polytheists to stay alive after paying Jizya (i.e. only Jews, Christians and Magians were allowed to live by paying Jizya)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quranic verse 9:29 testifies two issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, to wage a war against Jews and Christians was not due to the reason that they were fighting Muslims, but it was due to the reason that they didn’t believe in Allah and Muhammad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, Jizya was limited only to Jews and Christians. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.29&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Fight those people of the Book (Jews and Christians) who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, do not refrain from what has been prohibited by Allah and His Messenger and do not embrace the religion of truth (Al-Islam), until they pay Jizya (protection tax) with their own hands and feel themselves subdued.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Allah (i.e. Muhammad) limited Jizya only to the “People of the Book” (i.e. Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians) in this verse, while polytheists were not even allowed to live after paying the Jizya. &lt;strong&gt;Polytheists either had to accept Islam, or they would be killed after 4 months (or till the end of their covenant). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are traditions which are clear about how Muslims killed even peaceful polytheists after the revelation of this verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Book of Battles (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hadithurdu.com/01/1-2-1544/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Narrated Jarir: In the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance there was a house called Dhu-l-Khalasa or Al-Ka'ba Al-Yamaniya or Al-Ka'ba Ash-Shamiya. The Prophet said to me, &quot;Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l-Khalasa?&quot; So I set out with one-hundred-and-fifty riders, and we dismantled it and killed whoever was present there. Then I came to the Prophet and informed him, and he invoked good upon us and Al-Ahmas (tribe) .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musanif Ibn Abi Shaybah, 6/586, Kitab-ul-Hadood, chapter of في الزنادقة ما حدهم (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hadithportal.com/index.php?show=bab&amp;amp;bab_id=4412&amp;amp;chapter_id=24&amp;amp;book=62&amp;amp;sub_idBab=0&amp;amp;f=4245&amp;amp;e=4426&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Some people used to worship their idols secretly. They were arrested and brought to 4th caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib. He consulted the people how to punish them. People suggested to kill them. Ali said: No, I will not simply kill them, but I will do that act which was performed by them against my ancestor Abraham. After that Ali burnt all of them in the fire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disagreement among Muslim Scholars regarding the killing of ALL Polytheists after the death of Muhammad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Muslim Scholars agree that Muhammad didn't leave any polytheist to survive by paying Jizya. He compelled them either to accept Islam or to be slaughtered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;لم يختلف مسلمان في أن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - لم يقبل من الوثنيين من العرب إلا الإسلام أو السيف&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no difference among the Muslims that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not accept anything from the Arab idolators except Islam or the sword&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=DyUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ikhtilaf al-Fuqaha&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أجمعوا على أن رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم - أبى أخذ الجزية من عبدة الأوثان من العرب ولم يقبل منهم إلا الإسلام أو السيف&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is consensus that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ refused to accept Jizya from the idol worshipers from the Arabs and did not accept anything from them except Islam or the sword&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the disagreement occurred later among the opinions of 4 Sunni Imams: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (and present-day Salafists) all rule that except for Jews/Christians/Magians, all other non-Muslims (like Atheists, Buddhists, Hindus etc.) should be killed all over the world. They don't have any right to stay alive even after paying Jizya. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik said that the killing of all other non-Muslims was limited only to the Arab polytheists. But non-Arab polytheists can be allowed to stay alive by paying Jizya. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ٰIbn Kathir wrote under the commentary of verse &lt;a href=&quot;https://quran.com/9:29/tafsirs/ar-tafsir-ibn-kathir&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد استدل بهـذه الآية الكريمة من يرى أنه لا تؤخذ الجزية إلا من أهل الكتاب أو من أشباههم كالمجوس كما صح فيهم الحديث أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذها من مجوس هجر وهذا مذهب الشافعي وأحمد في المشهور عنه وقال أبو حنيفة رحمه الله: بل تؤخذ من جميع الأعاجم سواء كانوا من أهل الكتاب أو من المشركين ولا تؤخذ من العرب إلا من أهل الكتاب. وقال الإمام مالك: بل يجوز أن تضرب الجزية على جميع الكفار من كتابي ومجوسي ووثني وغير ذلك ولمأخذ هذه المذاهب&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;3:1-3:342&quot;&gt;This noble verse was cited as evidence by those who believe that the jizya (a tax paid by non-Muslims living in a Muslim-majority state) should only be collected from the People of the Book or from those who are similar to them, such as the Zoroastrians. This is the opinion of Imam al-Shafi'i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his most famous opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;5:1-5:217&quot;&gt;Abu Hanifa said: &quot;On the contrary, the jizya should be collected from all non-Arabs, whether they are People of the Book or polytheists. However, it should only be collected from Arabs if they are People of the Book.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos=&quot;7:1-7:165&quot;&gt;Imam Malik said: &quot;On the contrary, it is permissible to impose the jizya on all infidels, whether they are People of the Book, Zoroastrians, polytheists, or others.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ijma' (Consensus) of the Companions of Muhammad still allows killing all non-Arab non-Muslims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik gave a ruling that all non-Arab non-Muslims are allowed to stay alive by paying Jizya, but it goes against the direct consensus of the Companions of Muhammad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Umar Ibn Khattab conquered Persia, he used this same verse 9:5 as an argument to kill them, and all the Sahaba (companions) stayed quiet upon it and no one opposed Umar Ibn Khattab by telling him that this verse was limited to Polytheist of Mecca or Arabia only. Therefore, there was an IJMA (unanimous decision) by Sahaba upon this verse that it ordered the killing of all the Polytheists (even if they are non-Arabs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Umar Ibn Khattab didn’t kill the Persians while Ali and 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf told him that Magians of Persia were also counted as “People of the Book” by Prophet Muhammad. Thus, he took Jazya from them, and then he let them live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajr al-Asqallani recorded this Sahih (authentic) tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001053419/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=5744&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;وروى عبد بن حميد في تفسير سورة البروج بإسناد صحيح عن ابن أبزى &quot; لما هزم المسلمون أهل فارس قال عمر : اجتمعوا . فقال : إن المجوس ليسوا أهل كتاب فنضع عليهم ، ولا من عبدة الأوثان فنجري عليهم أحكامهم فقال علي : بل هم أهل كتاب &quot;’&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;When Muslims defeated the Persians, then Umar Ibn Khattab asked Sahaba (companions) to gather and to tell him what to do with the Persians as they are neither from the “People of Book” that they could take Jizya from them, and nor were they the polytheists that they should all be killed. Upon that Ali Ibn Abi Talib told him that Magians were also counted as “People of the Book”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Persians escaped the slaughter while they were also counted as the “People of the Book”, otherwise they would have also been killed as polytheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order to kill the polytheists was not limited to the era of Muhammad (but this order stays true even after his death).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And it was also not limited to only Arabia, but all non-Muslims of the whole world have to be killed by Muslims. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this “authentic” tradition of Sunan Abu Dawud (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001054259/http://dorar.net/h/0916f8e2ca3e8b9006f8ca7e4cf93e8c&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;لم يكن عمر يأخذ الجزية من المجوس حتى شهد عبد الرحمن بن عوف أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذها من مجوس هجر .&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab didn’t want to take Jizya (but wanted to kill them all), but 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf told him that Prophet Muhammad took Jizya from the Zoroastrians of the place of Hijr.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Present-day Salafis still consider that all polytheists of the whole world should be killed according to the order of verse 9:5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Grand Mufti Ibn Baaz wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001042634/http://www.binbaz.org.sa/node/277&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;، والأرجح أنه لا يلحق بهم غيرهم ، بل هؤلاء الطوائف الثلاث هم الذين يخيرون ؛ لأن الرسول قاتل الكفار في الجزيرة ولم يقبل منهم إلا الإسلام ، &lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;And the correct view is this that polytheists (of today) do not come under the category of “people of the book”, but only Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians are allowed to live by paying Jizya, while Prophet Muhammad killed all the polytheists in Arabia and accepted nothing from them, except Islam.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Salafi Fatwa Website for Muslims, i.e. Islam Question Answers wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34770/there-is-no-compulsion-to-accept-islam&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;Other scholars said that this (verse of No compulsion in the religion (Quran 2:256) applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad (Quran 9:5). So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people (of book) who may pay jizyah (i.e. Jews/Christian/Zoroastrians). The kuffaar (polytheists) should be compelled to enter Islam if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken, because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Other scholars said that this applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad. So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people who may pay jizyah.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood. Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allaah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential, because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not say, “if they pay the jizyah”. The Jews, Christians and Magians are to be asked to enter Islam; if they refuse then they should be asked to pay the jizyah. If they refuse to pay the jizyah then the Muslims must fight them if they are able to do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allaah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger  (Muhammad), (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:29]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted the jizyah from the Magians, but it was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) accepted the jizyah from anyone except the three groups mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #169179; background-color: #ecf0f1;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is why ISIS allowed the Christians of Iraq to pay Jizya and didn’t kill them. But ISIS didn’t accept any Jizya from the Yazidi community of Iraq, and they killed the Yazidi men and took all their women and children as slaves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Shafii, Hanbalis or Salafists of today form an Islamic State/Caliphate today, then again they will start killing all the polytheists and will not accept any Jizya from them. In this regard, there is no difference of opinion between ISIS and the Salafists (and all the followers of Imam Sahafii and Ahmed bin Hanbal). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic apologists: Verse 9:6 permits to give shelter to Polytheists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic apologists come up with this excuse today that verse 9:5 didn’t order the killing of all the polytheists, while verse 9:6 allows giving shelter to the polytheists too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excuse is wrong, verse 9:5 is about the polytheists who live within the boundaries of the Islamic State (Dar al-Salam, while verse 9:6 is only about such polytheists who come from the Non-Muslim States (Dar al-Kufr), and thus they have not heard the message of Islam earlier. Therefore, if such polytheists want to hear the message of Islam, then they can be given shelter for a short period temporarily. But after that temporary period, those polytheists should either accept Islam, or return to their respective non-Muslim State, and they are not allowed to permanently live in the Islamic State. According to Muslim Scholars, this temporary period could be from 4 months to one year maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;zxx&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=9&amp;amp;vid=6&quot;&gt;Quran 9:6&lt;/a&gt;) If any of the pagans ask you to give them refuge, give them asylum so that they may hear the words of God. Then, return them to their towns for they are ignorant people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir writes under the commentary of this verse 9:6 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=9&amp;amp;tAyahNo=6&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;والغرض أن من قدم من دار الحرب إلى دار الإسلام في أداء رسالة، أو تجارة، أو طلب صلح، أو مهادنة، أو حمل جزية، أو نحو ذلك من الأسباب، وطلب من الإمام أو نائبه أماناً، أعطي أماناً ما دام متردداً في دار الإسلام، وحتى يرجع إلى مأمنه ووطنه، لكن قال العلماء لا يجوز أن يمكن من الإقامة في دار الإسلام سنة، ويجوز أن يمكن من إقامة أربعة أشهر، وفيما بين ذلك فيما زاد على أربعة أشهر، ونقص عن سنة ، قولان عن الإمام الشافعي وغيره من العلماء رحمهم الله.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... those who come from a state of non-Muslims, to the area of Islam, delivering a message, for business transactions, to negotiate a peace treaty, to pay the Jizyah, to offer an end to hostilities, and so forth, and request safe passage from Muslim leaders or their deputies, should be granted safe passage, as long as they remain in Muslim areas, until they go back to their land and sanctuary. Scholars say that such a person should not be allowed to stay in Muslim area more than one year. He could stay for four months to one year, and there is a difference between the sayings of Imam Shafii etc. among the Scholars etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compulsion in Religion: Muhammad compelled the Polytheists to accept Islam or to be killed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamists decieve the world by claiming that there is no COIMPULSION in religion, but hide the fact that Muhammad himself compelled all Polytheists to convert to islam or to be killed. It happened when Muhammad got absolute power and feared no resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the revelation of verse of the Sword (Quran 9:5), Muhammad send all Arab polytheists a letter/message that after 4 months, either all Polytheists had to convert to Islam, or they would be killed, and they could not stay alive on their polytheism by paying Jizya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the excuse was made that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prophet invited the Arab Polytheists to Islam through a letter/message. In doing so, he made the &quot;Completion of Proof&quot; (Itmam al-Hujjah إتمام الحجة).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arab polytheists had the same Arabic language as the Quran. Thus they were able to understand the MESSAGE clearly. But despite that, when they deny to accept the messages, they deserved to be killed. The non-Arab polytheists didn't get this punishment, while they were not able to understand the message while their language is not Arabic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the existence of Allah has not been proven, yet Islamists have justified killing people in the name of Itmam al-Hujjah (The Completion of Proof) by Allah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows anyone to claim that they are a prophet of Allah, and by simply being present and delivering the message, they have completed the proof (Itmam al-Hujjah). If people do not believe, Allah will bring down punishment through the swords of his followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Allah were to send miraculous punishments such as storms, earthquakes, etc., on those who deny prophethood, it would still make sense because such natural disasters would be &quot;proof&quot; of Allah's existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the problem is that it has never been proven that Allah has sent any earthquake or punishment on a nation that denied prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These earthquakes and storms occur to Muslims who confirm prophethood just as they do to non-Muslims. Science has proven that these earthquakes are not due to miracles but occur in regions with fault lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the occurrence of these earthquakes and natural disasters is not proof of Allah's existence but evidence of Allah's &quot;non-existence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, Islamists make &quot;claims&quot; based on conjecture and then insist that this is a &quot;proof.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, understand that it is a contradiction in the Quran to say on one hand &quot;There is no compulsion in religion,&quot; and on the other hand, to force people to accept Islam by threatening punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human reason clearly guides that punishment should have only occurred when disbelievers were oppressing the Muslims (the Prophet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was not the case with the polytheists of Arabia. They were subjugated and in no way oppressing or killing Muslims or the Prophet. So, in this case, forcing them and threatening to kill them with the excuse of punishment to coerce them into accepting Islam is proof of contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the disbelievers were truly oppressing Muslims and the Prophet, Allah was absent, and there was no punishment of any kind (whether in the form of natural disasters or the sword).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If Umar ibn al-Khattab took 7 years to accept Islam, then how could illiterate and less intelligent Bedouin polytheists believe in just one letter/message?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophet Muhammad preached for 13 years in Mecca, but apart from a few people from his family, tribe, and the people of Mecca, no one believed, even though Muhammad was directly delivering the message to them. Even after the conquest of Mecca in 7 AH, the Quraysh did not believe. Muhammad bribed them and set stipends for them (Mu'allafatu al-Qulub Quran 9:60). But even then, they did not believe. Only after the verse of Sword (Quran 9:t) did they forcibly accept Islam. So, how can it be expected that illiterate and less intelligent Bedouin polytheists would believe in just one letter/message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Umar ibn al-Khattab received the message directly from Muhammad but did not believe for 7 years and was ready to kill Muhammad. So, how can it be expected that illiterate and less intelligent Bedouin polytheists would believe in just one letter/message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there were countless polytheists who, based on reasoning, completely rejected Muhammad's claim of prophethood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, your human reason will clearly guide you that if understanding the message was the issue, then the Jews and Christians should have understood Muhammad's message first. But isn't it strange that Jews and Christians are allowed to live by paying jizya, while illiterate Bedouin polytheists are to be killed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When Islam Was Weak, the Prophet's Job Was Only to &quot;Deliver the Message,&quot; Not to Compel, but When Islam Became Powerful, the Prophet's Job Was to &quot;Compel&quot; Too&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mecca and the early period in Medina, when Islam was weak and people were not accepting Muhammad's invitation, the Quran's narrative was that the Prophet's job was only to &quot;deliver the message,&quot; not to force it upon others because the Prophet is neither a guardian nor a keeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the following verses, all from the Meccan or early Medinan period when Islam was weak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O Prophet! Your duty is only to deliver the message, not to make them believe.&lt;/strong&gt; (An-Nahl 16:82)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prophet cannot compel anyone to guidance.&lt;/strong&gt; (28:56)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you force people to believe?&lt;/strong&gt; (10:99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prophet is not made a guardian over the people.&lt;/strong&gt; (17:54)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O Prophet, you are only a warner, and Allah has power over everything.&lt;/strong&gt; (Hud 11:12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your duty is to deliver the message, and it is Our duty to take account.&lt;/strong&gt; (Ar-Ra'd 13:40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are not appointed as a guardian over them; your duty is to deliver the message.&lt;/strong&gt; (Ash-Shura 42:48)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(The Prophets said) Our duty is only to deliver the message.&lt;/strong&gt; (Ya-Sin 36:17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Admonish, for your duty is only to admonish; you are not a keeper over them.&lt;/strong&gt; (Al-Ghashiyah 88:22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the early period in Medina, when Islam was weak, the verse came, &quot;There is no compulsion in religion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Islam became powerful in 9 AH and there was no one in Arabia to challenge Islam, Muhammad claimed the revelation of the verse of Qital, after which the Prophet's job now included forcibly making people accept the message and, in case of refusal, to carry out a massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't take the danger of Islam lightly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't let Islamic apologists fool you by presenting Islam as a harmless religion till the time they are weaker than you. &lt;/li&gt;

			<name>Lehrasap</name>
		</author>
		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is the verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.256&quot;&gt;2: 256&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;لَآ إِكْرَاهَ فِى ٱلدِّينِ (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;There is no compulsion in religion).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the context of this verse (as given by Ibn Kathir and Ibn Jarir).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2682&quot;&gt;Sunan Abi Dawud, 2682&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the children of a woman (in pre-Islamic days) did not survive, she took a vow on herself that if her child survives, she would convert it a Jew. When Banu an-Nadir were expelled (from Arabia), there were some children of the Ansar (Helpers) among them. They said: We shall not leave our children. So Allah the Exalted revealed; &quot;Let there be no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clear from error.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically the verse came for the non-muslim Jews, telling them to not force their religion (i.e. Judaism) on the sons of Ansar (who were Muslims). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as Muslims are concerned, then Muhammad gave only this order to kill any Muslim who changes his religion and leaves Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muhammad himself compelled polytheists to accept Islam, otherwise they should be killed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What more proof do we need about this compulsion, when Muhammad himself ordered to kill all polytheists who didn't accept Islam? He didn't even accept Jizya from polytheists (Jizya was allowed only for the people of the Book (i.e. Christians/Jews/Magians). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Wahidi recorded the following tradition under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=86&amp;amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;amp;tAyahNo=105&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=2&quot;&gt;commentary of verse 5:105&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn 'Abbas said: “The Messenger of Allah sent a letter to the people of Hajar, whose chief was Mundhir ibn Sawa, inviting them to Islam, or to pay the Jizyah if they chose not to embrace Islam. When Mundhir ibn Sawa received the letter, he showed it to the Arabs, Jews, Christians, Sabeans and Magians who were around him. They all agreed to pay the Jizyah and disliked embracing Islam. &lt;strong&gt;The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, wrote back to him, saying: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;'As for the Arabs, do not accept from them except Islam otherwise they will have nothing but the sword&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;As for the people of the Book and the Magians, accept the Jizyah from them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When this letter was read to them, the Arabs embraced Islam while the people of the Book and the Magians agreed to pay the Jizyah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest Islamic Fatwa website “Islam Question Answer” (which is run by Saudi Mufties) writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/34770&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/34770&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Question: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some friends say that whoever does not enter Islam, that is his choice and he should not be forced to become Muslim, quoting as evidence the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;br&gt;“And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you (O Muhammad) then compel mankind, until they become believers” &lt;br&gt;[Yoonus 10:99] &lt;br&gt;“There is no compulsion in religion” &lt;br&gt;[al-Baqarah 2:256] &lt;br&gt;What is your opinion concerning that?.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scholars explained that these two verses, and other similar verses, have to do with those from whom the jizyah may be taken (i.e. Ahle Kitaab), such as Jews, Christians and Magians (Zoroastrians). They are not to be forced, rather they are to be given the choice between becoming Muslim or paying the jizyah. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other scholars said that this applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or pay the jizyah if they are among the people who may pay jizyah (i.e. Ahle Kitaab). &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #006400;&quot;&gt;The kuffaar should be compelled to enter Islam if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (i.e. Ahle Kitaab), because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter ...&lt;br&gt;Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islamic calendar) have passed, then kill the Mushrikoon (see V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush. But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:5]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir writes in the commentary of verse 2:256 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=2&amp;amp;tAyahNo=256&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد ذهب طائفة كثيرة من العلماء، أن هذه محمولة على أهل الكتاب، ومن دخل في دينهم قبل النسخ والتبديل إذا بذلوا الجزية، وقال آخرون بل هي منسوخة بآية القتال، وإنه يجب أن يدعى جميع الأمم إلى الدخول في الدين الحنيف، دين الإسلام، فإن أبى أحد منهم الدخول فيه، ولم ينقد له، أو يبذل الجزية، قوتل حتى يقتل، وهذامعنى الإكراه، قال الله تعالى { سَتُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ أُوْلِى بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ تُقَـٰتِلُونَهُمْ أَوْ يُسْلِمُونَ } [الفتح: 16] وقال تعالى: { يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ جَـٰهِدِ ٱلْكُفَّـٰرَ وَٱلْمُنَـٰفِقِينَ وَٱغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ } [التوبة: 73] وقال تعالى: { يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَاتِلُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ يَلُونَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْكُفَّارِ وَلِيَجِدُواْ فِيكُمْ غِلْظَةً وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ }[التوبة: 123] وفي الصحيح: &quot; عجب ربك من قوم يقادون إلى الجنة في السلاسل &quot; يعني: الأسارى الذين يقدم بهم بلاد الإسلام في الوثائق والأغلال والقيود والأكبال، ثم بعد ذلك يسلمون، وتصلح أعمالهم وسرائرهم، فيكونون من أهل الجنة.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large number of Scholars are of opinion that this verse (2:256) &quot;There is no compulsion in religion&quot; was meant only for the People of Book (i.e. only Jews and Christians will not be compelled to accept Islam), but they have to pay Jizyya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #ffe000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While, other Scholars say that this verse of &quot;No Compulsion&quot; had been abrogated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (even for the People of Book) through the verse of sword (verse 9:5)&quot;...&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, all people of the world should be called to Islam. If anyone of them refuses to do so, or refuses to pay the Jizya they should be fought till they are killed.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the meaning of compulsion.&lt;br&gt;Allah says in verse 48:16;&quot;O Prophet, fight with them till the time they accept Islam.&quot;...&lt;br&gt;In the Sahih, the Prophet said: &quot;Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains&quot;, meaning prisoners brought in chains to the Islamic state, then they embrace Islam sincerely and become righteous, and are entered among the people of Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few more historical facts are as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The Verse of “No Compulsion in religion” was revealed in the initial period of Medina when Muslims were weak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Verse of Sword (i.e. Killing all the Mushrikeen) was revealed at the end of the 9th Hijri, when Muslims got full power and control and no power was left in Arabia to stop Muslims from using power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Thus, Muhammad killed all the Polytheists (Mushrikeen) in Arabia. This practice also continued during the era of Companions (Sahaba). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Then came Abu Hanifa, who was the first one who said it was only obligatory upon Prophet Muhammad to kill all the Mushrikeen, but now Muslims could also take Jizya from Polytheists and let them live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) But Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal and Imam Shafii and Imam Ibn Hazm contradicted this new fatwa of Abu Hanifa, while there was an Ijma of Companions (Sahaba) that Polytheists should be kept killing even after the death of Prophet Muhammad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani writes in his book “Fath-ul-Bari” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001053419/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=5744&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وروى عبد بن حميد في تفسير سورة البروج بإسناد صحيح عن ابن أبزى &quot; لما هزم المسلمون أهل فارس قال عمر : اجتمعوا . فقال : إن المجوس ليسوا أهل كتاب فنضع عليهم ، ولا من عبدة الأوثان فنجري عليهم أحكامهم فقال علي : بل هم أهل كتاب &quot;’&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;According to an &quot;authentic tradition&quot; when Muslims defeated the Persians, then Umar Ibn Khattab (the 2nd Caliph) collected the Companions (Sahaba) and asked them that Zoroastrians are neither from people of book (Ahl-e-Kitaab) that we take Jizya from them, nor are they from Polytheists that we kill them.&lt;br&gt;Upon that Ali Ibn Abi Talib (the 4th Caliph) witnessed that Zoroastrians are among the people of book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Saudi Mufti Albani graded this hadith of Sunan Abu Dawud as “authentic” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001054259/http://dorar.net/h/0916f8e2ca3e8b9006f8ca7e4cf93e8c&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;لم يكن عمر يأخذ الجزية من المجوس حتى شهد عبد الرحمن بن عوف أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذها من مجوس هجر .&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab didn't want to take Jizya money from Zoroastrians (but wanted to kill them as Polytheists), but companion Abdul Rehman bin Auf told him that Prophet Muhammad took Jizya money from Zoroastrians too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani also recorded the following “authentic” tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001053419/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=5744&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وروى أبو عبيد بإسناد صحيح عن حذيفة &quot; لولا أني رأيت أصحابي أخذوا الجزية من المجوس ما أخذتها &quot;&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;If my companions had not taken Jizya money from Zoroastrians, then I would have not taken it from them (but killed them as polytheists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6) If today any Islamic Caliphate is established from followers of Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (i.e. Salafies) or Imam Shafii, then once against this Islamic Caliphate is going to compel the Polytheists/Atheists to accept Islam or otherwise they will slaughter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this much to “No Compulsion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, compulsion is everywhere when a person is denied his basic human right and threatened to be killed if he leaves Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And compulsion is there when non-Muslims are not allowed to do Tableegh of their views and they will be killed if they do so.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is the verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/2.256&quot;&gt;2: 256&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;لَآ إِكْرَاهَ فِى ٱلدِّينِ (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;There is no compulsion in religion).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the context of this verse (as given by Ibn Kathir and Ibn Jarir).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2682&quot;&gt;Sunan Abi Dawud, 2682&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the children of a woman (in pre-Islamic days) did not survive, she took a vow on herself that if her child survives, she would convert it a Jew. When Banu an-Nadir were expelled (from Arabia), there were some children of the Ansar (Helpers) among them. They said: We shall not leave our children. So Allah the Exalted revealed; &quot;Let there be no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clear from error.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically the verse came for the non-muslim Jews, telling them to not force their religion (i.e. Judaism) on the sons of Ansar (who were Muslims). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as Muslims are concerned, then Muhammad gave only this order to kill any Muslim who changes his religion and leaves Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muhammad himself compelled polytheists to accept Islam, otherwise they should be killed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What more proof do we need about this compulsion, when Muhammad himself ordered to kill all polytheists who didn't accept Islam? He didn't even accept Jizya from polytheists (Jizya was allowed only for the people of the Book (i.e. Christians/Jews/Magians). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Wahidi recorded the following tradition under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=86&amp;amp;tSoraNo=5&amp;amp;tAyahNo=105&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=2&quot;&gt;commentary of verse 5:105&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn 'Abbas said: “The Messenger of Allah sent a letter to the people of Hajar, whose chief was Mundhir ibn Sawa, inviting them to Islam, or to pay the Jizyah if they chose not to embrace Islam. When Mundhir ibn Sawa received the letter, he showed it to the Arabs, Jews, Christians, Sabeans and Magians who were around him.

When this letter was read to them, the Arabs embraced Islam while the people of the Book and the Magians agreed to pay the Jizyah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;لم يكن عمر يأخذ الجزية من المجوس حتى شهد عبد الرحمن بن عوف أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أخذها من مجوس هجر .&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;Umar Ibn Khattab didn't want to take Jizya money from Zoroastrians (but wanted to kill them as Polytheists), but companion Abdul Rehman bin Auf told him that Prophet Muhammad took Jizya money from Zoroastrians too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani also recorded the following “authentic” tradition (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20151001053419/http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?flag=1&amp;amp;bk_no=52&amp;amp;ID=5744&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وروى أبو عبيد بإسناد صحيح عن حذيفة &quot; لولا أني رأيت أصحابي أخذوا الجزية من المجوس ما أخذتها &quot;&lt;br&gt;Translation:&lt;br&gt;If my companions had not taken Jizya money from Zoroastrians, then I would have not taken it from them (but killed them as polytheists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6) If today any Islamic Caliphate is established from followers of Imam Ahmed bin Hanbal (i.e. Salafies) or Imam Shafii, then once against this Islamic Caliphate is going to compel the Polytheists/Atheists to accept Islam or otherwise they will slaughter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this much to “No Compulsion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, compulsion is everywhere when a person is denied his basic human right and threatened to be killed if he leaves Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And compulsion is there when non-Muslims are not allowed to do Tableegh of their views and they will be killed if they do so.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today Muslims deceive by saying that Jihad is only allowed in &quot;self-defense&quot;. They quote &quot;&lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; this verse of Quran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 2:190) Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Muslims don't tell you is this that this verse (2:190) was revealed during the &quot;earlier&quot; period of Madinian life (i.e. 2 or 3 Hijri year), &lt;strong&gt;when Muslims were weak&lt;/strong&gt; and it was not possible for them to go to Mecca and directly attack Kuffar (polytheists). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Muslims grew stronger, then offensive verses started revealing. And in the 9th Hijri year, when Muslims had already conquered Mecca &lt;strong&gt;and got absolute power&lt;/strong&gt;, then the following Verses of Surah Tauba were revealed, which gave the &quot;Licence to fight and kill&quot; the Kuffar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 9:5) So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licence for fighting against the &quot;people of the scripture (i.e. Jews and Christians)&quot; was also given in this last Surah, but with one exception that they could pay the Jizya (i.e. tax) and save their life without accepting Islam. But polytheists were not given the option of the Jizya tax. They had either to accept Islam or be killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 9:29) Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) &lt;strong&gt;from those who were given the Scripture (i.e. Jews/Christians), fight them till they [agree to] pay the exemption tax with a willing hand, after having been humiliated [in war].&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, these 2 verses of Surah Tauba were the final Orders of offensive Jihad, which were never abrogated. Today, Muslims hide these 2 verses and deny this &quot;offensive Jihad&quot;. They are indeed dishonest.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If violent Jihad should only be pursued in self-defence, what was the justification for the early Muslim conquests of the Middle East, North Africa and Spain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bin Baz&quot; is the &quot;Grand Mufti&quot; of Saudi Arabia. In his book &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;ms-RightMenutitlearealine&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;ctl00_RedirectContronl1_lblTitle&quot;&gt;Fatwas of Ibn Baz&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, volume 18, he writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180729012121/https://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/chain/en_Majmoo_alFatawa_IbnBaz/en_03_Majmoo_alFatawa_IbnBaz.pdf&quot;&gt;Online link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jihad is divided into two kinds;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Jihad for making conquests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Jihad for self-defense, and both of them aim at conveying Allah's Religion, inviting people to it, taking people from darkness to the light, making Allah's Religion prevail in His Land and making (all and every kind of) worship for Allah (Alone)...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says in Surat Al-Anfal:  &lt;strong&gt;And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allâh) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allâh Alone [in the whole of the world]&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says in Surat Al-Tawbah:  Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islâmic calendar) have passed, &lt;strong&gt;then kill the Mushrikûn (See V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, it was reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of&lt;span id=&quot;ContentParagraph&quot; class=&quot;HarfBody&quot;&gt; Abu Hurayrah &lt;/span&gt;(may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &lt;strong&gt;I have been ordered to fight against the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is Allah's Messenger, so if they perform all that, then they save their lives and property from me except for Islamic laws, and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many Hadiths in this regard. These noble Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) and authentic Hadiths indicate clearly that it is obligatory to perform Jihad against disbelievers and atheists, fight them, invite to Islam and fight them because they insist on disbelief and do so till they worship none but Allah and believe in His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) and follow his commands knowing that unless they do so their blood and money will not be inviolable. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This includes Jihad for conquest and self-defense; with no exception&lt;/strong&gt; but for those who abide by the Jizyah (poll tax required from non-Muslims living in an Islamic state) and its conditions as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allâh, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allâh and His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islâm) &lt;strong&gt;among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)&lt;/strong&gt;, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued ... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For others (i.e. others than people of scripture, means Kuffar), they should be fought till they embrace Islam as according to the sound of the two opinions held by scholars in this regard. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prophet (peace be upon him) fought the Arab till they embraced Islam in crowds (groups after groups) and he did not ask them (i.e. Kuffar) to pay Jizyah&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Three Stages of Jihad in Islam:&lt;br&gt;━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three Stages of Jihad in Islam were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage: to let Muslims perform Jihad, but without obligation as Allah (Glorified be He) says: &lt;a id=&quot;ContentAnchor&quot; class=&quot;Mofty&quot; title=&quot;Surah Al-Hajj, 22: 39&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; name=&quot;Permissiontofight(againstdisbelievers)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allâh is Able to give them (believers) victory &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second stage is asking Muslims to fight those who fight them and abstain from whoever abstains from fighting them. In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) revealed this saying ...: &lt;a id=&quot;ContentAnchor&quot; class=&quot;Mofty&quot; title=&quot;Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 190&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; name=&quot;AndfightintheWayofAll%C3%A2hthose&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And fight in the Way of Allâh those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allâh likes not the transgressors...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third stage is to fight disbelievers and invade them in their lands so as to prevent Fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah) and ensure that worship is for Allah (Alone) so that good will prevail everywhere, Islam will spread, those who invite to disbelief will be eradicated and people will enjoy judgment by the fair Islamic Shari`ah and its fair teachings...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And Allah says in Quran) &lt;strong&gt;Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islâmic calendar) have passed, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;then kill the Mushrikûn (See V.2:105) wherever you find them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in Surat Al-Anfal: &lt;strong&gt;And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allâh) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allâh Alone [in the whole of the world]&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some scholars viewed that the second stage that is represented in fighting those who fight Muslims, and abstaining from whoever abstains from fighting Muslims, was canceled as it was only practiced when the Muslims were weak&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;but after Allah (Exalted be He) made them strong and multiplied their number and resources, they were asked to fight whoever fights or whoever does not fight them so that the religion (worship) will all be for Allah alone and to pay Jizyah if they have to do that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other scholars see that the second stage was not cancelled and it can be applied in case of necessity. When Muslims become strong and are able to start fighting their enemies and perform Jihad in the cause of Allah, they have to do so, according the Ayah of Surat Al-Tawbah and its related meanings. But if they are not able to do so, they have only to fight whoever fights them or raises aggression on them and abstain from fighting whoever abstains from fighting them. This is according to the Ayah of Surat An-Nisa'&lt;/strong&gt;. This viewpoint is sounder and worthier of acceptance than the viewpoint that says that this stage was abrogated. This viewpoint was chosen also by&lt;span id=&quot;ContentParagraph&quot; class=&quot;HarfBody&quot;&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah &lt;/span&gt;(may Allah be merciful to him).&lt;strong&gt; Therefore, everyone who has the least amount of knowledge should know that modern writers or others who say that Jihad is only permissible for the purpose of defense is mistaken.&lt;/strong&gt; The above-mentioned evidence is contrary to this saying and the correct way is what we mentioned as indicated by trustworthy scholars. Anyone who contemplates the biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in fighting against Mushriks (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) will know that what we said accords with the above-mentioned Ayahs and Hadiths. May Allah guide us all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there should be no more doubts after this clear Fatwa of Bin Baz and Ibn Taymiyyah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is not limited to Saudia and Ibn Taymiyyah only, but let us see what esteemed Hanafi Jurist Imam al-&lt;b&gt;Sarakhsi &lt;/b&gt;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the majority of Scholars (Arabic &quot;Jamhoor جمھور&quot;) it is not necessary to start Jihad only when Kuffar initiate it as a provocation, but if any non-Muslim state does not have any aggressive aims against any Muslim State, still it is &quot;obligatory&quot; for Muslims to fight against them. &lt;br&gt;Reference: Imam al-Sarakhsi, Sharah al-Kabir, volume 1, page 188 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161215084922/http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles_urdu/view/Ahkaam-e-Qataal-11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Hanafi Jurist, Imam al-Hammam writes in his book &quot;Fath-ul-Qadeer&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161215084922/http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles_urdu/view/Ahkaam-e-Qataal-11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقتال الکفار ... واجب وان لم یبدء ونا لان الادلۃ الموجبۃ لہ لم تقید الوجوب ببداء تہم....فتح القدیر ۱۲/۳۸۵&lt;br&gt;It is obligatory to attack the Kuffar, even if they don't fight against us, while there is no condition which says that war could only be fought against them when they first attack us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another esteemed Hanbali jurist Ibn Qudamah wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161215084922/http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles_urdu/view/Ahkaam-e-Qataal-11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Muslims are weak and not in position to wage a war against the Kuffar, then in this case they are allowed to make a peace pact with them. Nevertheless, this pack should only be of short duration, while in case of permanent agreement, Muslims have to give up the orders of Jihad permanently. Some Scholars say that it is not allowed to make a peace agreement more than 4 months. (Reference: Book Al-Mughani by Ibn Qudamah, volume 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam al-Sarakhsi added to it (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161215084922/http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles_urdu/view/Ahkaam-e-Qataal-11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peace agreement with Kuffar will only be maintained till the time Muslim need it such as they don't have sufficient war power. But as soon as this situation changes, then it is obligatory to end this peace agreement and to wage Jihad against the Kuffar. (Reference: Al-Mubsoot by Imam al-Sarakhsi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Verse of &quot;No Compulsion in Religion&quot; has been abrogated:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be seen as innocent, Muslims also quote very often the verse of &quot;There is No Compulsion in religion&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 2:256) There is no compulsion in religion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again Muslims don't tell the complete Truth, which is as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, this verse was revealed in the initial Madinian period (2 or 3 Hijri year). While final Verses of &quot;offensive Jihad&quot; were revealed later in Surah Tauba, when Muslims had already got power. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many Islamic Scholars believe that &quot;No Compulsion&quot; in this verse is referring only to the &quot;People of Book&quot; i.e. Jews/Christians will not be compelled to change their religion by paying Jizya (tax money) and feel subdued and humiliated (Verse 9:29). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While some scholars say that this verse of &quot;No compulsion&quot; has been &quot;ABROGATED&quot; by the verse of sword (Verse 9:05)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir writes in the commentary of verse 2:256 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=2&amp;amp;tAyahNo=256&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد ذهب طائفة كثيرة من العلماء، أن هذه محمولة على أهل الكتاب، ومن دخل في دينهم قبل النسخ والتبديل إذا بذلوا الجزية، وقال آخرون بل هي منسوخة بآية القتال، وإنه يجب أن يدعى جميع الأمم إلى الدخول في الدين الحنيف، دين الإسلام، فإن أبى أحد منهم الدخول فيه، ولم ينقد له، أو يبذل الجزية، قوتل حتى يقتل، وهذامعنى الإكراه، قال الله تعالى { سَتُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ أُوْلِى بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ تُقَـٰتِلُونَهُمْ أَوْ يُسْلِمُونَ } [الفتح: 16] وقال تعالى: { يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ جَـٰهِدِ ٱلْكُفَّـٰرَ وَٱلْمُنَـٰفِقِينَ وَٱغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ } [التوبة: 73] وقال تعالى: { يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَاتِلُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ يَلُونَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْكُفَّارِ وَلِيَجِدُواْ فِيكُمْ غِلْظَةً وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ }[التوبة: 123] وفي الصحيح: &quot; عجب ربك من قوم يقادون إلى الجنة في السلاسل &quot; يعني: الأسارى الذين يقدم بهم بلاد الإسلام في الوثائق والأغلال والقيود والأكبال، ثم بعد ذلك يسلمون، وتصلح أعمالهم وسرائرهم، فيكونون من أهل الجنة.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large number of Scholars are of opinion that this verse (2:256) &quot;There is no compulsion in religion&quot; was meant only for the People of Book (i.e. only Jews and Christians will not be compelled to accept Islam), but they have to pay Jizyya. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While, other Scholars say that this verse of &quot;No Compulsion&quot; had been abrogated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (even for the People of Book) through the verse of sword (verse 9:5)&quot;...&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, all people of the world should be called to Islam. If anyone of them refuses to do so, or refuses to pay the Jizya they should be fought till they are killed.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the meaning of compulsion. &lt;br&gt;Allah says in verse 48:16;&quot;O Prophet, fight with them till the time they accept Islam.&quot;... &lt;br&gt;In the Sahih, the Prophet said: &quot;Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains&quot;, meaning prisoners brought in chains to the Islamic state, then they embrace Islam sincerely and become righteous, and are entered among the people of Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note, you will not find this part of Tafsir Ibn Kathir in the English Translation. It is due to the reason that Muslims have deliberately not translated the full Tafsir Ibn Kathir, and they intentionally removed those parts from the English translation, which could expose the real face of Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the largest Muslim Fatwa website &quot;Islam Question Answer&quot; writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/34770&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scholars explained that these two verses (i.e. the verse of No Compulsion) and other similar verses, have to do (only) with those from whom the jizyah may be taken, such as Jews, Christians and Magians (Zoroastrians). They are not to be forced, rather they are to be given the choice between becoming Muslim or paying the jizyah . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other scholars said that this applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad. So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people who may pay jizyah. The kuffaar should be compelled to enter Islam if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken&lt;/strong&gt;, because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood. Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, &lt;strong&gt;so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allaah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential, because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.&lt;/strong&gt; This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, &lt;strong&gt;because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim (otherwise he killed them).&lt;/strong&gt; And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:5]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not say, “if they pay the jizyah”. The Jews, Christians and Magians are to be asked to enter Islam; if they refuse then they should be asked to pay the jizyah. If they refuse to pay the jizyah then the Muslims must fight them if they are able to do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allaah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger  (Muhammad), (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:29]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted the jizyah from the Magians, but it was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) accepted the jizyah from anyone except the three groups mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic principle concerning that is the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allaah), and the religion (worship) will all be for Allaah Alone [in the whole of the world]”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[al-Anfaal 8:39] &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islamic calendar) have passed, then kill the Mushrikoon (see V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush. But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:5]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is known as Ayat al-Sayf (the verse of the sword). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These and similar verses abrogate the verses which say that there is no compulsion to become Muslim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Allaah is the Source of strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muhammad himself waged offensive Wars against the polytheists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Muslim, Book of Jihad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/32/1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) and Sahih Bukhari, Book of Manumission (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/49/25&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn 'Aun reported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;I wrote to Nafi' inquiring from him whether it was necessary to extend (to the disbelievers) an invitation to accept (Islam) before meeting them in fight. He wrote (in reply) to me that&lt;strong&gt; it was necessary (only) in the early days of Islam&lt;/strong&gt;. The Messenger of Allah made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq &lt;strong&gt;while they were unaware&lt;/strong&gt; and their cattle were having a drink at the water. &lt;strong&gt;He killed those who fought and imprisoned others&lt;/strong&gt;. On that very day, he captured Juwairiya bint al-Harith. Nafi' said that this tradition was related to him by Abdullah b. Umar who (himself) was among the raiding troops.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Muslims used to give a time of 3 days to the opponents to accept Islam, but later they even didn't invite the people towards Islam, but directly attacked them in order to get the spoils of war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Muslims will get the power, they will, without doubt, repeat the &quot;Sunnah&quot; (holy practice) of their prophet and they will wage the offensive Jihad in order to forcefully convert people towards Islam. The Sooner the rest of the world understands it, the better it would be for humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sachaai.com/03/images/Images/jihad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today Muslims deceive by saying that Jihad is only allowed in &quot;self-defense&quot;. They quote &quot;&lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; this verse of Quran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 2:190) Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Muslims don't tell you is this that this verse (2:190) was revealed during the &quot;earlier&quot; period of Madinian life (i.e. 2 or 3 Hijri year), &lt;strong&gt;when Muslims were weak&lt;/strong&gt; and it was not possible for them to go to Mecca and directly attack Kuffar (polytheists). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Muslims grew stronger, then offensive verses started revealing. And in the 9th Hijri year, when Muslims had already conquered Mecca &lt;strong&gt;and got absolute power&lt;/strong&gt;, then the following Verses of Surah Tauba were revealed, which gave the &quot;Licence to fight and kill&quot; the Kuffar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 9:5) So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licence for fighting against the &quot;people of the scripture (i.e. Jews and Christians)&quot; was also given in this last Surah, but with one exception that they could pay the Jizya (i.e. tax) and save their life without accepting Islam. But polytheists were not given the option of the Jizya tax. They had either to accept Islam or be killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 9:29) Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) &lt;strong&gt;from those who were given the Scripture (i.e. Jews/Christians), fight them till they [agree to] pay the exemption tax with a willing hand, after having been humiliated [in war].&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, these 2 verses of Surah Tauba were the final Orders of offensive Jihad, which were never abrogated. Today, Muslims hide these 2 verses and deny this &quot;offensive Jihad&quot;. They are indeed dishonest.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If violent Jihad should only be pursued in self-defence, what was the justification for the early Muslim conquests of the Middle East, North Africa and Spain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bin Baz&quot; is the &quot;Grand Mufti&quot; of Saudi Arabia. In his book &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;ms-RightMenutitlearealine&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;ctl00_RedirectContronl1_lblTitle&quot;&gt;Fatwas of Ibn Baz&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, volume 18, he writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180729012121/https://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/chain/en_Majmoo_alFatawa_IbnBaz/en_03_Majmoo_alFatawa_IbnBaz.pdf&quot;&gt;Online link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jihad is divided into two kinds;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Jihad for making conquests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Jihad for self-defense, and both of them aim at conveying Allah's Religion, inviting people to it, taking people from darkness to the light, making Allah's Religion prevail in His Land and making (all and every kind of) worship for Allah (Alone)...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says in Surat Al-Anfal:  &lt;strong&gt;And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allâh) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allâh Alone [in the whole of the world]&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says in Surat Al-Tawbah:  Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islâmic calendar) have passed, &lt;strong&gt;then kill the Mushrikûn (See V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, it was reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of&lt;span id=&quot;ContentParagraph&quot; class=&quot;HarfBody&quot;&gt; Abu Hurayrah &lt;/span&gt;(may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &lt;strong&gt;I have been ordered to fight against the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is Allah's Messenger, so if they perform all that, then they save their lives and property from me except for Islamic laws, and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many Hadiths in this regard. These noble Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) and authentic Hadiths indicate clearly that it is obligatory to perform Jihad against disbelievers and atheists, fight them, invite to Islam and fight them because they insist on disbelief and do so till they worship none but Allah and believe in His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) and follow his commands knowing that unless they do so their blood and money will not be inviolable. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This includes Jihad for conquest and self-defense; with no exception&lt;/strong&gt; but for those who abide by the Jizyah (poll tax required from non-Muslims living in an Islamic state) and its conditions as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allâh, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allâh and His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islâm) &lt;strong&gt;among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)&lt;/strong&gt;, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued ... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For others (i.e. others than people of scripture, means Kuffar), they should be fought till they embrace Islam as according to the sound of the two opinions held by scholars in this regard. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prophet (peace be upon him) fought the Arab till they embraced Islam in crowds (groups after groups) and he did not ask them (i.e. Kuffar) to pay Jizyah&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Three Stages of Jihad in Islam:&lt;br&gt;━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three Stages of Jihad in Islam were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage: to let Muslims perform Jihad, but without obligation as Allah (Glorified be He) says: &lt;a id=&quot;ContentAnchor&quot; class=&quot;Mofty&quot; title=&quot;Surah Al-Hajj, 22: 39&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; name=&quot;Permissiontofight(againstdisbelievers)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allâh is Able to give them (believers) victory &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second stage is asking Muslims to fight those who fight them and abstain from whoever abstains from fighting them. In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) revealed this saying ...: &lt;a id=&quot;ContentAnchor&quot; class=&quot;Mofty&quot; title=&quot;Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 190&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; name=&quot;AndfightintheWayofAll%C3%A2hthose&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And fight in the Way of Allâh those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allâh likes not the transgressors...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third stage is to fight disbelievers and invade them in their lands so as to prevent Fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah) and ensure that worship is for Allah (Alone) so that good will prevail everywhere, Islam will spread, those who invite to disbelief will be eradicated and people will enjoy judgment by the fair Islamic Shari`ah and its fair teachings...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And Allah says in Quran) &lt;strong&gt;Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islâmic calendar) have passed, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;then kill the Mushrikûn (See V.2:105) wherever you find them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in Surat Al-Anfal: &lt;strong&gt;And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allâh) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allâh Alone [in the whole of the world]&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some scholars viewed that the second stage that is represented in fighting those who fight Muslims, and abstaining from whoever abstains from fighting Muslims, was canceled as it was only practiced when the Muslims were weak&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;but after Allah (Exalted be He) made them strong and multiplied their number and resources, they were asked to fight whoever fights or whoever does not fight them so that the religion (worship) will all be for Allah alone and to pay Jizyah if they have to do that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other scholars see that the second stage was not cancelled and it can be applied in case of necessity. When Muslims become strong and are able to start fighting their enemies and perform Jihad in the cause of Allah, they have to do so, according the Ayah of Surat Al-Tawbah and its related meanings. But if they are not able to do so, they have only to fight whoever fights them or raises aggression on them and abstain from fighting whoever abstains from fighting them. This is according to the Ayah of Surat An-Nisa'&lt;/strong&gt;. This viewpoint is sounder and worthier of acceptance than the viewpoint that says that this stage was abrogated. This viewpoint was chosen also by&lt;span id=&quot;ContentParagraph&quot; class=&quot;HarfBody&quot;&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah &lt;/span&gt;(may Allah be merciful to him).&lt;strong&gt; Therefore, everyone who has the least amount of knowledge should know that modern writers or others who say that Jihad is only permissible for the purpose of defense is mistaken.&lt;/strong&gt; The above-mentioned evidence is contrary to this saying and the correct way is what we mentioned as indicated by trustworthy scholars. Anyone who contemplates the biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in fighting against Mushriks (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) will know that what we said accords with the above-mentioned Ayahs and Hadiths. May Allah guide us all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there should be no more doubts after this clear Fatwa of Bin Baz and Ibn Taymiyyah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is not limited to Saudia and Ibn Taymiyyah only, but let us see what esteemed Hanafi Jurist Imam al-&lt;b&gt;Sarakhsi &lt;/b&gt;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the majority of Scholars (Arabic &quot;Jamhoor جمھور&quot;) it is not necessary to start Jihad only when Kuffar initiate it as a provocation, but if any non-Muslim state does not have any aggressive aims against any Muslim State, still it is &quot;obligatory&quot; for Muslims to fight against them. &lt;br&gt;Reference: Imam al-Sarakhsi, Sharah al-Kabir, volume 1, page 188 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161215084922/http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles_urdu/view/Ahkaam-e-Qataal-11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Hanafi Jurist, Imam al-Hammam writes in his book &quot;Fath-ul-Qadeer&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161215084922/http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles_urdu/view/Ahkaam-e-Qataal-11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقتال الکفار ... واجب وان لم یبدء ونا لان الادلۃ الموجبۃ لہ لم تقید الوجوب ببداء تہم....فتح القدیر ۱۲/۳۸۵&lt;br&gt;It is obligatory to attack the Kuffar, even if they don't fight against us, while there is no condition which says that war could only be fought against them when they first attack us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another esteemed Hanbali jurist Ibn Qudamah wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161215084922/http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles_urdu/view/Ahkaam-e-Qataal-11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Muslims are weak and not in position to wage a war against the Kuffar, then in this case they are allowed to make a peace pact with them. Nevertheless, this pack should only be of short duration, while in case of permanent agreement, Muslims have to give up the orders of Jihad permanently. Some Scholars say that it is not allowed to make a peace agreement more than 4 months. (Reference: Book Al-Mughani by Ibn Qudamah, volume 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam al-Sarakhsi added to it (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20161215084922/http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles_urdu/view/Ahkaam-e-Qataal-11&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peace agreement with Kuffar will only be maintained till the time Muslim need it such as they don't have sufficient war power. But as soon as this situation changes, then it is obligatory to end this peace agreement and to wage Jihad against the Kuffar. (Reference: Al-Mubsoot by Imam al-Sarakhsi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Verse of &quot;No Compulsion in Religion&quot; has been abrogated:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be seen as innocent, Muslims also quote very often the verse of &quot;There is No Compulsion in religion&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Quran 2:256) There is no compulsion in religion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again Muslims don't tell the complete Truth, which is as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, this verse was revealed in the initial Madinian period (2 or 3 Hijri year). While final Verses of &quot;offensive Jihad&quot; were revealed later in Surah Tauba, when Muslims had already got power. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many Islamic Scholars believe that &quot;No Compulsion&quot; in this verse is referring only to the &quot;People of Book&quot; i.e. Jews/Christians will not be compelled to change their religion by paying Jizya (tax money) and feel subdued and humiliated (Verse 9:29). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While some scholars say that this verse of &quot;No compulsion&quot; has been &quot;ABROGATED&quot; by the verse of sword (Verse 9:05)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir writes in the commentary of verse 2:256 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&amp;amp;tTafsirNo=7&amp;amp;tSoraNo=2&amp;amp;tAyahNo=256&amp;amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;amp;UserProfile=0&amp;amp;LanguageId=1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وقد ذهب طائفة كثيرة من العلماء، أن هذه محمولة على أهل الكتاب، ومن دخل في دينهم قبل النسخ والتبديل إذا بذلوا الجزية، وقال آخرون بل هي منسوخة بآية القتال، وإنه يجب أن يدعى جميع الأمم إلى الدخول في الدين الحنيف، دين الإسلام، فإن أبى أحد منهم الدخول فيه، ولم ينقد له، أو يبذل الجزية، قوتل حتى يقتل، وهذامعنى الإكراه، قال الله تعالى { سَتُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ أُوْلِى بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ تُقَـٰتِلُونَهُمْ أَوْ يُسْلِمُونَ } [الفتح: 16] وقال تعالى: { يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِىُّ جَـٰهِدِ ٱلْكُفَّـٰرَ وَٱلْمُنَـٰفِقِينَ وَٱغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ } [التوبة: 73] وقال تعالى: { يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَاتِلُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ يَلُونَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْكُفَّارِ وَلِيَجِدُواْ فِيكُمْ غِلْظَةً وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ }[التوبة: 123] وفي الصحيح: &quot; عجب ربك من قوم يقادون إلى الجنة في السلاسل &quot; يعني: الأسارى الذين يقدم بهم بلاد الإسلام في الوثائق والأغلال والقيود والأكبال، ثم بعد ذلك يسلمون، وتصلح أعمالهم وسرائرهم، فيكونون من أهل الجنة.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large number of Scholars are of opinion that this verse (2:256) &quot;There is no compulsion in religion&quot; was meant only for the People of Book (i.e. only Jews and Christians will not be compelled to accept Islam), but they have to pay Jizyya. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While, other Scholars say that this verse of &quot;No Compulsion&quot; had been abrogated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (even for the People of Book) through the verse of sword (verse 9:5)&quot;...&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, all people of the world should be called to Islam. If anyone of them refuses to do so, or refuses to pay the Jizya they should be fought till they are killed.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the meaning of compulsion. &lt;br&gt;Allah says in verse 48:16;&quot;O Prophet, fight with them till the time they accept Islam.&quot;... &lt;br&gt;In the Sahih, the Prophet said: &quot;Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains&quot;, meaning prisoners brought in chains to the Islamic state, then they embrace Islam sincerely and become righteous, and are entered among the people of Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note, you will not find this part of Tafsir Ibn Kathir in the English Translation. It is due to the reason that Muslims have deliberately not translated the full Tafsir Ibn Kathir, and they intentionally removed those parts from the English translation, which could expose the real face of Islam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the largest Muslim Fatwa website &quot;Islam Question Answer&quot; writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://islamqa.info/en/34770&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scholars explained that these two verses (i.e. the verse of No Compulsion) and other similar verses, have to do (only) with those from whom the jizyah may be taken, such as Jews, Christians and Magians (Zoroastrians). They are not to be forced, rather they are to be given the choice between becoming Muslim or paying the jizyah . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other scholars said that this applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allaah’s command to fight and wage jihad. So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people who may pay jizyah. The kuffaar should be compelled to enter Islam if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken&lt;/strong&gt;, because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood. Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, &lt;strong&gt;so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allaah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential, because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.&lt;/strong&gt; This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, &lt;strong&gt;because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim (otherwise he killed them).&lt;/strong&gt; And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:5]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not say, “if they pay the jizyah”. The Jews, Christians and Magians are to be asked to enter Islam; if they refuse then they should be asked to pay the jizyah. If they refuse to pay the jizyah then the Muslims must fight them if they are able to do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allaah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger  (Muhammad), (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:29]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted the jizyah from the Magians, but it was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) accepted the jizyah from anyone except the three groups mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic principle concerning that is the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allaah), and the religion (worship) will all be for Allaah Alone [in the whole of the world]”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[al-Anfaal 8:39] &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islamic calendar) have passed, then kill the Mushrikoon (see V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush. But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[al-Tawbah 9:5]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is known as Ayat al-Sayf (the verse of the sword). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These and similar verses abrogate the verses which say that there is no compulsion to become Muslim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Allaah is the Source of strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muhammad himself waged offensive Wars against the polytheists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahih Muslim, Book of Jihad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/32/1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) and Sahih Bukhari, Book of Manumission (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/bukhari/49/25&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn 'Aun reported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_details&quot;&gt;I wrote to Nafi' inquiring from him whether it was necessary to extend (to the disbelievers) an invitation to accept (Islam) before meeting them in fight. He wrote (in reply) to me that&lt;strong&gt; it was necessary (only) in the early days of Islam&lt;/strong&gt;. The Messenger of Allah made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq &lt;strong&gt;while they were unaware&lt;/strong&gt; and their cattle were having a drink at the water. &lt;strong&gt;He killed those who fought and imprisoned others&lt;/strong&gt;. On that very day, he captured Juwairiya bint al-Harith. Nafi' said that this tradition was related to him by Abdullah b. Umar who (himself) was among the raiding troops.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Muslims used to give a time of 3 days to the opponents to accept Islam, but later they even didn't invite the people towards Islam, but directly attacked them in order to get the spoils of war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Muslims will get the power, they will, without doubt, repeat the &quot;Sunnah&quot; (holy practice) of their prophet and they will wage the offensive Jihad in order to forcefully convert people towards Islam. The Sooner the rest of the world understands it, the better it would be for humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At maximum, people think that Muslims are not allowed to wish them on their non-Muslim festivals. Unfortunately, the situation is much more dangerous than this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharia Teachings are following this pathway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;* Non-Muslim festivals are Evil and they are from Devil/Satan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;* Not only Muslims are not allowed to wish the non-Muslims, but also Muslims have to keep &quot;hatred&quot; against non-Muslim festivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;* And in the last stage, when Muslims get enough power, then they should by force prohibit the non-Muslims from openly celebrating their festivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Saudi Salafi Fatwa website writes (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170824010629/https://islamqa.info/en/106668&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greeting Christians on the occasion of their festivals: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is forbidden with regard to congratulating the Christians on the occasion of their festivals is&lt;strong&gt; expressing joy to them, being overly polite and showing approval of their actions, even if that is only expressed outwardly without feeling it inwardly&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prohibition concerns those who show any kind of participation or approval, such as giving gifts,&lt;strong&gt; verbal greetings (i.e. saying merry Christmas)&lt;/strong&gt;, taking time off work, making food, going to places of leisure, and other customs of celebration. Having any intention other than what is said (when congratulating them) does not make it permissible. The outward appearance of these actions is sufficient to say that it is prohibited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that most of those who take a lenient attitude towards such matters do not intend to join the Christians in their shirk; rather what motivates them in some cases is showing politeness, and in other cases it is shyness, but politeness with regard to falsehood is not permissible; &lt;strong&gt;rather what is required is to denounce the evil and strive to change it&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact some of the (early) scholars are of the view that &lt;strong&gt;the one who does these things is a kaafir&lt;/strong&gt;, because it involves venerating the symbols of kufr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahabi (companion) ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas said: The one who follows the tradition of non-Muslims and observes their Nawrooz and Mahrajaan (festivals), and imitates them until he dies like that, will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(There is an Ijma' that) Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, the Sahaabah and all the imams of the Muslims stipulated &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;that non-Muslims should not celebrate their festivals OPENLY in the lands of the Muslims; rather they should do that privately in their house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On every Eid day, please do wish happy Eid to the moderate Muslims (as they still have humanity in them and they don't follow the extremist Mullah or extremist Islam), but please also try to make people aware of this danger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't take it lightly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At moment Muslims are weak and they only prohibit their children to wish the non-Muslims and tell them to keep hatred against their festivals in their hearts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as soon as Muslims get enough power, then in the next step, they are going to prohibit the non-Muslims from even celebrating their festivals while all these festivals are from the Devil.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we already have a Ban on Valentine's Day in Pakistan. And this ban is not from the extremist Muslims, but it is from the Government of Pakistan and from the High Court of Islamabad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PS: Muslim claim that Atheists don't have any festival of their own&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslims told me on Eid (a few years ago), Atheists have no festivals of their own as it is not a system but a disease, and thus Ex-Muslims atheists still celebrate Eid and Ex-Christian atheists still celebrate Christmas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told them, people celebrate due to their human nature, and not due to religion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many countries and cultures, the start of spring is celebrated as a festival. For example, Iranians have the Norouz, which was again related to starting of the spring season.  Chinese also celebrate the start of the spring season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then humanity started the celebrations of &quot;mother's day&quot; and &quot;father's day&quot; which are based on love and totally non-religious festivals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then humanity started the celebration of &quot;Valentine's Day&quot;, which is again not a religious festival but based upon love and human nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of celebrations in schools and colleges and universities and all of them are non-religious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of traditional celebrations in every part of the world and they are also non-religious in nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans don't need Allah to celebrate the festivals, but we need to follow our human nature and use our brains to get rid of Allah's monopoly on the festivals. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Muslims! Are the 'minorities' also 'human beings' in your eyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as you were unaware that Islamic law forces a slave woman to provide sexual services to her owner, and that you only became aware of this aspect of Islamic law after the establishment of ISIS. Similarly, you are unaware of that dark corner of Islam where Islamic law does not treat minorities as humans but rather commands them to be treated as animals and subjects them to humiliation and degradation, considering it a matter of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.29&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قَٰتِلُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَلَا بِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَلَا يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَلَا يَدِينُونَ دِينَ ٱلْحَقِّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ حَتَّىٰ يُعْطُوا۟ ٱلْجِزْيَةَ عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;صَٰغِرُونَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fight against the People given the Book(s) who do not accept faith in Allah and the Last Day, and who do not treat as forbidden what is forbidden by Allah and by His Noble Messenger, and who do not follow the true religion, until they pay the tariff (tax) with their own hands with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;humiliation (disgraced/belittled).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here صَـغِرُونَ is an Arabic word, which means humiliation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=9&amp;amp;vid=29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). This same word has also been used in the Quran in verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/7/119/default.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;7:119&lt;/a&gt;) and verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/27/37/default.htm&quot;&gt;27:37&lt;/a&gt;) with the same meaning of &quot;Humiliation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ibn Kathir recorded an incident of how the 2nd Caliph Umar Ibn Khattab dealt with non-Muslims of Syria by humiliating them. Ibn Kathir writes under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alim.org/quran/tafsir/ibn-kathir/surah/9/28/&quot;&gt;commentary of verse 9:29&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... [{ وَهُمْ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;صَٰغِرُونَ&lt;/span&gt; } أي &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;ذليلون حقيرون مهانون&lt;/span&gt;]  And &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;صَٰغِرُونَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; means &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;disgraced, humiliated and belittled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Muslims are not allowed to honor the people of Dhimmah or elevate them above Muslims, for they are (أذلاء صغرة أشقياء) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;miserable, disgraced and humiliated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Imam Muslim recorded (a hadith) from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;Do not initiate the Salam to the Jews and Christians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and if you meet any of them in a road,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0007ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; force them to its narrowest alley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the Leader of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, demanded his well-known conditions be met by the Christians, these conditions that ensured their continued &lt;strong&gt;( إذلالهم وتصغيرهم وتحقيرهم) humiliation, degradation and disgrace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scholars of Hadith narrated from `Abdur-Rahman bin Ghanm Al-Ash`ari that he said, &quot;I recorded for `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, the terms of the treaty of peace he conducted with the Christians of Ash-Sham: `In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. This is a document to the servant of Allah `Umar, the Leader of the faithful, from the Christians of such and such city. When you (Muslims) came to us we requested safety for ourselves, children, property and followers of our religion. We made a condition on ourselves that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will neither erect in our areas a monastery, church, or a sanctuary for a monk, nor restore any place of worship that needs restoration nor use any of them for the purpose of enmity against Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not prevent any Muslim from resting in our churches whether they come by day or night, and we will open the doors of our houses of worship for the wayfarer and passerby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those Muslims who come as guests, will enjoy boarding and food for three days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not allow a spy against Muslims into our churches and homes or hide deceit or betrayal against Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not teach our children the Qur'an, publicize practices of Shirk, invite anyone to Shirk or prevent any of our fellows from embracing Islam, if they choose to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will respect Muslims, move from the places we sit in if they choose to sit in them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not imitate their clothing, caps, turbans, sandals, hairstyles, speech, nicknames and title names,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or ride on saddles, hang swords on the shoulders, collect weapons of any kind or carry these weapons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not encrypt our stamps in Arabic, or sell liquor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will have the front of our hair cut (i.e. we will shave all hairs from the front side of our heads in order to be immediately recognised by Muslims that we are non-Muslims).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will wear our customary clothes wherever we are, wear belts around our waist,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will refrain from erecting crosses on the outside of our churches and demonstrating them and our books in public in Muslim fairways and markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not sound the bells in our churches, except discretely, or raise our voices while reciting our holy books inside our churches in the presence of Muslims, nor raise our voices with prayer at our funerals, or light torches in funeral processions in the fairways of Muslims, or their markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not bury our dead next to Muslim dead,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not buy servants who were captured by Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be guides for Muslims and refrain from breaching their privacy in their homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I gave this document to `Umar, he added to it, `We will not beat any Muslim. These are the conditions that we set against ourselves and followers of our religion in return for safety and protection. If we break any of these promises that we set for your benefit against ourselves, then our Dhimmah (promise of protection) is broken and you are allowed to do with us what you are allowed of people of defiance and rebellion.'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This treaty is such a humiliation to humanity that Islamic preachers don't find any excuses for it. Their initial reaction is to somehow reject this treaty by making any excuse (like denying it altogether). However, this is not possible because the Muslim scholars themselves have deemed this treaty as 'authentic' and have incorporated it as a part of Islamic jurisprudence, considering it a fundamental aspect of Islamic law. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/TgNbldWj&quot;&gt;Ibn Hazm &lt;/a&gt; (Grade: Authentic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/j5RqRE92&quot;&gt;Abdul Haq al-Asbaili&lt;/a&gt; (Grade: Authentic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/TWTUqh5s&quot;&gt;Ibn Qayyim&lt;/a&gt; (Grade: Acceptable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/Cz6l0C99&quot;&gt;Ibn Kathir&lt;/a&gt; (Grade: Jayyad جيد)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170115185953/https://books.google.de/books?id=6oC7XkMmkUUC&amp;amp;pg=PT513&amp;amp;lpg=PT513&amp;amp;dq=%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B1+%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89+%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=qJA9cGSS7a&amp;amp;sig=-6uXEFfQpEkdhyQk1tCw_sQVUGI&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMIzpnjwvSHyAIVwscUCh1kPwSX#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89%20%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah (Grade: Jayyad جيد)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this pact of Umar is also proved to be true without any doubts due to the presence of a letter, that Imam Abu Yousuf (the Chief Justice of Harun al-Rashid) wrote to the caliph. We will read this letter later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir mentioned above a hadith from Imam Muslim. Here it is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/39/16&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2167a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;arabic_sanad arabic&quot;&gt;عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;arabic_text_details arabic&quot;&gt;&quot;‏ لاَ تَبْدَءُوا الْيَهُودَ وَلاَ النَّصَارَى بِالسَّلاَمِ فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمْ أَحَدَهُمْ فِي طَرِيقٍ فَاضْطَرُّوهُ إِلَى أَضْيَقِهِ ‏&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;arabic_sanad arabic&quot;&gt;‏ ‏.‏&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not greet the Jews and the Christians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;before they greet you&lt;/em&gt; and when you meet any one of them on the roads&lt;span style=&quot;color: #084800;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; force him (them) to go to the narrowest part of it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir also mentioned above a hadith from Imam Tirmidhi. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/21/65&quot;&gt;Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1602&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;Narrated Abu Hurairah: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: &quot;Do not precede the Jews and the Christians with the Salam. And if one you meets one of them in the path, then force him to its narrow portion.&quot; ..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;[Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. And regarding the meaning of this Hadith: &quot;Do not precede the Jews and the Christians&quot;: Some of the poeple of knowledge said that it only means that it is disliked because it would be honoring them,&lt;strong&gt; and the Muslims were ordered to humiliate them&lt;/strong&gt;. For this reason, when one of them is met on the path, then the path is not yielded for him, because doing so would amount to honoring them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no excuse for such xenophobic behaviour and even the Humanity within Muslims makes it impossible for them to accept such Sharia orders (i.e. not to initiate greetings to non-Muslim minorities, in order to belittle them). Therefore, Muslims came up with an excuse that these orders were specific to the incident of Banu Qurayzah, while there was a war-like situation between them and the Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a lame excuse. The orders in the Hadith are not limited to the Banu Qurayzah incident, but these are the &quot;General&quot; orders for &quot;all times&quot; and for &quot;all&quot; the non-Muslims who are living in an Islamic State and paying the Jizya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banu Qurayzah were only &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but the hadith is very clear that &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jews and the Christians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; should not be greeted and should be pushed on the corner of the road. Thus, Muslim deception is not going to work here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details can be read &lt;a href=&quot;https://deovolentenl-nl.translate.goog/project/4785/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The purpose of Jizya is to humiliate non-Muslims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim preachers claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jizya is not to humiliate non-Muslims. But it is for their protection, and making them free from the obligation of taking part in Jihad for the Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not true, while: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Islamic States are engaged in &quot;offensive&quot; wars in the name of Jihad (spreading the religion of Allah). Why should non-Muslims contribute to it? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Muslim, even if he does not participate in a war, then he has to pay no Jizya tax. But if a non-Muslim does not participate, then he has to pay Jizya. Are you able to see the difference? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if Muslims participated in the wars, then they got a share in the &quot;War Booty&quot;. But non-Muslim minorities got absolutely no share in the war booty, despite paying Jizyah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quranic verse is very clear that humiliation is a part of Jizya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hadith is clear about this humiliation of non-Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islamic Jurisprudence (4 Fiqh Imams) are clear about this humiliation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islamic History is clear about this humiliation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Bakr al-Jassas wrote in his book &quot;Ahkam-ul-Quran&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://shamela.ws/book/23579/1444#p1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;لَيْسَ أَخْذُ الْجِزْيَةِ مِنْهُمْ رِضًا بِكُفْرِهِمْ وَلَا إبَاحَةً لِبَقَائِهِمْ عَلَى شِرْكِهِمْ وَإِنَّمَا الْجِزْيَةُ عُقُوبَةٌ لَهُمْ لِإِقَامَتِهِمْ عَلَى الْكُفْرِ ۔۔۔ إمْهَالُهُمْ بِالْجِزْيَةِ جَائِزٌ فِي الْعَقْلِ إذْ لَيْسَ فِيهِ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ تَعْجِيلِ بَعْضِ عِقَابِهِمْ الْمُسْتَحَقِّ بِكُفْرِهِمْ وَهُوَ مَا يَلْحَقُهُمْ مِنْ الذُّلِّ وَالصَّغَارِ بِأَدَائِهَا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking jizyah from the disbelievers does not imply approval of their disbelief or granting permission for them to persist in their polytheism. Jizyah is a punishment imposed on them for their disbelief. Rationally and logically, it is permissible to collect jizyah and grant them respite because nothing more is done through this method than delivering the deserved punishment for their disbelief. A portion of this punishment is implemented upon them in the form of humiliation and degradation, which is incurred upon them through the payment of jizyah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Imam Surkhisi wrote in his book &quot;al-Mabsoot&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/8A/8AA4E8DB98BE1113CD1C22E80AA6AD7D_%C6%92%CE%98%CE%A9%C3%A1%C2%BD%CF%86%C3%9F10.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أنه إذا سكن دار السلم فما دام مصرا على كفره ل يخل عن صغار وعقوبة وذلك بالجزية التى تؤخذ منه ليكون ذلك دليل على ذل الكافر وعز المؤمن &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a disbeliever resides in the abode of peace (Dar al-Islam) and persists in his disbelief, he should not be exempt from humiliation, punishment, and subjugation. This is achieved through the collection of jizyah from him, which serves as evidence of the humiliation of the disbeliever and the honor of the believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decrease in Jizya Tax due to forced conversion to Islam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the jizya was to humiliate and demean the Dhimmis (non-Muslims living under Islamic rule). As a result, the Dhimmis became so frustrated with these restrictions that they began converting to Islam &quot;under duress,&quot; leading to a decrease in jizya revenue. In response, the Muslim ruler decreed that the Dhimmis, despite converting to Islam, would still be subjected to Jizya as before, ensuring that government revenue would not decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Athir (a Muslim historian) recorded in his book al-Kamil (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/3496_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%AC-%D9%A4/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_463&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أن عمال الحجاج كتبوا اليه أن الخراج قد انكسر وان أهل الذمة قد أسلموا ولحقوا بالأمصار فكتب إلى البصرة وغيرها أن من كان له أصل من قرية فليخرج إليها فأخرج الناس لتؤخذ منهم الجزية فجعلوا يبكون وينادون يا محمداه يا محمداه ولا يدرون أين يذهبون&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;al-Hajjaj's administrators wrote to him that the tax revenues had decreased and that the dhimmis (non-Muslim citizens) had converted to Islam and migrated to the cities. Thus, he wrote to Basra and other places, instructing that those people (i.e. those Dhimmi non-Muslims who converted to Islam, and) with roots in a village should return there, intending to collect the Jizya (from those ex-Dhimmis). The newly converted people (i.e. ex-Dhimmis) started to weep and cry out, &quot;O Muhammad! O Muhammad!&quot; without knowing where to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restrictions on Clothing of Non-Muslims in Islamic Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abu Yusuf was a student of Imam Abu Hanifa, and during the era of Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he served as the Chief Judge (Qadi al-Qudat) in the Islamic state. In his book titled &quot;Kitab al-Kharaj,&quot; he discussed the issues of jizyah (tax) and the responsibilities of non-Muslim subjects according to Islamic law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the clothing of non-Muslims, he wrote to Caliph Harun al-Rashid (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150921092545/http://www.islamport.com/b/3/alhadeeth/ajzaa/%DF%CA%C7%C8%20%C7%E1%CE%D1%C7%CC%20%E1%C3%C8%ED%20%ED%E6%D3%DD/%DF%CA%C7%C8%20%C7%E1%CE%D1%C7%CC%20%E1%C3%C8%ED%20%ED%E6%D3%DD%20%20003.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وأن يتقدم في أن لا يترك أحد منهم يتشبه بالمسمين في لباسه ولا في مركبه ولا في هيئته ، ويؤخذوا بأن يجعلوا في أوساطهم الزنارات – مثل الخيط الغليط يعقده في وسطه كل واحد منهم – وبأن تكون قلانسهم مضربة ، وأن يتخذوا على سروجهم في موضع القرابيس مثل الرمانة من خشب ، وبأن يجعلوا شراك نعالهم مثنية ، ولا يحذوا على حذو المسلمين ، وتمنع نساؤهم من ركوب الرحائل&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(... the Caliph should order that) It is required that none of them (non-Muslims) should resemble Muslims in their clothing, modes of transportation, or appearance. They should be distinguished by wearing belts (like a distinctive knot) in their waists, and their caps should have distinctive marks. Additionally, they should use only those saddles for riding, which are used to transport woods. Their footwear should have double laces, and they should not imitate the way Muslims dress. Furthermore, their women should be prohibited from riding on saddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; None of the other Muslim scholars of that era opposed this ruling by calling it an &quot;innovation&quot; (Bida'h بدعة). This shows a &quot;consensus&quot; (Ijma إجماع) of early Islamic scholars on this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restrictions on Non-Muslims to Establish New Places of Worship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Imam Abu Yusuf mentions the imposition of restrictions on non-Muslims regarding the establishment of their places of worship. He wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150921092545/http://www.islamport.com/b/3/alhadeeth/ajzaa/%DF%CA%C7%C8%20%C7%E1%CE%D1%C7%CC%20%E1%C3%C8%ED%20%ED%E6%D3%DD/%DF%CA%C7%C8%20%C7%E1%CE%D1%C7%CC%20%E1%C3%C8%ED%20%ED%E6%D3%DD%20%20003.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ويمنعوا من أن يحدثوا بناء بيعة أو كنيسة في المدينة إلا ما كانوا صولحوا عليه وصاروا ذمة وهي بيعة لهم أو كنيسة ، فما كان كذلك تركت لهم ولم تهدم ، وكذلك بيوت النيران ، ويتركون يسكنون في أمصار المسلمين وأسواقهم يبيعون ويشترون ولا يبيعون خمرا ولا خنزيرا ولا يظهرون الصلبان في الأمصار ، ولتكن قلانسهم طوالا مضربة ، فمر عمالك أن يأخذوا أهل الذمة بهذا الزي . هكذا كان عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه أمر عماله أن يأخذوا أهل الذمة بهذا الزي وقال : حتى يعرف زيهم من زي المسلمين.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are prohibited from constructing new covenant or church buildings in the city, except those that have been agreed upon and become part of their treaty. If such buildings already exist, they are allowed to keep them and they should not be demolished.&lt;/strong&gt; .. They are permitted to reside in Muslim territories and their markets, engage in buying and selling, but they are prohibited from trading in wine and pork, and they should not display crosses in Muslim territories. Their clothing should include a distinctive belt, which should be longer in length. It is the responsibility of the authorities to ensure that the people of the treaty adhere to this dress code. &lt;strong&gt;This was the directive of Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, to his officials regarding the attire of the people of the treaty, stating that they should be easily distinguishable from Muslims by their attire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This letter is sufficient proof that Umar's pact with the Syrian Christians is indeed true, and Muslim apologists are wrong when they try to cast doubts about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Imam Abu Yusuf (died 798 AH) quoted a letter from Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (died 720 AH) in his book &quot;Kitab al-Kharaj,&quot; in which Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz strongly admonished his governor for easing the strictness of the regulations concerning the humiliation and disgrace of Christians and Jews (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?indexstartno=0&amp;amp;hflag=&amp;amp;pid=6270&amp;amp;bk_no=34&amp;amp;startno=192&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;قال أبو يوسف : وحدثني عبد الرحمن بن ثابت بن ثوبان عن أبيه ان عمر بن عبد العزيز كتب إلى عامل له : أما بعد ، فلا تدعن صليبا ظاهرا إلا كسر – 138 – ومحق ، ولا يركبن يهودي ولا نصراني على سرج ، وليركب على إكاف ، ولا تركبن امرأة من نسائهم على رحالة وليكن ركوبها على إكاف . وتقدم في ذلك تقدما بليغا ، وتقدم في ذلك تقدما بليغا ، وامنع من قبلك من النصارى قد راجعوا لبس العمائم وتركوا المناطق فلا يلبس نصراني قباء ولا ثوب خز ولا عصب ، وقد ذكر لي أن كثيرا ممن قبلك من النصارى قدر راجعوا لبس العمائم وتركوا المناطق على أوساطهم واتخذوا الجمام والوفر وتركوا التقصيص ، ولعمري لئن كان يصنع ذلك فيما قبلك ، إن ذلك بك لضعف وعجز ومصانعة ، وانهم حين يراجعون ذلك فيما قبلك ، إن ذلك بك لضعف وعجز ومصانعةن ، وانهم حين يراجعون ذلك ليعلموا ما أنت ، فانظر كل شيء نهيت عنه فاحسم عنه من فعله والسلام .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;nass margin-top-10&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz wrote to one of his officials saying, &quot;After that, do not let a visible cross remain intact in public, but break and obliterate it. Neither should a Jew nor a Christian ride on saddles; they should ride on the hump of the camel. Women among them should not ride on a riding beast, and if they do, it should be on the hump of the camel. You should emphasize this strictly. Christians had started the wearing of turbans (just like Muslims) and abandoned their distinctive clothing in front of you. So a Christian should not wear a Quba'a (a type of head covering) nor a garment made of fine wool or silk. It has been mentioned to me that many Christians in font of you, had adopted the wearing of turbans and abandoned their distinctive clothing, and instead, they used the jamam (a specific type of headdress) and wofur (a type of garment) and abandoned the qass (a type of footwear). By my life, if they had done that before you, it would have been a sign of your weakness, incapability, and incompetence. When they reconsidered and abandoned those practices, it was to know who you are. Therefore, pay attention to everything I have forbidden, and decisively prevent them from doing so. Peace be upon you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) has also narrated similar principles for non-Muslims, and Imam Shafi'i has mentioned the same in his book Al-Umm (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pact_of_Umar&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) regarding this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad ibn Naqib al-Misri (1302 - 1368 AD, Shafi'i) wrote in Umdat as-Salik (p. 236):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-12 text-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o11.5 “They (the Dhimmis) are obliged to comply with Islamic rules that pertain to the safety and indemnity of life, reputation, and property. In addition, they: ... are distinguished from Muslims in dress, wearing a wide cloth belt, are not greeted with As-Salamu Alaykum, must keep to the side of the street, may not build higher than or as high as the Muslims' buildings - though if they acquire a tall house - it is not razed, are forbidden to openly display wine or pork, recite the Torah or Gospel aloud, or make public display of their funerals and feastdays, and are forbidden to build new churches.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as you were unaware that Islamic law forces a slave woman to provide sexual services to her owner, and that you only became aware of this aspect of Islamic law after the establishment of ISIS. Similarly, you are unaware of that dark corner of Islam where Islamic law does not treat minorities as humans but rather commands them to be treated as animals and subjects them to humiliation and degradation, considering it a matter of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quran &lt;a href=&quot;https://quranx.com/9.29&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;قَٰتِلُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَلَا بِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ وَلَا يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَلَا يَدِينُونَ دِينَ ٱلْحَقِّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ حَتَّىٰ يُعْطُوا۟ ٱلْجِزْيَةَ عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;صَٰغِرُونَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fight against the People given the Book(s) who do not accept faith in Allah and the Last Day, and who do not treat as forbidden what is forbidden by Allah and by His Noble Messenger, and who do not follow the true religion, until they pay the tariff (tax) with their own hands with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;humiliation (disgraced/belittled).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here صَـغِرُونَ is an Arabic word, which means humiliation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://openburhan.net/ob.php?sid=9&amp;amp;vid=29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). This same word has also been used in the Quran in verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/7/119/default.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;7:119&lt;/a&gt;) and verse (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/27/37/default.htm&quot;&gt;27:37&lt;/a&gt;) with the same meaning of &quot;Humiliation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ibn Kathir recorded an incident of how the 2nd Caliph Umar Ibn Khattab dealt with non-Muslims of Syria by humiliating them. Ibn Kathir writes under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alim.org/quran/tafsir/ibn-kathir/surah/9/28/&quot;&gt;commentary of verse 9:29&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... [{ وَهُمْ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;صَٰغِرُونَ&lt;/span&gt; } أي &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;ذليلون حقيرون مهانون&lt;/span&gt;]  And &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba372a;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;صَٰغِرُونَ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; means &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;disgraced, humiliated and belittled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Muslims are not allowed to honor the people of Dhimmah or elevate them above Muslims, for they are (أذلاء صغرة أشقياء) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;miserable, disgraced and humiliated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Imam Muslim recorded (a hadith) from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;Do not initiate the Salam to the Jews and Christians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and if you meet any of them in a road,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0007ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; force them to its narrowest alley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the Leader of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, demanded his well-known conditions be met by the Christians, these conditions that ensured their continued &lt;strong&gt;( إذلالهم وتصغيرهم وتحقيرهم) humiliation, degradation and disgrace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scholars of Hadith narrated from `Abdur-Rahman bin Ghanm Al-Ash`ari that he said, &quot;I recorded for `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, the terms of the treaty of peace he conducted with the Christians of Ash-Sham: `In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. This is a document to the servant of Allah `Umar, the Leader of the faithful, from the Christians of such and such city. When you (Muslims) came to us we requested safety for ourselves, children, property and followers of our religion. We made a condition on ourselves that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will neither erect in our areas a monastery, church, or a sanctuary for a monk, nor restore any place of worship that needs restoration nor use any of them for the purpose of enmity against Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not prevent any Muslim from resting in our churches whether they come by day or night, and we will open the doors of our houses of worship for the wayfarer and passerby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those Muslims who come as guests, will enjoy boarding and food for three days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not allow a spy against Muslims into our churches and homes or hide deceit or betrayal against Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not teach our children the Qur'an, publicize practices of Shirk, invite anyone to Shirk or prevent any of our fellows from embracing Islam, if they choose to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will respect Muslims, move from the places we sit in if they choose to sit in them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not imitate their clothing, caps, turbans, sandals, hairstyles, speech, nicknames and title names,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or ride on saddles, hang swords on the shoulders, collect weapons of any kind or carry these weapons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not encrypt our stamps in Arabic, or sell liquor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will have the front of our hair cut (i.e. we will shave all hairs from the front side of our heads in order to be immediately recognised by Muslims that we are non-Muslims).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will wear our customary clothes wherever we are, wear belts around our waist,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will refrain from erecting crosses on the outside of our churches and demonstrating them and our books in public in Muslim fairways and markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not sound the bells in our churches, except discretely, or raise our voices while reciting our holy books inside our churches in the presence of Muslims, nor raise our voices with prayer at our funerals, or light torches in funeral processions in the fairways of Muslims, or their markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not bury our dead next to Muslim dead,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not buy servants who were captured by Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be guides for Muslims and refrain from breaching their privacy in their homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I gave this document to `Umar, he added to it, `We will not beat any Muslim. These are the conditions that we set against ourselves and followers of our religion in return for safety and protection. If we break any of these promises that we set for your benefit against ourselves, then our Dhimmah (promise of protection) is broken and you are allowed to do with us what you are allowed of people of defiance and rebellion.'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This treaty is such a humiliation to humanity that Islamic preachers don't find any excuses for it. Their initial reaction is to somehow reject this treaty by making any excuse (like denying it altogether). However, this is not possible because the Muslim scholars themselves have deemed this treaty as 'authentic' and have incorporated it as a part of Islamic jurisprudence, considering it a fundamental aspect of Islamic law. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/TgNbldWj&quot;&gt;Ibn Hazm &lt;/a&gt; (Grade: Authentic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/j5RqRE92&quot;&gt;Abdul Haq al-Asbaili&lt;/a&gt; (Grade: Authentic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/TWTUqh5s&quot;&gt;Ibn Qayyim&lt;/a&gt; (Grade: Acceptable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dorar.net/h/Cz6l0C99&quot;&gt;Ibn Kathir&lt;/a&gt; (Grade: Jayyad جيد)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170115185953/https://books.google.de/books?id=6oC7XkMmkUUC&amp;amp;pg=PT513&amp;amp;lpg=PT513&amp;amp;dq=%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B1+%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89+%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=qJA9cGSS7a&amp;amp;sig=-6uXEFfQpEkdhyQk1tCw_sQVUGI&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMIzpnjwvSHyAIVwscUCh1kPwSX#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89%20%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah (Grade: Jayyad جيد)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this pact of Umar is also proved to be true without any doubts due to the presence of a letter, that Imam Abu Yousuf (the Chief Justice of Harun al-Rashid) wrote to the caliph. We will read this letter later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir mentioned above a hadith from Imam Muslim. Here it is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/muslim/39/16&quot;&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2167a&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;arabic_sanad arabic&quot;&gt;عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;arabic_text_details arabic&quot;&gt;&quot;‏ لاَ تَبْدَءُوا الْيَهُودَ وَلاَ النَّصَارَى بِالسَّلاَمِ فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمْ أَحَدَهُمْ فِي طَرِيقٍ فَاضْطَرُّوهُ إِلَى أَضْيَقِهِ ‏&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;arabic_sanad arabic&quot;&gt;‏ ‏.‏&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e67e23;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not greet the Jews and the Christians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;before they greet you&lt;/em&gt; and when you meet any one of them on the roads&lt;span style=&quot;color: #084800;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; force him (them) to go to the narrowest part of it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Kathir also mentioned above a hadith from Imam Tirmidhi. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/21/65&quot;&gt;Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1602&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hadith_narrated&quot;&gt;Narrated Abu Hurairah: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: &quot;Do not precede the Jews and the Christians with the Salam. And if one you meets one of them in the path, then force him to its narrow portion.&quot; ..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;[Abu 'Eisa said:] This Hadith is Hasan Sahih. And regarding the meaning of this Hadith: &quot;Do not precede the Jews and the Christians&quot;: Some of the poeple of knowledge said that it only means that it is disliked because it would be honoring them,&lt;strong&gt; and the Muslims were ordered to humiliate them&lt;/strong&gt;. For this reason, when one of them is met on the path, then the path is not yielded for him, because doing so would amount to honoring them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no excuse for such xenophobic behaviour and even the Humanity within Muslims makes it impossible for them to accept such Sharia orders (i.e. not to initiate greetings to non-Muslim minorities, in order to belittle them). Therefore, Muslims came up with an excuse that these orders were specific to the incident of Banu Qurayzah, while there was a war-like situation between them and the Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a lame excuse. The orders in the Hadith are not limited to the Banu Qurayzah incident, but these are the &quot;General&quot; orders for &quot;all times&quot; and for &quot;all&quot; the non-Muslims who are living in an Islamic State and paying the Jizya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banu Qurayzah were only &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but the hadith is very clear that &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jews and the Christians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; should not be greeted and should be pushed on the corner of the road. Thus, Muslim deception is not going to work here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details can be read &lt;a href=&quot;https://deovolentenl-nl.translate.goog/project/4785/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The purpose of Jizya is to humiliate non-Muslims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muslim preachers claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jizya is not to humiliate non-Muslims. But it is for their protection, and making them free from the obligation of taking part in Jihad for the Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not true, while: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Islamic States are engaged in &quot;offensive&quot; wars in the name of Jihad (spreading the religion of Allah). Why should non-Muslims contribute to it? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Muslim, even if he does not participate in a war, then he has to pay no Jizya tax. But if a non-Muslim does not participate, then he has to pay Jizya. Are you able to see the difference? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if Muslims participated in the wars, then they got a share in the &quot;War Booty&quot;. But non-Muslim minorities got absolutely no share in the war booty, despite paying Jizyah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quranic verse is very clear that humiliation is a part of Jizya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hadith is clear about this humiliation of non-Muslims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islamic Jurisprudence (4 Fiqh Imams) are clear about this humiliation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islamic History is clear about this humiliation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Bakr al-Jassas wrote in his book &quot;Ahkam-ul-Quran&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://shamela.ws/book/23579/1444#p1&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;لَيْسَ أَخْذُ الْجِزْيَةِ مِنْهُمْ رِضًا بِكُفْرِهِمْ وَلَا إبَاحَةً لِبَقَائِهِمْ عَلَى شِرْكِهِمْ وَإِنَّمَا الْجِزْيَةُ عُقُوبَةٌ لَهُمْ لِإِقَامَتِهِمْ عَلَى الْكُفْرِ ۔۔۔ إمْهَالُهُمْ بِالْجِزْيَةِ جَائِزٌ فِي الْعَقْلِ إذْ لَيْسَ فِيهِ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ تَعْجِيلِ بَعْضِ عِقَابِهِمْ الْمُسْتَحَقِّ بِكُفْرِهِمْ وَهُوَ مَا يَلْحَقُهُمْ مِنْ الذُّلِّ وَالصَّغَارِ بِأَدَائِهَا&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking jizyah from the disbelievers does not imply approval of their disbelief or granting permission for them to persist in their polytheism. Jizyah is a punishment imposed on them for their disbelief. Rationally and logically, it is permissible to collect jizyah and grant them respite because nothing more is done through this method than delivering the deserved punishment for their disbelief. A portion of this punishment is implemented upon them in the form of humiliation and degradation, which is incurred upon them through the payment of jizyah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Imam Surkhisi wrote in his book &quot;al-Mabsoot&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/8A/8AA4E8DB98BE1113CD1C22E80AA6AD7D_%C6%92%CE%98%CE%A9%C3%A1%C2%BD%CF%86%C3%9F10.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أنه إذا سكن دار السلم فما دام مصرا على كفره ل يخل عن صغار وعقوبة وذلك بالجزية التى تؤخذ منه ليكون ذلك دليل على ذل الكافر وعز المؤمن &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a disbeliever resides in the abode of peace (Dar al-Islam) and persists in his disbelief, he should not be exempt from humiliation, punishment, and subjugation. This is achieved through the collection of jizyah from him, which serves as evidence of the humiliation of the disbeliever and the honor of the believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decrease in Jizya Tax due to forced conversion to Islam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the jizya was to humiliate and demean the Dhimmis (non-Muslims living under Islamic rule). As a result, the Dhimmis became so frustrated with these restrictions that they began converting to Islam &quot;under duress,&quot; leading to a decrease in jizya revenue. In response, the Muslim ruler decreed that the Dhimmis, despite converting to Islam, would still be subjected to Jizya as before, ensuring that government revenue would not decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Athir (a Muslim historian) recorded in his book al-Kamil (&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/3496_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AB%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%AC-%D9%A4/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_463&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;أن عمال الحجاج كتبوا اليه أن الخراج قد انكسر وان أهل الذمة قد أسلموا ولحقوا بالأمصار فكتب إلى البصرة وغيرها أن من كان له أصل من قرية فليخرج إليها فأخرج الناس لتؤخذ منهم الجزية فجعلوا يبكون وينادون يا محمداه يا محمداه ولا يدرون أين يذهبون&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;al-Hajjaj's administrators wrote to him that the tax revenues had decreased and that the dhimmis (non-Muslim citizens) had converted to Islam and migrated to the cities. Thus, he wrote to Basra and other places, instructing that those people (i.e. those Dhimmi non-Muslims who converted to Islam, and) with roots in a village should return there, intending to collect the Jizya (from those ex-Dhimmis). The newly converted people (i.e. ex-Dhimmis) started to weep and cry out, &quot;O Muhammad! O Muhammad!&quot; without knowing where to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restrictions on Clothing of Non-Muslims in Islamic Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Abu Yusuf was a student of Imam Abu Hanifa, and during the era of Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he served as the Chief Judge (Qadi al-Qudat) in the Islamic state. In his book titled &quot;Kitab al-Kharaj,&quot; he discussed the issues of jizyah (tax) and the responsibilities of non-Muslim subjects according to Islamic law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the clothing of non-Muslims, he wrote to Caliph Harun al-Rashid (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150921092545/http://www.islamport.com/b/3/alhadeeth/ajzaa/%DF%CA%C7%C8%20%C7%E1%CE%D1%C7%CC%20%E1%C3%C8%ED%20%ED%E6%D3%DD/%DF%CA%C7%C8%20%C7%E1%CE%D1%C7%CC%20%E1%C3%C8%ED%20%ED%E6%D3%DD%20%20003.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;وأن يتقدم في أن لا يترك أحد منهم يتشبه بالمسمين في لباسه ولا في مركبه ولا في هيئته ، ويؤخذوا بأن يجعلوا في أوساطهم الزنارات – مثل الخيط الغليط يعقده في وسطه كل واحد منهم – وبأن تكون قلانسهم مضربة ، وأن يتخذوا على سروجهم في موضع القرابيس مثل الرمانة من خشب ، وبأن يجعلوا شراك نعالهم مثنية ، ولا يحذوا على حذو المسلمين ، وتمنع نساؤهم من ركوب الرحائل&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(... the Caliph should order that) It is required that none of them (non-Muslims) should resemble Muslims in their clothing, modes of transportation, or appearance. They should be distinguished by wearing belts (like a distinctive knot) in their waists, and their caps should have distinctive marks. Additionally, they should use only those saddles for riding, which are used to transport woods. Their footwear should have double laces, and they should not imitate the way Muslims dress. Furthermore, their women should be prohibited from riding on saddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; None of the other Muslim scholars of that era opposed this ruling by calling it an &quot;innovation&quot; (Bida'h بدعة). This shows a &quot;consensus&quot; (Ijma إجماع) of early Islamic scholars on this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restrictions on Non-Muslims to Establish New Places of Worship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Imam Abu Yusuf mentions the imposition of restrictions on non-Muslims regarding the establishment of their places of worship. He wrote (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20150921092545/http://www.islamport.com/b/3/alhadeeth/ajzaa/%DF%CA%C7%C8%20%C7%E1%CE%D1%C7%CC%20%E1%C3%C8%ED%20%ED%E6%D3%DD/%DF%CA%C7%C8%20%C7%E1%CE%D1%C7%CC%20%E1%C3%C8%ED%20%ED%E6%D3%DD%20%20003.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ويمنعوا من أن يحدثوا بناء بيعة أو كنيسة في المدينة إلا ما كانوا صولحوا عليه وصاروا ذمة وهي بيعة لهم أو كنيسة ، فما كان كذلك تركت لهم ولم تهدم ، وكذلك بيوت النيران ، ويتركون يسكنون في أمصار المسلمين وأسواقهم يبيعون ويشترون ولا يبيعون خمرا ولا خنزيرا ولا يظهرون الصلبان في الأمصار ، ولتكن قلانسهم طوالا مضربة ، فمر عمالك أن يأخذوا أهل الذمة بهذا الزي . هكذا كان عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه أمر عماله أن يأخذوا أهل الذمة بهذا الزي وقال : حتى يعرف زيهم من زي المسلمين.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are prohibited from constructing new covenant or church buildings in the city, except those that have been agreed upon and become part of their treaty. If such buildings already exist, they are allowed to keep them and they should not be demolished.&lt;/strong&gt; .. They are permitted to reside in Muslim territories and their markets, engage in buying and selling, but they are prohibited from trading in wine and pork, and they should not display crosses in Muslim territories. Their clothing should include a distinctive belt, which should be longer in length. It is the responsibility of the authorities to ensure that the people of the treaty adhere to this dress code. &lt;strong&gt;This was the directive of Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, to his officials regarding the attire of the people of the treaty, stating that they should be easily distinguishable from Muslims by their attire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This letter is sufficient proof that Umar's pact with the Syrian Christians is indeed true, and Muslim apologists are wrong when they try to cast doubts about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Imam Abu Yusuf (died 798 AH) quoted a letter from Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (died 720 AH) in his book &quot;Kitab al-Kharaj,&quot; in which Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz strongly admonished his governor for easing the strictness of the regulations concerning the humiliation and disgrace of Christians and Jews (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.islamweb.net/hadith/display_hbook.php?indexstartno=0&amp;amp;hflag=&amp;amp;pid=6270&amp;amp;bk_no=34&amp;amp;startno=192&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;قال أبو يوسف : وحدثني عبد الرحمن بن ثابت بن ثوبان عن أبيه ان عمر بن عبد العزيز كتب إلى عامل له : أما بعد ، فلا تدعن صليبا ظاهرا إلا كسر – 138 – ومحق ، ولا يركبن يهودي ولا نصراني على سرج ، وليركب على إكاف ، ولا تركبن امرأة من نسائهم على رحالة وليكن ركوبها على إكاف . وتقدم في ذلك تقدما بليغا ، وتقدم في ذلك تقدما بليغا ، وامنع من قبلك من النصارى قد راجعوا لبس العمائم وتركوا المناطق فلا يلبس نصراني قباء ولا ثوب خز ولا عصب ، وقد ذكر لي أن كثيرا ممن قبلك من النصارى قدر راجعوا لبس العمائم وتركوا المناطق على أوساطهم واتخذوا الجمام والوفر وتركوا التقصيص ، ولعمري لئن كان يصنع ذلك فيما قبلك ، إن ذلك بك لضعف وعجز ومصانعة ، وانهم حين يراجعون ذلك فيما قبلك ، إن ذلك بك لضعف وعجز ومصانعةن ، وانهم حين يراجعون ذلك ليعلموا ما أنت ، فانظر كل شيء نهيت عنه فاحسم عنه من فعله والسلام .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;nass margin-top-10&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz wrote to one of his officials saying, &quot;After that, do not let a visible cross remain intact in public, but break and obliterate it. Neither should a Jew nor a Christian ride on saddles; they should ride on the hump of the camel. Women among them should not ride on a riding beast, and if they do, it should be on the hump of the camel. You should emphasize this strictly. Christians had started the wearing of turbans (just like Muslims) and abandoned their distinctive clothing in front of you. So a Christian should not wear a Quba'a (a type of head covering) nor a garment made of fine wool or silk. It has been mentioned to me that many Christians in font of you, had adopted the wearing of turbans and abandoned their distinctive clothing, and instead, they used the jamam (a specific type of headdress) and wofur (a type of garment) and abandoned the qass (a type of footwear). By my life, if they had done that before you, it would have been a sign of your weakness, incapability, and incompetence. When they reconsidered and abandoned those practices, it was to know who you are. Therefore, pay attention to everything I have forbidden, and decisively prevent them from doing so. Peace be upon you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) has also narrated similar principles for non-Muslims, and Imam Shafi'i has mentioned the same in his book Al-Umm (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pact_of_Umar&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) regarding this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad ibn Naqib al-Misri (1302 - 1368 AD, Shafi'i) wrote in Umdat as-Salik (p. 236):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;o11.5 “They (the Dhimmis) are obliged to comply with Islamic rules that pertain to the safety and indemnity of life, reputation, and property. In addition, they: ... are distinguished from Muslims in dress, wearing a wide cloth belt, are not greeted with As-Salamu Alaykum, must keep to the side of the street, may not build higher than or as high as the Muslims' buildings - though if they acquire a tall house - it is not razed, are forbidden to openly display wine or pork, recite the Torah or Gospel aloud, or make public display of their funerals and feastdays, and are forbidden to build new churches.”&lt;/p&gt;
